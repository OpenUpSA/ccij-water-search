After the war, water became an increasingly sparse resource due to the collapse of the DRC's infrastructure during the fighting.
In the DRC, the state water utility does not have the ability to improve its water pumping system, because they lack the funds to undertake the project.
According to the IRIN, only about 69 percent of the urban areas of the DRC receive water from the state water utility (IRIN News).
In the next four years, the government and outside humanitarian organizations hope to alleviate the water crisis in the DRC.",,,"war,drc,state,streams,irin,congolese,congo,democratic,nations,republic,spotlight,lack,utility,water",https://thewaterproject.org/images/favicon.png

Malnutrition is a result of multiple causes, such as lack of access to safe drinking water, sanitation services and failure to practice basic hygiene practices.

The sharp increase in access to safe drinking water by 2004 reflects the emergency assistance and humanitarian resources that flowed in following the peace agreement, but in some cases was not sustainable.
Angola has witnessed improved access to sanitation in the same period.
With the increasing oil revenue and more stability, safe drinking water and sanitation should become more accessible in both urban and rural areas.

An internal seiche at that time seemed associated with similar but less pronounced events at the other stations after cessation of the winds.
We suggest that internal seiching can spread kinetic energy throughout the lake, triggering upward nutrient fluxes through mixing elsewhere.
The response to water displacements in terms of nutrient supply to the epilimnion seems to be governed by differences in the strength of vertical temperature, and by nutrient and dissolved oxygen gradients.
That consequently affects the extent of internal nutrient loading throughout the lake and ultimately plays an important role in the lake trophic status.",,Show More Authors,"lake,upwelling,changes,rivers,primary,burundi,nutrient,strength,dissolved,discharging,internal,bujumbura,chlorophyll,production,tanganyika,quality,water",https://www.researchgate.net/images/template/default_publication_preview_large.png

[7], household water showed progressive contamination during storage, and in this study, 73% stored household water samples were contaminated with enteric bacteria.
It is based on this premise information gap about water contamination despite interventions that this study sought to assess the contamination potentials of household water handling and storage practices in Kirundo subcounty, Kisoro District, Uganda.
Presence of TC in drinking water contravenes the Uganda drinking water standard and World Health Organization drinking water guidelines of 0 CFUs/100 ml.
Factors that were found to be associated with bacterial contamination in the household water were age, education level, occupation, water storage container, and method of household water treatment.",,"Agensi,Tibyangye,Tamale,Agwu,Amongi,Alexander Agensi,Julius Tibyangye,...,Christine Amongi","handling,practices,household,kisoro,kirundo,samples,coli,uganda,contamination,contaminated,total,potentials,drinking,subcounty,storage,escherichia,water",https://images.hindawi.com/journals/jeph/jeph.banner.jpg

According to Chris, it was in September 2017 that World Vision completed the extension of piped water into Kisenyi B, constructed two public water kiosks and two stand taps.
With increased access to clean and safe piped water, the community now reports increased reduction in waterborne diseases among children (especially cholera).
Chris adds that having piped water in the village has also saved community members time that they previously used to look for water.

“Previously men and women have been fetching the water, but now due to schools’ closure, parents send their children to water sources and boys have taken advantage of that,” he adds.
“We are now starting a dry season (June to August); we are going to face a lot of challenges of domestic violence because of long queues at water sources.
It will force women who fetch water more than men to delay at water sources.
And usually men think that they were not at the water sources but had gone for other men,” he added.",2020-07-16,,"karangura,masereka,zone,young,crisis,violence,caught,pandemic,covid19,men,women,challenges,sources,water",https://pulitzercenter.org/sites/default/files/07-16-20/feature01pix.jpg
