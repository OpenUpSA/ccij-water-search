In 1998, the Democratic Republic of Congo became part of what some people called Africa's First World War, in a conflict between seven African nations. There are many reasons why the war broke out, including conflicts over minerals, water, and food. After the war, water became an increasingly sparse resource due to the collapse of the DRC's infrastructure during the fighting. Although the DRC use to be one of the wettest nations in Africa, today the majority of rural Congolese do not have access to sanitary water because of the lack of infrastructure. In fact a study carried out by the IRC found that since the war, most Congolese have not died from violence, but rather from malaria, diarrhea, and malnutrition, all problems associated with the lack of water (Global Issues).

In the DRC, the state water utility does not have the ability to improve its water pumping system, because they lack the funds to undertake the project. Instead, they continue to pump water to needy areas through rusty, decaying pipes. According to the IRIN, only about 69 percent of the urban areas of the DRC receive water from the state water utility (IRIN News). This means that there are a significant amount of citizens not receiving water to their towns and villages, resulting in the locals having to find other options to satisfy their need for water.

In a town in the northwestern district of the DRC, called Ewo, most locals are only able to get water from local streams and ponds - there are no water pipes coming in from the state water utility. One local man, named Romuald Onanga, who gets his water from those streams said, ""We've become used to drinking spring water because it is natural. It is not often associated with chemicals"" (IRIN News). However, what Onanga and others do not realize is that many of the streams they get their water from are contaminated with waste, chemicals, or bacteria, but it is their only source of water so they have no other choice but to drink unsafe water.

For the privileged Congolese, they have the ability to buy imported bottled water, but at a very steep price. One liter bottle of water costs about $1, which is extremely cheap to Americans, but for many Congolese who make less than $2 a day, it is an impossible luxury. As a result, those who do not have money do not have access to clean water.

In the next four years, the government and outside humanitarian organizations hope to alleviate the water crisis in the DRC. According to the minister of energy and water resources, the government is committed to providing clean water to all districts in the country, hoping to provide clean water to 75 percent of the country by 2015. In the end the DRC, as well as other African nations, is greatly in need of outside help to better its water system.

Nadine may seem relaxed this morning, but it hasn't always been like that.

Just a few months ago, the young mother had to walk more than 10 km every day to fetch water from the closest standpipe. 'It took me all day to get 20 litres of water for everyone at home,' she recalls.

Since the Ebola epidemic was declared in her province in August 2018, Nadine has been extremely worried about her family's health. Despite the fact it's close to Lake Kivu, Goma doesn't have a reliable drinking water supply. 'When we heard we needed to wash our hands to avoid catching Ebola, we wondered how we'd manage without water,' explains Nadine who lives in a district that doesn't have any water supply infrastructure.

To help local people carefully follow hygiene requirements and protect themselves against Ebola, UNICEF has installed water supply points in the most vulnerable parts of the city. The installation of a supply point near her house means that Nadine is no longer forced to travel long distances and the young mother can also be confident about the quality of water she uses.

Because drinking water supplies are scarce, and water from Lake Kivu is unfit for consumption, the local population is at high risk from many diseases. Monique, who manages one of the water supply points set up by UNICEF, is aware of how important it is for her community to have access to drinking water. 'We'll be pleased to see the back of Ebola, along with other diseases caused by the lack of clean water,' she said.

UNICEF and its partners have provided boreholes and water hydrants in communities that have recorded the highest number of Ebola patients. Since the epidemic started, more than 22,000 people have been provided with access to drinking water.

UNICEF’s response to the Ebola epidemic is supported by the World Bank, the European Commission – European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations, Gavi - the Vaccine Alliance, the United States Agency for International Development, the Central Emergency Response Fund and the Government of Japan. UNICEF is also supported by the German Committee for UNICEF, the World Bank Group’s Pandemic Emergency Financing Facility, the United Kingdom and the Paul G.

However, water security is low because of economic and governance constraints. Economic growth is negative in real terms, which limits the government’s basic infrastructure investments and maintenance. Constricted political space for civil society activity and limited social accountability, including on water and sanitation investments, further constrains the delivery of services. As a result, currently only 52 percent of the population has access to basic water and 29 percent has access to sanitation. Lack of access to water and sanitation, coupled with poor hygiene behaviors, are among the top five risk factors associated with death and disability in the country.

USAID is supporting the Government of the DRC to create and strengthen systems required to achieve the country’s water and sanitation targets, in alignment with the Global Water Strategy and the USAID Agency Specific Plan. USAID is addressing water and sanitation needs through large scale investments in health services and systems. USAID/DRC is implementing these activities by using two different models: 1) drinking water, sanitation, and hygiene programming as a component of the Mission’s Integrated Health Project; and 2) investing in stand-alone drinking water, sanitation, and hygiene programming through UNICEF. Specific interventions focus on direct service, behavior change, and policy implementation. The portfolio themes include strengthening water sector governance and advancing gender empowerment. Additional U.S. government activities in the DRC include USAID/Food for Peace’s Development Food Assistance Program, and disease outbreak response, including for Ebola and cholera.

Donors provide nearly 99 percent of water sector financing in the DRC, and USAID coordinates closely with these other development partners to ensure effective and efficient programming. Donor coordination focuses on water infrastructure, resource management, governance, and water treatment to leverage resources and avoid duplication of effort.

Overall, USAID and other U.S. government activities are estimated to provide the Congolese with millions of liters of safe drinking water, and to help more than one million people gain access to basic water and sanitation services.","The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), the second largest country in Africa, is endowed with large quantities of freshwater.

Millions of people live in extreme poverty, and do not have access to clean drinking water. Here are 3 important facts about water quality in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

1. Weak Infrastructure

Fifty million people, or 75 percent, of the entire population lack access to safe drinking water, despite the fact that the country holds over half of the continent of Africa’s water reserves. While resources are available, the country has a weak infrastructure, a lack of effective policies, and limited paved roads and electricity, which limits their ability to utilize clean water sources.

2. Price and Time

There are few sources of clean water, particularly in more rural areas; yet, many water pumps cost villagers a monthly maintenance fee. Although the cost is inexpensive, many individuals are unable to pay. Not only is cost a factor, but time is as well — at many water pumps, it takes individuals up to two hours to get clean water. The price coupled with how long the process takes discourages individuals, and leads them to the more inexpensive and convenient unsafe water sources instead.

3. Heightened risk of disease and illness

Due to the price and sometimes distance of clean water sources from villages, many individuals choose to drink from unsafe water sources. This in turn, places individuals, particularly children at risk for disease and illness. The poor water quality in the Democratic Republic of Congo, has led to the country having one of the highest child mortality rates in the world. A child in a rural Congolese village is four times more likely to drink contaminated water than someone living in a town or city; there’s also more than two million children under five are frequently sick with diarrhea.

4. Solutions

While poor water quality in the Democratic Republic of Congo proves to be a serious issue, the number of people who have access to clean water has risen by over 3 percent in the last several decades. The government of the DRC has also managed to reverse the negative trend of poor water quality and water coverage since peace was achieved in 2003, and many experts think this effort should be applauded.

Infrastructure improvements within the government coupled with investments to improve the water quality can make all the difference for the livelihood and wellbeing of millions of Congolese.

Water quality in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is in need of improvement. Only 46 percent of the population has access to clean and safe drinking water. Although the DRC has an abundance of freshwater sources, pollution and accessibility are major issues in the country.

According to the World Food Programme, the DRC is one of the poorest countries in the world. Therefore, the country has a lack of infrastructure and insufficient water storage and treatment facilities. Poorly maintained water systems can be dangerous because old and rusted pipes can possibly pollute water. Some towns, especially in rural regions, do not have any water systems.

For instance, the isolated town of Kasongo once had a working water system but it broke down and was not been repaired for several years. Without running water, residents had to walk three miles to get water from the nearest stream. This trip can take up to two hours. This is common for rural towns in the Congo.

People in the rural regions who depend on direct water sources are more likely to drink unsafe water. Approximately 37 million people in rural areas are at risk of contracting a disease from contaminated streams and rivers. One of the most common illnesses caused by unsafe drinking water is Cholera. Every year, 20,000 people die from cholera.

UNICEF representative, Pierette Vu Thi says, “A child living in a Congolese village is four times more likely to drink contaminated water than someone in town. Yet, all children have equal right to survival and development of which drinking water is a vital component.”

There are many solutions being explored to improve water access and quality in the Congo. The state water company REGIDESO is tapping groundwater in order to install pumps in remote rural areas. This method is much cheaper and less difficult than installing water systems. But, old water systems are also being restored. In Kasongo, REGIDESO replaced their defunct water system. The old storage tank, engine and pump were repaired with new models. A network of pipes and taps were extended to provide more people with running water.

The water quality in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is poor especially for the Congolese in rural areas. However, with new initiatives, many more people will gain access to clean water without having to travel miles.

A number of health districts in these cities have been benefiting for the past few weeks from abundant drinking water to effectively combat “dirty hand diseases” and epidemics, particularly Ebola and Covid-19.

The international NGO Mercy Corps, an organization that works in partnership with communities, businesses and governments to transform the lives of people around the world, recently provided the health areas with 15 boreholes, two water supply systems and drinking water sources. The facilities were installed by the National Rural Hydraulic Service. They provide up to 4 m³ of water per hour.

The manual pumps in the health areas have also been renovated

Drinking water projects are a response to community demand. “During this Ebola period, the inhabitants of several neighbourhoods organised themselves into community outreach teams to reflect on the nature of the responses that need to be capitalised on to defeat the epidemic. Based on the needs expressed through the action plans implemented by these cells, we found that the need for drinking water was common to all neighbourhoods. We therefore decided to support communities by installing drinking water sources. Once they have water, they can practise good hygiene and prevent dirty hand disease and epidemics,” says Guillaume Cailleaux, the deputy director of the Ebola programme at Mercy Corps.

For decades, the people of Butembo have faced the problem of a shortage of drinking water. A situation that has already caused the death of hundreds of people.

The President of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) Félix-Antoine Tshisekedi recently laid the foundation stone for the construction of an “industrial water treatment complex” in the capital. This is an important project that could reduce the shortage of drinking water in this city of almost 12 million inhabitants.

The project has been awarded to Weihai International Economic & Technical Cooperative (WIETC), a company based in Weihai, north-eastern China. The drinking water plant that will come out of the ground in Kinshasa will be supplied by water from the Congo River.

A large drinking water plant

As part of its contract, WIETC will construct an intake in the Congo River that flows through the capital of the DRC. The raw water will be conveyed to the plant via an 805 mm diameter pipe and over a distance of 3 km, via Colonel Tshatshi camp. This is a military camp located in Ngaliema, a commune west of Kinshasa City.

The (raw) water will pass through an arrival tower before entering the drinking water plant. The plant will have a capacity of 110,000 cubic metres per day. WIETC will also construct a building that will serve as a storage facility for water treatment chemicals. The Chinese company has 23 months to complete all the work.

Financing from the World Bank

The construction of this drinking water plant in Kinshasa is part of the Urban Drinking Water Supply Project (Pemu) in the DRC. The aim of the project is to increase sustainable access to water in selected urban areas and improve the efficiency of the Democratic Republic of Congo’s water distribution company (Regideso). Pemu concerns three cities in the DRC: the capital Kinshasa, Lubumbashi in the south and Matadi in the west.

In Kinshasa, the project will rehabilitate the existing pumping stations in the city and reinforce the water transfer pipe from the N’djili plant over a distance of 18 km. The government of the DR Congo also plans to rehabilitate 120 km of secondary and tertiary pipelines. This operation will enable new connections to be made. Regideso, which provides the DRC’s public drinking water service, will replace 160 000 metres and install 50 000 new ones in the city of Kinshasa. Projects will also be carried out in the cities of Lubumbashi and Matadi.

Pemu will require an overall investment of $360 million. Within this budget, $59.4 million is earmarked for the construction of the “industrial water treatment complex”. The government is financing the project with a loan from the World Bank.

This is the time frame that has been left to the Pan China company to complete the drinking water project that has just been launched in the capital of the eastern Kasai province by Sylvestre Ilunga Ilunkamba, the Prime Minister of the Democratic Republic of Congo.

The project will result in the rehabilitation of the city’s water pumping station. The Chinese company will also extend the distribution network of the Democratic Republic of Congo’s water distribution company (Regideso). Several water towers will also be erected, each with a capacity of 1,500 m³. Several administrative and metering buildings will be constructed as part of the drinking water project.

Finally, in several districts of the town of Mbuji-Mayi, 865 standpipes will be installed for the distribution of drinking water to the population. Congolese Prime Minister Sylvestre Ilunga Ilunkamba estimates that the project will benefit 60% of the population of Mbuji-Mayi. The capital of Kasai Oriental has a population of more than 3.3 million people.

The government’s new project is expected to cost no less than $26.2 million. This investment is far from sufficient to solve the city’s water problems on a sustainable basis. At the beginning of the second half of 2019, the situation was such that, in order to get by on a daily basis, people were forced to use water from the rivers that cross Mbuji-Mayi. A situation that is very regularly at the origin of the resurgence of certain water-borne diseases such as cholera in Kasai.

The DRC wants to make it a continental concern. The President of this Central African country, Félix Antoine Tshisekedi, himself presented the challenges of the project during the opening ceremony by videoconference of the “Pan-African Conference on the Grand Inga” on June 22, 2020.

“With an estimated capacity of 44,000 megawatts, the Grand Inga project will be able to meet a significant share – up to 40% – of Africa’s electricity demand at a competitive price and in a sustainable manner,” said President Félix Antoine Tshisekedi. The first phase of this conference, which is much more like an advocacy, a raising of political will around the Grand Inga project, is devoted to experts. They will exchange for a week around the feasibility of the project, and prepare the analysis files for the African Heads of State, who will meet during the second phase of the conference, scheduled for September or October 2020, depending on the evolution of the health crisis due to the coronavirus.

The second phase of the conference is indeed the most crucial. It is designed to win regional political support for the DRC’s hydropower projects, particularly the Grand Inga project, which is seen as an important anchor for solving Africa’s electricity shortages, developing green energy production and the continental African electricity market.

Grand Inga, a first-class project

Congo has a hydroelectric potential of 110,000 MW. It is the largest in Africa, and the government intends to use it primarily to boost the country’s economic development. This is why an agency dedicated to the development and promotion of the dam project (dubbed ADPI in French) was created within the Office of the Head of State and placed under his direct authority.

Through the work of the ADPI and with the assistance of the DRC Ministry in charge of water resources, the Democratic Republic of Congo, with the support of the African Development Bank (AfDB), has made progress in the technical, commercial and environmental preparation of the project and in the selection process of developers, which has led to numerous expressions of interest to purchase electricity from the Grand Inga project.

12,https://www.afrik21.africa/en/drc-heavy-flooding-ravage-the-east/,DRC: Heavy flooding ravage the east,"The populations of South Kivu and Ituri experienced nightmarish scenes in the night of Friday to Saturday May 2, 2020. Heavy rains fell on these provinces located in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo, causing the overflow of two large bodies of water: Lake Albert on the border between the Democratic Republic of Congo and Uganda, and Lake Tanganyika at the intersection of DRC, Burundi, Rwanda, Tanzania and Zambia.

The waters of these lakes have raged on the surrounding land, causing serious human and material damage. In South Kivu, the director of the Diocesan Caritas of Uvira, a development support agency of the Catholic Church, made a provisional assessment. The floods have caused more than 52 deaths and led to the evacuation of more than 100,000 displaced people. The city was cut off from the rest of the country as the two bridges linking the urban centre were washed away. “There is a lack of safe drinking water, sanitation has been compromised and there is a real danger of diseases, such as cholera, transmitted through contaminated water. Food, medicine, first aid kits, household utensils and mosquito nets are needed,” said Father Dominic Mulumeoderhwa.

In Ituri province, local people have counted about 100 houses washed away by the waters of Lake Albert.

In 2019, about 265 people had perished in the floods in East Africa.

The DRC, which borders East Africa, is also a victim of the floods that have become customary in the Great Lakes region. The last major floods were recorded in this Central African country in October 2019. They had left more than 36,000 people, including 24,000 children, in distress in the northern region of South Ubangui. In neighbouring East Africa, at least 265 people died within two months as a result of flooding, mudslides and landslides.

These disasters tend to confirm the predictions of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and the repercussions of a global warming of more than 1.5°C in sub-Saharan Africa. According to the world’s leading scientific authority on the assessment of scientific data on climate change, the rise in temperatures in the region is expected to be greater than the global average rise, and would result, among other things, in violent flooding.

13,https://www.afrik21.africa/en/drc-afdb-provides-73-million-for-grand-inga-dam-feasibility-studies/,DRC: AfDB provides $73 million for Grand Inga Dam feasibility studies,"The President of the African Development Bank (AfDB) Group, Akinwumi Adesina, recently completed a working visit to the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). During this trip, he visited the Grand Inga hydroelectric project site, about 30 kilometres from the town of Matadi, in the Bas-Congo province, in the southwest of the country.

Akinwumi Adesina took the opportunity to announce that the AfDB would finance feasibility studies for the future hydroelectric dam with a total of US$ 73 million. “Inga means “yes” in the local language, the AfDB also says yes for the support of this much-awaited project for the industrialisation of Africa,” Akinwumi Adesina added. This is a first step in the development of this project, which would produce 11,000 MW of electricity.

A mega project worth more than $18 billion

According to the AfDB President, the successful implementation of the huge Grand Inga hydroelectric project will require a “clear vision from the Congolese government, a personal commitment from the Head of State and support from regional institutions, including the AfDB”.

AfDB financing is the second strong signal since the project was relaunched in 2013. The first took place in 2018 with the selection of the consortium responsible for the design, financing and construction of the large dam. These are the Spanish company Actividades de Construcción y Servicios (ACS), as well as the Chinese companies China Three Gorges Corporation (CTG) and Sinohydro. They are currently putting in place a financing plan that they should then forward to the Congolese authorities.

After this step, companies will be able to design and build the Grand Inga Hydroelectric Dam, which is expected to cost $18 billion, or one third of DRC’s annual budget. The dam will be built upstream of the Nkokolo intake. The water retention will be 200 m high. Environmentalists are already sounding the alarm that thousands of hectares of forest could be flooded because of the dam.

In fact, a coalition of 32 Congolese civil society organisations involved in environmental protection said they tried unsuccessfully to meet with the AfDB President during his visit to the DRC. The Commission wanted to draw the attention of the financial institution’s officials to the risks associated with the project. “The high social and environmental risks of the Grand Inga project are evident. We, the communities affected by Inga I and II, have been struggling for decades to obtain fair compensation, and continue to suffer the economic and cultural consequences of the loss of our lands. Many households are at risk of being displaced again by the Grand Inga project,” said Albert Tona, a member of the Inga community.

The Grand Inga Dam project

The Grand Inga project is estimated to produce 40000MW of power. This is enough to provide power to nearly half of the continent. It has been proposed for over 10 years but lack of political will and possible corruption has prevented the project from reaching its full potential.

Since 1972, only phase one and phase two in 1982, of the project have been in existence and operational. Together they generate almost 1800MW. The grand Inga is suggested to be constructed in six phases. Inga three will be the first phase in the project. An agreement was signed between South Africa, Namibia, Botswana and Angola with DRC, about 10 years ago in order to develop the Inga three project and provide transmission of the power it produces through the Western corridor.

Approximately Inga three was to cost about US $14bn. However in 2013, a side deal by South Africa and the DRC sidelined the rest of the Southern African countries which led to an interruption of the project. However the meeting held at the African Union Extraordinary summit gave some little hope that the project could be revived.

The Grand Inga Dam is the world’s largest suggested hydropower scheme. It is the cornerstone of a grand vision to help a continent-wide power system. It is predicted that about US $80bn could be enough to develop the project. This will include placing of transmission lines across the continent.","Construction works on the US $14bn Grand Inga Dam hydroelectric project in the Democratic Republic of Congo is on track.

Speaking during the launch of the project, President Félix-Antoine Tshisekedi revealed that the contract has been awarded to Weihai International Economic & Technical Cooperative (WIETC), a company based in Weihai, north-eastern China.

Terms of the contract

As per the contract, WIETC is supposed to construct a drinking water plant with a capacity of 110,000 cubic meters a day plus an intake in the Congo River that flows through the capital of the DRC.

The raw water will be delivered to the plant through an 805mm diameter pipe and over a distance of 3km, via Colonel Tshatshi camp, a military camp located in Ngaliema, west of Kinshasa City. WIETC will also construct a building that will serve as a storage facility for water treatment chemicals.

The entire project is financed by the government through a loan worth US $59.4m from the World Bank, and it is planned to be completed within 23 months.

The Urban Drinking Water Supply Project

The industrial water treatment complex project is part of the Urban Drinking Water Supply Project (Pemu) which aims to increase sustainable access to water in the cities of Kinshasa, Lubumbashi and Matadi while improving the efficiency of Regideso, DRCs’ public water distribution company.

In Kinshasa, Pemu will see the rehabilitation of the existing pumping stations in the city and reinforcement of the water transfer pipe from the N’djili plant over a distance of 18km. Furthermore, the project advocates for the rehabilitation of 120km of secondary and tertiary pipelines, an operation that will enable new connections to be made. The above-mentioned work plus that in Lubumbashi and Matadi cities will require an overall investment of US $360m.","The Democratic Republic of the Congo has begun the construction of an industrial water treatment complex in Kinshasa, the Central African country capital city.

16,https://www.unenvironment.org/news-and-stories/story/unep-launches-pioneering-water-initiative-drc-protect-supply-safe-water,UNEP launches pioneering water initiative in DRC to protect the supply of safe water to Kinshasa,"Kinshasa/Geneva – UNEP has initiated a water scheme in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) that aims to protect the Lukaya river basin that supplies almost 380,000 Kinshasa residents with safe drinking water.

The project builds on the recommendations of UNEP’s Post Conflict Environmental Assessment (PCEA) of the DRC – the full version of which was made available online in November 2012 - that identified 13 major “hot spots” of environmental degradation in and around urban centers in the country. Much of the environmental pressure is due to rapid population growth and unplanned development in urban areas that are also extremely poor and have inadequate basic infrastructure and local services.

The innovation of the pilot project – that will implement a practice called Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) – lies in the fact that it is the communities themselves who will lead the dialogue and coordination process, assess and reconcile water needs and set the priorities for effective water management accordingly. State and local authorities will also be engaged to help build capacity and disseminate the experience in other parts of the country.

Indeed, one of the Millennium Development Goals is to halve, by 2015, the proportion of the population without sustainable access to safe drinking water.

A key concern in Lukaya is that the state-run water treatment plant needs to protect the drinking water it provides to Kinshasa residents, but the activities of local enterprises such as farms (poultry, fish and agriculture), and sand and gravel quarries in the 350km2 area have a major impact on water quality. The IWRM process creates a platform for communities and private entrepreneurs to decide on water priorities and implement practical measures to protect the water supply, which in this case comes from the Lukaya River. Practical actions can include planting buffer zones and silt traps along the river and near the water treatment plant to improve water quality by reducing sedimentation and mitigate flood risks, in addition to more effective use and management of land to protect the water supply.

The aim is to expand this pioneering project, funded jointly by the European Union and the United Nations to other parts of DRC, specifically in the Kivus and Katanga provinces. Investments needed are expected to be upscaled to circa US$10 million over a five-year period.

UNEP partners in DRC with the Ministry of the Environment, the state-owned public water company REGIDESO and local associations. On a regional level UNEP works with the river basin organization CICOS (the International Commission for the Congo-Oubangui-Sanga Basin).

This project is part of UNEP’s DRC Country Programme which was officially endorsed by the DRC Ministry of Environment in October 2012.

Notes to Editors

The PCEA focuses on the most urgent environmental and natural resource management issues confronting DRC, including the links between conflict and natural resources, the environmental impacts of population displacement, forestry resources, protected areas, water resources, fisheries, climate change, mining and environmental governance.

“I’ve to walk down this hill every day to fetch water from this spring,” she says. “Well, to be honest, we’re experiencing the worst suffering of our life.”

She’s not alone. In Madula, the administrative center of Bakumu Mandobe sector located about 23 kilometers (14 miles) from Kisangani, all of the roughly 40,000 residents are looking for water sources. Many of them wind up spending hours each day walking to and from a spring, lugging water to their homes or businesses.

Now, at the height of the rainy season, trails to the spring are muddy and slick, making the chore even more difficult.

“It’s unbearable,” Ekili says.

Zita Amwanga, GPJ DRC Women haul jerry cans to and from the spring. The community’s officials say it would cost $9,000 to develop another clean water source.

Kisangani, a city in DRC’s central region, and its environs are growing rapidly. The city’s population doubled between 2000 and 2018, going from nearly 590,000 to 1.1 million. The city is projected to hit 1.9 million people by 2030.

Madula is growing too, but the only drinking water source for its increasing population is the spring where Ekili goes, which was developed by a program called Village Assaini in 2015. (Before that, people in the area used non-treated well water.) Ironically, the spring is located just a few miles from the Régie de Distribution d’Eau, DRC’s public sector water distribution company.

A single spring usually serves about 500 households, says Richard Florentine Azelito Payo-Saka, a provincial inspector of rural development. Developing a spring can cost $9,000, he says.

The national government must either develop more natural springs or drill boreholes, says Pierre Bondo Bin-Amundala, who leads the Madula sector. Members of parliament must make it a priority, he says.

Ekili’s only other option is to pay someone to supply water to her house at a rate of 2,000 Congolese francs ($1.23).

“That’s no mean feat, because I’m a dead broke widow,” she says.

Zita Amwanga, GPJ DRC Some local people have made hauling water a business, but many can’t afford to pay even a small fee to get it delivered. Instead, this spring has become a major meeting point for the Madula community.

Love Ngomba, who operates an informal restaurant in Madula, says she spends between 3,000 and 4,000 Congolese francs ($1.84 and $2.45) each day to pay people to bring her water. It’s necessary for her business to run.

“I get water without too much trouble,” she says.

The situation has indeed created a job opportunity for people looking for work.

Jean Bangala earns money by fetching water for people like Ngomba. “I can’t help but rejoice because it helps me make some money and support my family,” he says. “You know, everything happens for a reason, because with water shortages, I can afford to eke out a living.”

Around the world, clean drinking water is a matter of life and death. In DRC, these life-and-death circumstances are exacerbated by other risks: violence, conflict and weak infrastructure that further threaten the most vulnerable. That includes children under the age of 5. Lack of access to clean water, sanitation facilities and hygiene practices are the main causes of diarrhea, which is the second most common cause of mortality for young children there. We’re working directly in communities to help change that. And women like Noella, pictured above, are instrumental in making that change. Water challenges in DRC Long-standing insecurity and violence in DRC are forcing desperate people from their homes in search of peace. Families are fleeing their traditional rural and farming areas for towns and cities where they feel safer. Around 4.5 million people are displaced within the country. This past year, the violent situation has only worsened. This increased level of displacement — coupled with mismanagement and lack of funding for water for more people — has led to a shortage of clean water in Goma and Bukavu in eastern DRC. In many places, when water isn’t available, it often takes hours of walking to reach a water source. And there are no guarantees that it’s clean. When water is available locally, long lines to reach the taps or wells are likely. That’s why we’re there, in the communities that need us most, improving access to and education about water for the most vulnerable citizens of Goma and Bukavu. Improving the health of communities in DRC

Groups of about 15 women meet all over Goma in DRC to discuss how to keep their children healthy. Noella leads this one. ALL PHOTOS: Elizabeth Dalziel for Mercy Corps

Noella, a social mobilizer volunteer for Mercy Corps and mother of three, is working in Goma to provide that water education. She’s been volunteering with us for two years to reduce the number of deaths of children under the age of 5. “[Mercy Corps training] is very important because I have seen some changes in my family in the past year,” she says. “Through the Mercy Corps training, we know how to treat water and how to get clean water. And we know different ways of keeping the place clean and we have seen some changes in the way children were easily getting affected or falling sick. Since I’m getting that training I’ve seen a reduction in the sickness of children.” In 2016, when she started, there were more than 343 cases of children suffering from diarrhea and about 22 deaths among them. Since then, with the work of care groups like hers, the diarrhea rate in children under the age of 5 has been reduced from 10 percent in 2017 to an impressive 2 percent in July of this year. Each volunteer who is part of Noella’s group has another 15 women that they share their learnings with. There are approximately 3,200 volunteers in Goma and each person has 15 people in their group, totalling approximately 45,000 women across Goma.

Noella fetches water at a pump that Mercy Corps installed near her home in Goma.

“All the lessons that you've been teaching us are very important, [like] how you've taught us to wash [our] hands before starting activities like cooking,” says Banyere to Noella, who has been teaching her. “The lessons that you have been teaching us [are] bringing us peace because if there is an outbreak of cholera, if we're following the teaching of Mercy Corps we [won’t] be affected with the cholera.” Noella showed us some of the hygiene methods she learned from our trainings, which she now shares with others: using a water container with a lid, using soap, washing plates and putting clean dishes in a new basket, discouraging using a cloth to dry dishes, and using three buckets for washing and rinsing.

Noella also visited a clinic for children with malnutrition and participates in other social mobilization activities with volunteers and local Mercy Corps team members, like showing educational films to other community members. These activities reach additional people, mostly pregnant women and women with children under 5, who do not participate directly in Mercy Corps’ women’s groups. “[It’s important] to learn and share with our neighbors in regards to protecting our children who are under 5 years,” says Zawadi Cecile, 36, another program participant. “It is important so that they do not fall sick because of the stress it causes, and it costs additional money.” And that’s the value of empowering people directly affected by crises. Noella may be just one volunteer, but she is part of a larger movement that’s making waves across her community. How you can help

The project aims to ensure that doctors, nurses, staff, and patients – both those with COVID-19 and people seeking treatment for other maladies – have access to water, sanitation, and hygiene at health facilities. All too often, WASH services are lacking even in these places where people go to seek treatment. Available data for the DRC shows that at least half of health facilities lacked basic water or sanitation. During an infectious disease outbreak, ensuring these facilities have a reliable and safe water supply as well as soap allows medical professionals to provide care safely while also protecting their own well-being.

Existing projects are also being leveraged for the pandemic response. These include the DRC Urban Water Supply Project, which is helping increase sustainable access to drinking water in three urban centers. It now includes financing for 20 new shared water points in densely populated areas that currently lack access. Large water storage containers are being supplied by tanker trucks, which the utility already owns.

This approach provides an effective and efficient way to reach a large number of people. The infrastructure it sets up will remain in place, so that once networks extend to these areas, the existing standpipes can easily be connected. Dozens of new handwashing stations in public locations such as markets and large intersections will also be financed.

A communications campaign is underway to ensure that people across the DRC know about the importance of handwashing and physical distancing. Television and radio announcements as well as social media and messaging platforms – such as Facebook, Twitter, and WhatsApp – will spread the word, with news and guidance from the WHO and others. Community networks – vital elements of social fabric – are supporting these efforts to help ensure that nobody is left out. Their leaders can be powerful advocates within their communities, and are adding their voices to those of religious leaders, artists and sportspeople already mobilizing around this issue.

In recent years, Ebola spread across communities in DRC that were already beset by the severe hardships of extreme poverty and insecurity. Lessons from these outbreaks are informing the response to COVID-19. The government has mobilized quickly, with the Ministry of Health sharing information via SMS and producing a frequently updated tracker, so that the number of cases and hotspots could be captured and shared.

The World Bank and the DRC government are working with development partners including ENABEL (the Belgian Development Agency), UNICEF, and Oxfam, all of whom have years of experience of providing WASH in emergencies. Leveraging each other’s strengths and coordinating closely ensures that resources are better targeted and service delivery is more effective. Additional investments will also be made to fund further work with Oxfam.

Because the new SPRP is tackling a pandemic unlike anything in living memory, it is adopting the principles of adaptive management – responding in real time to changes in the operating environment. This iterative approach, constantly attuned and adjusting to new information and feedback, will be a core part of delivery.

The World Bank’s multidonor trust fund, the Global Water Security & Sanitation Partnership (GWSP), has also helped shape the Bank’s rapid response through the SPRP, both through its knowledge briefs and its WASH Poverty Diagnostic for DRC. The diagnostic shows how the lack of WASH services has stalled the country’s human development outcomes, and it pinpoints the binding constraints to service delivery. Addressing these urgently can be the difference between life and death, during the pandemic response and for years to come.","Coupled with a lack of access to sanitation and hygiene, this is putting millions of people at greater risk of contracting the coronavirus (COVID-19).

Over 24 million people are impacted by the The United Republic of Tanzania’s water crisis; that’s almost half of the population of Tanzania.

But, it’s not just about a lack of basic access to safe water. In Tanzania today, over 43 million do not practice proper sanitation. That’s the majority of people living in the country.

Together, water access, sanitation, and hygiene are referred to as “WASH,” and Tanzania is experiencing a WASH crisis. WASH impacts not only community health, but economic status, access to education, and happiness around the world.

Although challenging, the water crisis in Tanzania doesn’t define the country. Each day, parents are working hard to provide better lives for their children, and the country as a whole has seen steady growth over the last decade.

Below are the top facts you should know about the Tanzania water crisis today and how you can help bring it to an end.

Tanzania Water Crisis 2019 Facts

1. Almost Half the Population of Tanzania is Without Basic Access to Safe Water

The Joint Monitoring Programme (“JMP”), a global database on WASH around the globe, measures water access on a scale, with basic access being safe water which can be collected in a roundtrip of 30 minutes or less. Right now, 43 percent of Tanzanians are relying on water that does not meet this standard.

Women and children traditionally bear the weight of the water problems in their communities, waking early to gather water from faraway sources and making several trips each day.

Of those women and children carrying water, data shows that they are likely gathering it from unsafe sources like rivers, canals, ponds, and unprotected structures like hand-dug wells and natural springs.

2019 Progress Update

Organizations from many levels—the national government, small charities, the United Nations, and affected communities themselves—are working to end the Tanzania water crisis.

In the year 2000, 73 percent of Tanzanians were living without basic access to safe water. The most up-to-date numbers from 2017 show that the percentage was nearly halved and continues to fall.

2. About 12 Percent of the Country is Using the Bathroom Outside

The JMP reports that 12 percent of people are practicing what’s called “open defecation,” the act of defecating in fields, forests, or along the countryside.

In these communities, human feces are washed by the rain into rivers, springs, ponds, and swamps—places where many people are gathering their drinking water. This creates an unsafe environment, especially for children.

Families that drink this water experience waterborne diseases and pay expensive fees for treatment at local clinics and hospitals.

2019 Progress Update

Since 2000, when the data was first collected by the JMP, the percentage of people practicing open defecation in Tanzania has largely remained the same.

The government and various organizations are working to improve sanitation. Some have hypothesized that the influx of refugees from the small, neighboring country of Burundi are decreasing the countries’ overall progress in this area.

Another reason could simply be the difficulty involved in changing long-held practices around sanitation in Tanzanian communities.

3. Approximately 17 Percent Have No Hand Washing Facility

The JMP regards basic hygiene access as the “availability of a handwashing facility on premises with soap and water.”

In Tanzania, 17 percent of people have no place to wash their hands. Without hand washing at critical times, like after using the bathroom and before eating, people are much more likely to become sick. Another 35 percent of the population have a hand washing facility but no reliable source of safe water or soap.

Almost half of Tanzania (47 percent) has basic access, meaning they have access to a facility with soap and water. Basic hygiene practices like hand washing are critical to maintaining health.

2019 Progress Update

Data shows that the hygiene problem in Tanzania has largely remained the same from 2012-2017, when the data was last collected.

However, in Ethiopia (also in East Africa), Lifewater’s program results show that nearly 17,000 families (since 2016) have built basic hand washing structures called “tippy-taps” at their homes so they can wash their hands at critical times in the day. That’s 100,000 people who can now prevent disease through the simple act of hand washing.

The results are replicable in neighboring Tanzania, where Lifewater plans to expand in 2020.

Help End the Tanzania Water Crisis

Lifewater will begin water access work in Tanzania’s Shinyanga district in January of 2020. But, truly solving the water crisis will be about more than constructing wells.

Solving the Tanzania water crisis means villages must adopt life-saving health practices like hand washing and using a bathroom indoors, rather than outdoors. Practices like these help keep water from becoming contaminated. To sustain the new water sources, local leaders must join water committees to ensure proper use of the new, safe water source.

Finally, every village contributes 15 percent of the cost of construction through a combination of labor, materials, and cash. Lasting change requires the participation of the entire village.

Devocatus Kamara, Lifewater’s Tanzania Country Director, said that communities in Tanzania are ready to work together to solve the water crisis.

“Lifewater’s work is coming in as a game changer in Shinyanga’s long struggle for access to safe water,” he said.

Like many poor nations around the world, Tanzania suffers from serious issues involving its people in regards to water. In a nation where one third of the country is arid to semi-arid, it is very difficult for people to find access to clean, sanitary water if they don't live near one of the three major lakes that border the country. As a result, Tanzania's ground water is the major source of water for the nation's people; however it's not always clean. Many of these ground water wells are located near or next to toxic drainage systems, which leak into the fresh ground water and contaminate it. Consequently, Tanzanians turn to surface water which contains things like bacteria or human waste; and people have no choice but to drink from, bathe in or wash their clothes in these areas. According to Tanzania National Website, water-borne illnesses, such as malaria and cholera ""account for over half of the diseases affecting the population,"" because people don't have access to sanitary options.

Diseases stemming from contaminated water aren't the only problem plaguing Tanzanian society. In a household where money is scarce and daughters and mothers have to spend several hours each day walking to get water from pumps, they run the risk of being attacked or raped. TGNP, Tanzanian Gender Networking Program, found in a study of poor households ""that the lack of safe, sufficient, and affordable water in Tanzania had increased rates of gender-based violence and the number of girls dropping out of school."" Families who don't have money for water, let alone school, have no choice but to send their daughters out to collect water, possibly resulting in these episodes of violence. Unfortunately, the choices of these families are limited, they need water to survive.

As severe as the situation was, Tanzania's government attempted many times to fix it, with no avail. They understood the desperate need for water in poor areas of the country, so in 1971 the government instituted a 20 year Rural Water Supply Program. This program aimed to provide ""access to adequate, safe, dependable water supply within a walking distance of 400 meters from each household"" (The Reform of Water Sector in Tanzania). Under this program, the government also wanted to provide free water to its citizens, because water is a basic human right. However, as positive and hopeful as this program was, it failed to deliver because of issues with beneficiaries, technology, and its approach. In 1991, the government tried to implement the National Water Policy, which too needed to be revised and ultimately failed.

In 2003, when Tanzania had tried and was unsuccessful at fixing its water crisis, they came under pressure from the World Bank to privatize their water or not be given international aid and funding. So in 2003 a British corporation called Biwater came into the country and took over their water system. However, Tanzania's water problems only continued to get worse with Biwater in charge. Women were still being attacked when gathering water, because they still needed to walk long distances to access a pump. Additionally, people were still dying from water borne illnesses, and cities were still without any access to sanitary water. As a result, in 2005 the Tanzanian government took Biwater to court in London for breach of contract. They won the case and Biwater had to pay $7 million in damages to Tanzania.

In Tanzania today, the water situation is not fixed nor nearly perfect, but the government and the people know how important it is to have access to sanitary options and continue to work towards that goal.

Titled “Reaching for the SDGs: The Untapped Potential of Tanzania’s Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene Sector,” the report notes that SDG-6 challenges countries to reach universal access to safely managed water and sanitation by 2030; while its six targets are inextricably linked with other targets including ending extreme poverty, ending forms of malnutrition, and reducing infant mortality.

While Tanzania has achieved significant growth, averaging 6.5 percent over the past decade, with a modest reduction in poverty from 34 percent to 28 percent (2007-2012), it lags in expanding and sustaining basic WASH coverage. More than 23 million citizens retrieve drinking water from unimproved sources, and 41 million people use unimproved sanitation facilities.

“Adequate WASH is a crucial component of basic human necessities that allow a person to thrive in life,” said Bella Bird, World Bank Country Director for Tanzania, Malawi, Somalia and Burundi. “Outbreaks of cholera and other waterborne illnesses do not only overburden health systems and increase premature deaths, they do also leave a negative mark on the individual’s social mobility, health, quality of life, and their human capital. We are pleased to be a partner with the Government - our current and forthcoming water and sanitation programs will help advance the WASH agenda.”

The Tanzania WASH Poverty Diagnostic is part of a multi-partner Global WASH Poverty Diagnostic initiative being implemented in 18 countries across regions. Its objectives are to highlight the priority gaps in WASH access; identify those regions and population groups that are most deprived of higher-quality WASH services; demonstrate how investment in WASH can aid poverty reduction and human development strategies; and identify the major institutional constraints that hold back effective WASH service delivery.

The recommendations from the diagnostic for Tanzania include:

Integrating the SDG framework into poverty-reduction strategies and water and sanitation programmatic approaches such as Water Sector Development Program II;

Making further investment in rural water and sanitation and ‘celebrating maintenance’ to enhance sustainability in the future;

Addressing utility inefficiencies, the growth in dependence on informal private providers, and the need for expanded regulation;

Formulating more coherent policy, more clearly define and assign responsibilities for sanitation, and identify sanitation champions;

Adopting, in urban areas, citywide sanitation approaches that recognize that different solutions are suitable in different contexts;

Designing WASH interventions with a ‘nutrition-sensitive’ lens and seek to integrate WASH into multi-sectoral strategies addressing education, health, and nutrition outcomes.

Facilitating efficient, transparent, and predictable financial flows between water and sanitation services actors—from donor, to government, to community—to promote sustainable governance.

“As Tanzania seeks to achieve the ambitious SDG targets, it is more important than ever to assess the current state of WASH service delivery to inform evidence-based strategies that target gaps in service delivery,” said George Joseph, World Bank Senior Economist, who co-authored the report. “The country needs to see the new SDG era as a good opportunity to move its WASH agenda forward ambitiously to improve human development and eradicate poverty.”","DAR ES SALAAM, March 20, 2018 – Tanzania will need to invest more in water supply, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) if it is to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), improve human development outcomes, and accelerate poverty reduction, according to a new WASH Poverty Diagnostic published by the World Bank.

Water

Tanzania’s water resources are numerous and diverse with an average of 96.27 km3 of renewable water resources per year which corresponds to 2,266 m3 per person per year.

Water Resources in Tanzania are made of rivers, lakes, wetlands, and aquifers. Many of its largest water bodies are shared with neighboring countries and the subtropical climate results in high temporal variability in rainfall and river flow.

Tanzania is divided into nine river basins: Pangani, Wami-Ruvu, Rufiji, Ruvuma, Lake Nyasa, Internal Drainage Basin, Lakes Rukwa, Lake Tanganyika, and Lake Victoria, and shares eleven international lakes and rivers with other nations including the three East African Great Lakes of Victoria, Tanganyika, and Nyasa.

Despite its numerous water bodies, Tanzania faces water shortages in many areas: the distribution of water availability and population is uneven across the country and presents considerable water resource management challenges.

The general trend is that river flows and lake levels are declining. This is reported to be caused by a range of both natural and manmade factors such as declining rainfalls, unsustainable water uses such as operational rules at hydropower plants, over-abstraction of rivers, and unsustainable agricultural expansion.

Tanzania must meet and balance the increasing water demands from a broad range of pressures: a growing population, with water needed for food security, economic growth, and energy production.

Tanzania Water Sector Management

The Tanzanian water sector is divided into two sub-sectors: water resources and sanitation.

The provision of water supply and sanitation services is carried out by the Water Supply and Sanitation Authorities (WSSAs) which are responsible for the management of water supply and sanitation services mostly in urban areas, and the Community Owned Water Supply Organisations (COWSOs) in rural areas.

WSSAs is regulated by the Energy and Water Utilities Regulatory Authority (EWURA), while COWSOs are regulated by the Ministry of Water.

The Dar es Salaam Water and Sewerage Authority (DAWASA) and the Dar es Salaam Water and Sewerage Corporation (DAWASCO) are responsible for the provision of water supply services in Dar es Salaam city and neighboring areas of Kibaha and Bagamoyo.

DAWASA is the asset owner while DAWASCO is the operator for water supply services.

Regional and District WSSAs are responsible for the provision of water services in the Regional and District Headquarters, respectively, while Small Towns WSSAs serve the designated small towns.

On the other hand, National Projects Water Supply and Sanitation Authorities are the big water schemes that cover more than one Local Government Authorities and serve both urban and rural settlements.

About 60% of Tanzania’s population is estimated to have access to an improved water source. Most of the unmet need is located in small towns and rural communities where broken infrastructure, unmetered water points, and water rationing is commonplace.

Tanzania Water Quality

During 2013/14, water quality test results reported by regional WSSAs through the MajIs Water Utilities Information Syste showed that compliance to E-Coli standards was 84% while compliance with residual chlorine requirements was 86%.

For DAWASCO, compliance with E-Coli requirements was 73% while compliance with residual chlorine requirements was 82%.

Tanzania Wastewater Quality

A total of 10 out of the 23 regional WSSAs have sewerage systems. Data reported by these regional WSSAs reveal that compliance with Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD5) and Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) requirements is 72% and 71%, respectively.

Wastewater effluent from the infrastructure operated by DAWASCO does not comply with BOD5 and COD standards.

DAWASCO’s non-compliance is mainly due to poor conditions and inadequate capacity of the wastewater treatment plants.

Tanzania Sanitation

It is estimated that about 93% of Tanzanians have access to some form of latrine, but only 3% have a flush toilet.

41,https://www.usaid.gov/tanzania/news/how-solar-power-bringing-water-rural-tanzania,How Solar Power is Bringing Water to Rural Tanzania,"Sustainable access to safe water is critical to the health and economy of rural communities in Tanzania. In the past, many communities have seen water systems fall into disrepair because of high costs and limited capacity to maintain and repair them. Solar power is creating new opportunities to provide rural Tanzanians with safe, affordable water.

In June of 2018, the Water for Development Alliance, a partnership between The Coca-Cola Foundation and USAID, collaborated with The Ohio State University’s Global Water Institute, Waterboys, WorldServe International, and their local Tanzanian partner Majitech, to deliver sustainable water access to over 70,000 rural Tanzanians. The project, WADA Tanzania: Entrepreneurship for Resilient Village Water Systems, in collaboration with the Ministry of Water, will empower communities to use solar-powered water systems to access safe water and establish maintenance and financial plans to sustain the water systems.

A year into the project, the team is making progress toward increasing access to sustainable water across the rural villages. Each village will receive a solar-powered water system and training for a private water operator, selected from the village, to run the system. The solar-powered system replaces expensive water pumps powered by either diesel fuel or electricity. The costs to run the pumps are high, and availability of either fuel or electricity can be intermittent, which limits the village’s ability to access a sufficient water supply. Working with the community to install and operate the solar-powered water systems will improve the village’s self-reliance. A more sustainable and reliable water supply can increase economic and new business opportunities. Through June 2019, the team successfully installed complete systems, including boreholes, solar-powered pumps, solar panels, and well monitors in six villages.

For each system installed, the village owns the infrastructure and receives technical training from Majitech to operate and maintain the system. Each water system includes a solar panel and a Lorentz pump. The private water operator charges a nominal fee per user for 20 liters of water to cover the system’s capital replacement and maintenance costs. The operator customizes the capacity of the pump and the position of the solar arrays based on the groundwater flow rate. In addition, sensors and data modems are installed at each well to allow for remote monitoring. This locally managed system and its financial viability ensure village ownership and self-reliance.

There are many benefits to this collaborative approach with local partners. For example, this approach allows for collaboration on maintenance and troubleshooting if there are technical issues. The sensor will indicate the amount of water pumped and can provide visibility on private water operator and the village council’s finances and profitability. Additionally, the sensors measure groundwater levels so that the government and academic team can monitor recharge rates over time.

The system and the approach to implementing it address previous failures in rural water service delivery. It combines solar-powered water systems with multi-year maintenance support while accounting for the need to sustain the system with economic stability. Together, this presents a new paradigm for village water systems that can support the health and self-reliance of rural Tanzanians.

42,https://www.usaid.gov/tanzania/news/changing-face-clean-water-supply-tanzania,Changing the face of clean water supply in Tanzania,"It’s Friday morning in Hembeti, a rural village in eastern Tanzania, and Irene Lemelo is hard at work. Members of the local community update her on their progress digging trenches for water pipes, and Lemelo answers their questions about a gravity-fed water system now under construction. When she finished her engineering degree a year ago, Lemelo never anticipated working with water projects. But after finding an internship with USAID’s Water Resources Integration Development Initiative (WARIDI), she now wants to make water the focus of her professional career.

Tanzania’s health, economy, and food security depend on sustainably managed water resources. However, water scarcity challenges are growing along with the impacts of climate change and reliable access to safe drinking water and sanitation services remains beyond the reach of many people. WARIDI addresses these challenges by promoting integrated water resources management and service delivery across multiple sectors, which improves governance and increases access to sustainable multi-use water, sanitation, and hygiene services.

The activity is taking on an ambitious effort to deliver sustainable water services to some of Tanzania’s poorest and least accessible villages. By 2021, WARIDI will construct dozens of water systems and train hundreds of local owners to operate them, bringing up to 520,000 people access to basic drinking services. The activity will also reach 750,000 people with improved sanitation services and practices as part of a national behavior change campaign. But that’s not all. WARIDI supports resilient livelihoods and strengthens local water governance and gender and social equity in water resources management.

Bringing water directly to these communities promises a significant improvement to the lives of women in the region, many of whom spend each day transporting water from distant water sources. Winrock incorporates that goal into the composition of the WARIDI team.

An untapped resource

Every year, 2,000 students graduate from Tanzanian engineering programs, only to face barriers to employment. To become registered professional engineers in the country, graduates must first gain three years of practical experience. Yet, only an estimated 800 of these students will receive enough training to qualify, the vast majority of whom are men. Recognizing this abundance of unused talent and knowledge, WARIDI bolsters construction efforts with technical expertise while also providing recent engineering graduates an opportunity to build their careers.

Lemelo was one of the first 16 young engineers to be hired as an intern by WARIDI in October 2017. She serves as a site supervisor and a community liaison between local contractors and the communities in which they work. The interns possess both the technical knowledge and linguistic and cultural background to communicate with the community and their local representatives. As a result, the interns prove invaluable in working with communities to design projects that address the community’s unique needs. Through their experience, they are learning to balance water resource sustainability with increasing demands for water-intensive private connections.

Building community relations

Just as one might ask a plumber how they fixed a broken sink, members of the community and their representatives often have questions about the water projects under construction. They might ask about gravity-fed water systems, which use gravity to transport water from a water source at a higher elevation to a tap at a lower elevation. “What is it? How does it work? Why this one? Why do we have to help with the trench excavation? Why do we have to pay water fees? Why is this taking so long?” Lemelo and the other junior engineers’ knowledge enables them to answer questions from the community, helping the community become more self-reliant and able to maintain the systems after WARIDI leaves.

The recent graduates have gained experience that will help their careers, an especially meaningful opportunity for women. While only nine percent of registered engineers in Tanzania are women, twenty-five percent of WARIDI’s original site interns are female. Lemelo is one of four site interns promoted to the position of junior engineer, three of whom are women. The promotion gives junior engineers the opportunity to obtain practical experience while increasing their responsibilities in system design, construction oversight, and community engagement.

The next generation of engineers

“These were things I only knew theoretically,” says Grace Mujuni, one of the other four junior engineers. Mujuni studied environmental engineering and knew she wanted to work in the water sector. “Water is tangible for everyone,” she says, “It affects everyone directly.” Before joining WARIDI, she had been volunteering her skills with non-governmental organizations to gain work experience. Now she’s designing cost-effective water supply systems and is on track to register as a professional engineer with Tanzania’s engineering registration board.

While developing technical expertise has been crucial, the junior engineers say the opportunity to engage with communities has been the most meaningful experience from working with WARIDI. “It contributes to the sustainability when you engage the community and create ownership of the project,” says junior engineer Allen Masasi. His experience has also convinced Masasi of the importance of gender integration in such projects. “When you specifically include women in different levels of decision-making, it makes the project more sustainable.”","Members of the local community update her on their progress digging trenches for water pipes, and Lemelo answers their questions about a gravity-fed water system now under construction.

Yet their needs are often not represented in community decision-making on water and sanitation. Even when women are members of village and water governance institutions, social norms sanction women for speaking in public and keep them from participating fully.

In the communities of Kanolo in Kilombero District and Lulanzi in Kilolo District, WARIDI assessed and documented the social norms that most inhibit women’s participation and leadership. These norms include the perception that women who speak in public are “big headed” and “proud,” and that women’s contributions complicate and lengthen community decision-making. In addition, husbands who allow their wives to speak up, especially when their wives are younger, are seen as lesser men.

Following the assessment, WARIDI trained 12 community-based facilitators on strategies to increase women’s participation in decision making. The facilitators then trained 61 community leaders (32 women and 29 men) and 168 women’s group members. The training taught participants several key skills. One, how to identify and challenge harmful gender norms which keep women from participating meaningfully in making decisions about water resources. Two, how to examine expectations of community leaders and explore models of inclusive leadership. And, finally, how to strengthen women’s public speaking skills and self-confidence.

There are signs that change is happening. In a session on gender norms and inclusive decision-making, Mzee Tuwene Gavile, a village elder, addressed the 65 assembled community members. “When a woman stands and speaks, people may be criticizing just because it’s a woman. But I think women should not be giving up as they have strong points to make which are vital in influencing decisions. What we have to do is to keep encouraging them so that they will effectively participate in discussions and influence decisions as they are very important members of the community.”

WARIDI will continue to monitor the intervention. It will also evaluate the degree to which UPWARD has helped social norms shift so that women can participate in community decision-making. This will help ensure water resources are allocated in a way that meets the needs of all members of the community.","In rural Tanzania, women and girls bear the greatest burden when water is scarce and sanitation and hygiene are poor.

45,http://tanzdevtrust.org/water-projects/,Water Projects – Tanzania Development Trust,"Below is a selection of TDT’s projects involving water, chosen to demonstrate the variety of project types.

Water Harvest and Storage – Schools

In 2017/18, TDT received generous support from the Hilden Charitable Fund, to provide water harvest and storage facilities in four secondary schools in Manyoni District, Singida Region.

These schools lacked clean water for drinking and any water for cleaning and hand washing.

TDT gave grants to the four schools – Isseke, Kinangali, Heka and Chikuyu – to build 40,000 litre concrete water storage tanks that would harvest water in the wet season from classroom roofs and store for future use. The images below show water gathering at Kinangali, and then a completed tank at Isseke.

Water Harvest and Storage – Health

TDT has assisted many health centres and dispensaries with water supplies. Here are just a couple of examples.

Mvumi School of Nursing is part of an Anglican Mission hospital that is not eligible for Government funding. A large new dormitory building was in progress, planned to double student nurse intake, but this included no water facilities. Mains water supply is cut off regularly during the dry season, and the student accommodation could not call on hospital supplies. TDT funded four 5,000-litre plastic SIM tanks, with cement bases and the necessary guttering and downpipes to enable water capture.

One of TDT’s longest-standing projects is the village of Kikukwe, where it funded the construction of a dispensary. For the original construction, Seaford Rotary paid for water harvesting and Britain-Tanzania Society members for electricity connection. In 2015, a borehole behind the dispensary was reactivated and a pump house built, sending water to a water tower for the dispensary to use. Unfortunately, the water tower was badly damaged by an earthquake in 2016. The generosity of donors to TDT’s earthquake appeal allowed TDT to provide funds for its repairs allowing the dispensary to continue provide life-saving help to the community.

The images below show the fourth tank being delivered to Mvumi, and the collapsed water tank at Kikukwe, before its repair and replacement.

Water Tanks for the Elderly

TDT has not only supported the youngest in the society, but also the eldest. In 2018, a grant was awarded for the construction of 4 water storage tanks to be installed in 4 villages in Ihembe ward, 60km from Kayanga town. The water will only be available to elderly people who are less able to walk long distances to find water, and thus are highly exposed to the issue of seasonal water supplies.

Before the construction of the water tank I could hardly afford to get enough water to drink, cook and clean my body. I took a bath only once a week. Now I can take a bath every after two days, and my granddaughter washes my clothes regularly. Please pass our thanks to that white man (Mr. Kelvin).”

The project cost of £4,000, was funded by three generous donations: two Trusts and a church.

Well Building

Below we show images of the construction of a shallow ring well at Basanza Dispensary, Uvinza District. This dispensary serves some 7,500 people. A previous water well was completely broken, and community members especially women used to walk long distances to collect water for the dispensary. At a cost of around £3,000 TDT was able to put that right. The community made a commitment to sustain the well through raising money for its maintenance.","Water Harvest and Storage – SchoolsIn 2017/18, TDT received generous support from the Hilden Charitable Fund, to provide water harvest and storage facilities in four secondary schools in Manyoni District, Singida Region.

46,https://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/blog/2020/in-tanzania--electricity-and-clean-water-comes-from-a-box.html,"In Tanzania, electricity and clean water comes from a box","“People in the villages had to walk around five kilometres every day to get water and there was absolutely no source of power,” says Peter Aron Kanyelele, who works in the Ikungi district in Tanzania’s Singida region. This is the reality for 16 percent of people in rural Tanzania who have no electricity. More than 70 percent of the country’s 57 million people do not have clean and safe water.

The UNDP-supported solar-powered Off Grid Box houses all of the hardware needed to produce electricity and clean, safe water in one shipping container.

Carbon neutral

“The box converts the sun’s rays into renewable electricity and can power commercial and local grids or it can be stored in power banks—a family kit—that can be transported to homes for later use,” says UNDP Project Manager Emmanuel Nnko. “The box can also capture rainwater and the electricity is used to filter and sterilize untreated water to provide up to 1,000 litres of drinking water per day.” The box is also carbon neutral.

Twelve Off Grid Boxes have been installed by UNDP in Tanzania in three districts of Bunda, Ikungi and Busega. They serve about 24,000 people who previously had no electricity. They’re also being used by health centres and schools, meaning, among other benefits, students can study longer.

Improving living standards

Safe, clean water will improve living standards and health. Around the world, waterborne diarrhoeal diseases, are responsible for two million deaths every year, the majority occurring in children under five.

The financial benefits are also very tangible. Before the Off Grid Boxes were installed, households were spending up to US$1.30 a day on bottled water. Now they spend between about 43 cents a week. Households that were spending 86 cents a week on kerosene for lighting now pay just 17 cents, which includes mobile phone charging.

Women, who shoulder a disproportionate responsibility for household fuel and water collection as well as food preparation, are also benefitting. “The project is changing lives as people had to walk so far to get water,” says Mr Kanyelele. “Now people do not have to waste so much time travelling, they can spend more time with their families, and they have more time to start a business.”

It is expected that the project will also stimulate a wide range of economic activity -- everything from the sale of electronic devices, to hair salons, to local cinemas, to poultry farming and crop processing.

Huge potential

And the potential for the Off Grid Boxes is huge given that the electricity generated is consumed at only 30-40 percent of their capacity. It is planned to deploy a ‘pay as you go’ business model in Tanzania, run by women entrepreneurs. Users will pay 9 cents to recharge batteries, get purified water and wi-fi. There is also potential for other community business models including the sale of the clean water generated by the box in local shops.

Tanzania’s Ministry of Health has also indicated that they are interested in deploying Off Grid Boxes to health centres throughout the country to provide a reliable source of clean, safe water and electricity to the centres.

Tackling climate change

The project will also help to address the impact of climate change, which has had a pronounced impact in the Lake Victoria region. “In the dry seasons, you have low flows in the rivers that feed into the lake, and a lot of drought. There is little water,” says hydrologist Pamela Agaba. “The negative effects of climate change disproportionately fall on marginalized and rural communities within the Lake Victoria Basin.”

“Thanks to the project, people are now much more comfortable. I hope that villages suffering from the same problems will be inspired to do the same,” says Mr Kanyelele.



The Off Grid Box project has been implemented by UNDP’s Country Office in Tanzania thanks to investment from UNDP’s Country Investment Facility. It offered UNDP County Offices the opportunity to make catalytic, innovative investments in new areas of growth and business development.","The UNDP-supported solar-powered Off Grid Box houses all of the hardware needed to produce electricity and clean, safe water in one shipping container.

This was said yesterday by the Ministry of Water in a written response to Mr Abdallah Chikota (Nanyamba CCM). The lawmaker alleged that the Makonde water scheme was facing a serious infrastructure crisis as most of its equipment was dilapidated.

""Nevertheless, the scheme is facing power interruption. Therefore, it fails to actively supply water in Nanyamba Town,"" he said querying the timeframe that the government had planned to solve the problem.

Makonde Water Authority covers 510,975 customers with demand of 766,462 cubic meters every month. Makonde's water infrastructure has now reached 275,928 people with water demand reaching 413,892 cubic metres or an equivalent of 54 percent of the total population.

Minister for Water, Prof Makame Mbarawa, said the infrastructure had the capacity to produce 482,400 cubic metres of water monthly-which is sufficient to the entire population covered by its distribution network.

According to the minister, the authority plans some investments, including those at Mitema water source and the rehabilitation of infrastructure.

He said the water source had the potential water volume unlike the rest water sources and could cover the entire population serviced by the Makonde Water Authority.

Likewise, the government disbursed 100m/- as advanced funds to implement a water supply network extension project to reach more households in Makang’wa and neighbouring villages.

While launching the project, the deputy minister directed officers under his portfolio to conduct a feasibility study for the water supply extension project and seek two water sources to end water scarcity in the area.

“Water supply network should now be extended to neighbouring villages to ensure more people have access to water supply,” said the deputy minister during the launch of the project worth 350m/-.

The project, implemented by the Dodoma Urban Water Supply and Sanitation Authority (Duwasa), will benefit over 7,000 households in Makang’wa Village and neighbouring villages in Chamwino.

Duwasa Managing Director David Pallangyo said the authority started implementing the project on September 19, 2019, saying the project had to be completed in two months up to November 18, 2019.

But he noted that the project timeframe had to be extended to 30 days due to delays of solar panels and a water pump from abroad, pointing out that construction involved the renovation of a water tank, 13 water drawing points in the village and installation of a solar panel. “The project has the capacity to produce 336,000 litres a day.

All Makang’wa villagers now have access to water supply,” he said. Mr Pallangyo said Makang’wa villagers had to travel long distances in search for water, saying they were required to pay 200/- for a 20-litre bucket to water borehole owners.

If that is the easiest way that everyone can get away with the use of hand sanitizers, then the government through experts in the health sector emphasized that every home and business area should have a special area with hand washing equipment.

The order included all public and private offices, shops, hospitals and health centers, taxi, bus and motorcycle stations; and even in markets.

To get to the outskirts of the city, the call was made to the public and private water borehole supervisors who provide the service to the community.

It was a comfort to see a positive response from water service providers who are essentially at the forefront of the battle against the spread of Covid-19. Dar-es-Salaam Water and Sewage Authority (DAWASA) services the city of Dar es Salaam and the towns of Bagamoyo, Kibaha, Mkuranga, Kisarawe and Chalinze in the Coastal Region.

DAWASA is also the project manager of all public projects run by the communities through water user associations or water committees.

The authority is also continuing with registering of private water service providers who have met all criteria, including obtaining a groundwater permit from Wami Ruvu valley and water quality.

DAWASA has been given the mandate following the adoption of the new water supply and sanitation act no.5 of 2019.

It gives DAWASA the responsibility of supervising water and sanitation services in Dar es Salaam city.

In the fight against the spread of coronavirus, water service providers were invited to DAWASA offices and were encouraged to support the government’s efforts in the war against the spread of the virus in the areas that they offer and need their services.

They were also required to have soap and know proper ways of hand-washing, for them to be able to educate customers and people they serve; The response was positive and satisfying.

In the city of Dar es Salaam with more than five million residents, have total of 75 water service providers.

They have been able to install protective gear that includes water buckets for washing hands together with soap in 241areas with crowds like bus stands, motorcycles and tricycles (bodaboda and bajaji) stands as well as in areas of fetching water.

These efforts are continuous. The chairman of one of the water associations known as Mamboleo A situated in Temeke District, Mr Ally Saidi stated that there has been a great response within the community in washing hands and protecting themselves from the spread of the virus.

“Indeed, after the government’s directives on putting protective gear in the essential areas were citizens get services, many people have received this with utmost urgency.

DAWASA also made educative visits to us on proper ways to protect ourselves through clean water services that we operate under the authority,” said Mr Saidi.

He added that as of present every facility that is under the water project has put in place a bucket of clean water and soap so that customers who come for water services wash their hands before they touch the taps.

Mr Saidi added that placing water and soap did not end at their service centers but in other numerous places with crowds as well.

The chairman of the Moringe water association located in Mbagala Kizuiani, Mr Joseph Chilala assured that they have put a system in place that guarantees all customers who come for water service wash their hands with clean running water and soap, otherwise they are not serviced.

“Right now the trick is to wash your hands with soap and running water to get service, one cannot open any tap at the service center without washing hands with soap.

We are grateful for DAWASA as they have provided us with the equipment for the fight against the spread of Covid-19 including buckets, soap, and proper education on how to use them,” he commented.

DAWASA also allowed them to connect water to the public to ensure that every citizen has access to clean water to be able to wash hands with running water. These buckets have also been placed in crowded places.

According to Mr Chilala, the act of DAWASA supporting them with equipment has strengthened their effectiveness in carrying out their duties while adhering to all protective measures against coronavirus.

Receiving services from one of the water associations, Ms Rukia Simba has commended efforts put by the water associations in ensuring the accessibility of clean water especially during such times of the spread of the virus.

She urged the water associations to take stern measures to those who will violate the protective system put in place.

“Such an initiative is very important to us who are not connected to the DAWASA water system and rely on such associations for access to a reliable supply of clean water.

This virus is very dangerous and without reliable availability of water, the situation would have worsened.”

She emphasized that no one can get near the water taps and fetch water if they have not washed their hands.

It is a good system as it protects the citizens from the virus as the government directed.

“If one wants to draw water from the taps, it’s a must to wash hands with soap before you get the service.

We appreciate DAWASA for it has simplified this by providing over 20 water buckets and soap in our kigamboni area,” she commended.

DAWASA Head of Communications and Community Unit, Neli Msuya said that water associations have been very helpful in offering water services to areas that are not connected with DAWASA water network, while they are closely supervised in the running of their daily activities.

“During this time of the fight against coronavirus, we have made efforts to ensure that these associations are at the forefront of protecting themselves and the community getting serviced by them against the spread of the virus.

We have provided them with protective equipment, as well as education on the correct way of washing hands and other precautions during this period,” he explained.

Apart from providing water services, DAWASA supervises community projects run by municipals and are managed by around 321community based water associations which are situated in different areas of Dar es Salaam","The authority is also continuing with registering of private water service providers who have met all criteria, including obtaining a groundwater permit from Wami Ruvu valley and water quality.

Burundi, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda will have the stations meant to provide real time data and more reliable information to improve water resources planning and management both at national and regional levels.

The move will enable flood and drought disaster preparedness, monitoring of surface water quality and sediment transport, coordinated management of water storage dams, navigation and improved adaptation to climate change.

Nile Basin Initiative Secretariat Knowledge Management Officer, Ms Juliet Nakasagga told the ‘Daily News’ that the NELSAP component is part of the Nile Basin Regional Hydromet project that is a basin-wide Euros 5.5 million that is funded by the European Union (EU) –Germany’s Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ).

“In the EU-BMZ funded project we will install a total of 80 hydrological stations across the Nile River basin. The project is being implemented by the three Nile Basin Initiative (NBI), centers and NELSAP is responsible for the Nile Equatorial Lakes (NEL), region,” said Ms Nakasagga.

As part of the hydrological package, each of the NEL countries will receive water level and rainfall sensors, data loggers, accessories necessary for installation and rehabilitation of selected stations, equipment for water discharge measurements and dual data transmission technology.

Each country will have the option to switch to either option for compliance with their national policy and country limitations.

National data centres will be equipped and countries will also receive a toolkit for water quality and sediment transport monitoring, accompanied with training for national staff.

Information products generated from data collected at the regional stations will be considered as final information for decision making and member states are putting in place a mechanism for sharing these.

Upon completion, the stations will be handed over to the countries for operation and maintenance.

Under the initiative, Tanzania will get eight stations at Mara River, Grumeti River, Ruvuvu River at Mumwendo Ferry, Mbarageti River, Duma River, Kagera River at Kyaka Ferry, Mara River at Kogatende and Simiyu River at Lumeiji.

As for Uganda, there will be 15 stations.

They will be at Lake Victoria at Jinja pier, River Katonga, River Kagera at Masangano, River Sio at Luhalali, River Bukora at Mutukula and Lake Kyoga at Bugondo Pier.

Others are Victoria Nile at Mbulamuti, River Malaba at Jinja, River Kyoga Nile at Masindi Port, River Kyoga Nile at Paraa, Lake Edward at Katwe, Lake Albert at Butiaba, River Semliki at Bweramule, Albert Nile at Laropi and at Panyango.

Rwanda will be supported to have seven stations at Gakindo, Gihinga, Kagitumba, Ruliba, Rusumo, Shell and Akagera Outlet.

Kenya is to have six stations at Nzoia, Yala, Nyando, Sondu Miriu, Gucha Migori and Mara. While Burundi gets two stations on Ruvubu River at Gitega and Muyinga, DRC will have a single station at the Semuliki River.

NELSAP is one of two investment programs under the NBI that is a partnership of the riparian states effective 1999.

It seeks to develop the river in a cooperative manner, share substantial socioeconomic benefits and promote regional peace and security through its shared vision.","“In the EU-BMZ funded project we will install a total of 80 hydrological stations across the Nile River basin.

The Ministry of Water assured Parliament yesterday that it was fully committed to seeing water scarcity in Morogoro Municipal Council came to an end.

Responding to Special Seats MP Devotha Minja (Chadema), Minister for Water, Prof Makame Mbarawa, said his ministry, through Morogoro Urban Water Supply and Sewage Authority (Moruwasa), was implementing an ambitious project which sought to get water from Divue River in Turiani District during the 2020/21 fiscal year via internal revenue sources.

In her question, Ms Minja said Mindu Dam in Morogoro Region was overwhelmed, asking the government when an alternative dam would be constructed.

In response, the minister said the project was expected to provide 27,000 cubic metres of water per day, thus making availability of water in the municipal council to reach 74,000 cubic metres per day above water demand of about 67,086 cubic metres per day in the municipal council.

“In the 2020/21 fiscal year, the government intends to implement another project for the expansion of a water treatment plant in Mafinga which sources water from Mindu Dam to produce 40,000 cubic metres per day and we implement this project in collaboration with French Development Agency (AFD).”

In 2017, AFD said it was targeting to provide €600m to support Tanzania’s development projects between 2017 and 2021.

Out of that money, €500m was to be spent on government projects, mainly in water and sanitation, energy and transport.

Among the implementing partners is Moruwasa, which aims at increasing drinking water production by doubling the existing capacity and securing water resources and enhancing a water distribution system with a focus on poor people.

The project also aims at serving Morogoro’s population by expanding the existing sewerage network and improving access to sanitation infrastructure.","THE government is implementing an ambitious water project in Morogoro Region to ensure there is water supply in the municipal council by 100 per cent.

That was learnt in Parliament here in CAG Charles Kichere’s tabled annual audit report for the year ending June 2019 on Monday, with further indication that despite the percentage by 2017/18, not all the 12 sampled villages visited by Local Government Authorities (LGAs) were having access to the services.

Also, there was insufficient quantity supplied in the communities because the Ministry of Water and Irrigation, and Prime Minister’s Office, Regional Administration and Local Government (PORALG) had not ensured sufficient supply to them.

The noted reason for the inadequate access to clean and safe water was lack of proper planning associated with implementation in the projects.

This resulted in some structures being constructed without ensuring that they would have reliable water, hence causing storages again.

Equally, the audit revealed that the Ministry of Water and PORALG did not ensure sufficient quantity of water supply to the communities.

“This is because; most of the water supply projects implemented in some areas within the LGAs did not yield the quantity that was expected,’’ said Mr Kichere in his report.

For instance, it was noted that out of 42 productive borehole projects implemented in the visited three Urban Water Supply and Sanitation Authorities (UWSSAs), seven (equivalent to 17per cent) yielded less than the expected quantity of water.

The CAG report further detailed that there was also insufficient quality supplied to the communities, for instance, 709 out of 6,615 boreholes sampled and analysed estimated as 10.7per cent, did not meet the recommended quality standards for domestic use.

It was found out that the main constraining quality parameters were high contents of iron, manganese, fluoride, and nitrate in some water sources as well as microbial contamination.

However, despite the borehole tested water not meeting the quality standards, it was still supplied to the communities.

Further, it was found out that there was inadequate control of water sources, where agricultural and other human activities including built toilets released their contents close to the water sources.

The report revealed again that on average out of 73per cent of the population served with water, only 9per cent had access to sewer network and 91per cent depended on vacuum trucks to empty their pit latrines and septic tanks.

“Further, I noted that there was inadequate control in the implementation time of water projects and that caused delays for the completion. Here 81per cent of the water projects sampled did not complete on time,’’ said the CAG.

Delays according to Mr Kichere mainly ranged from 3 months to 4 years and were caused by inadequate supervision by the Ministry of Water, LGAs and Urban Water Sanitation Authorities.","The noted reason for the inadequate access to clean and safe water was lack of proper planning associated with implementation in the projects.

56,https://borgenproject.org/tanzanias-struggle-potable-water/,Tanzania’s Struggle for Potable Water,"

As the largest country in East Africa, about one-third of the land in Tanzania is waterless. A little under 50 percent of Tanzania’s citizens do not have access to clean water, totaling around 21.6 million people.

Although there are three lakes that surround Tanzania, it is extremely difficult for individuals to find access to potable water if they do not live near one of these bodies of water.

While there have been attempts to address the situation, there has not been much success. In 1971, the Rural Supply Program was introduced in the hopes that the government would be able to provide free, clean water to the citizens of Tanzania. A lack of donors and technology have led to the low success rate of this project.

In 2002, Tanzania began major reforms in the water sector, and still insists that by 2025, it will have more comprehensive access to safe, clean water. Reforming the water sector has recently made the country a target for foreign donor support. Germany’s state aid agency is one donor that has been extremely involved in providing Tanzania’s water sector with aid.

Private sector donations are also coming from various types of companies. H&M, a Swedish retailer, has created a three-year program that will pair with Wateraid to “improve water provision and sanitation facilities in 36 schools in the rural Manyara district. As well as immediate assistance, H&M hopes the intervention will influence government thinking about water-related issues in schools.”

Wateraid is also working to solve the sewerage issues in Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania’s largest city. The initiative is a for-profit one that removes waste from latrine pits for a small charge in order to reduce disease and improve quality of life in the city.

As a country, Tanzania has become a guinea pig for “water stewardship approaches that involve the wider business community.” The Water Futures Partnership (WFP) has been instrumental in this endeavor.

Although many attempts have been made to rectify the water situation, public awareness still remains a pressing issue. People are accustomed to disposing their waste in the river and unfortunately still fail to recognize that they are not only contributing to the lack of potable water but are also facilitating the spread of water-borne diseases.

In order to make sure the program has a chance of success, there needs to be more open communication and collaboration between the organizations trying to improve access to potable water and the individuals in the populations they are trying to help.

Geography, climate and population Geography The United Republic of Tanzania consists of the mainland and Zanzibar, which is made up of the islands Unguja and Pemba. Its total area is 947 300 km². The country is bordered in the north by Uganda, Lake Victoria and Kenya, in the east by the Indian Ocean, in the south by Mozambique and in the west by Lake Nyasa, Malawi, Zambia, Lake Tanganyika, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Burundi and Rwanda. The terrain comprises plains along the coast, a plateau in the central area, and highlands in the north and south. The border with Kenya is dominated by Mount Meru and Mount Kilimanjaro. Southwards is the Central Plateau reaching elevations above 2 000 m. The mountain range of the Southern Highlands separates the Eastern plateau from the rest of the country. Land cover is dominated by woodland, grassland and bushland which account for about 80 percent of the total area. Agricultural land is estimated to be about 40 million ha, or 42 percent of the total area. In 2013, 15.65 million ha or 17 percent of the country was cultivated, comprising 13.5 million ha of arable land and 2.15 million ha of permanent crops (Table 1).

Climate The climate varies from tropical along the coast to temperate in the highlands. There are two types of seasonal rainfall distribution: The unimodal type, where rainfall is usually from October/November to April, found in the central, southern and southwestern highlands;

The bimodal type, comprising two seasons: the short rains (Vuli) fall from October to December, while the long rains (Masika) fall from March to June. This type occurs in the coastal belt, the north-eastern highlands and the Lake Victoria Basin. Annual rainfall varies from 500 mm to 1 000 mm over most of the country. The highest annual rainfall of 1 000 mm to 3 000 mm occurs in the northeast of the Lake Tanganyika basin and in the Southern Highlands. Mean annual rainfall is 1 071 mm. Zanzibar and the coastal areas are hot and humid and average daily temperatures are around 30°C. October-March is the hottest period. Sea breezes however temper the region’s climate and June-September is coolest with temperatures falling to 25°C. In the Kilimanjaro area, temperatures vary from 15°C in May-August to 22°C in December-March. Population The total population of the country is estimated at 53.5 million in 2015, of which 69 percent is rural (Table 1). The annual population growth rate is 3.2 percent for the 2005-2015 period and the average population density is 56 inhabitants/km². The vast majority of the population lives inland, far away from the coastline. In 2014, the Human Development Index ranks the United Republic of Tanzania 151 among 188 countries and the Gender Inequality Index ranks it 125 among 155 countries for which information is available (UNDP, 2016). Life expectancy in 2013 is 64 years and the under-five mortality in 2015 is 49 per 1000 births, both progressing from 49 years and almost 160 per 1000 in 1995. Around 84 percent of the children in 2013 are enrolled in primary education, but only 33 percent for secondary education. With only 3 point difference in both cases, the female proportion attending school is higher in primary school but lower in secondary school. Adult literacy is 79 percent in 2013, with a gap between female literacy (74 percent) and male literacy (84 percent). Poverty concerns in 2011 over a quarter of the population (28 percent) and is mainly a rural phenomenon (33 percent of rural population). However, urban poverty (16 percent of urban population) has accompanied rapid urbanization (WB, 2016). In 2015, 77 percent of the urban and 46 percent of the rural population were using improved drinking water sources, which is 56 percent of the total population. This represents a minimal improvement since 2002 when 55 percent of the population had access to an improved drinking water source. Yet, it is still better than the sanitation situation which finds in 2015 only 16 percent of the population with improved sanitation facilitation, and only 8 percent in rural areas against 31 percent in urban areas (JMP, 2015). Economy, agriculture and food security The economy is largely based on services and agriculture. In 2014, the gross domestic product (GDP) was US$ 49 184 million (current US$), with an annual growth of 7 percent. It has been constantly more than 5 percent since 2000. Agriculture contributed 31 percent to the GDP in 2014, down from 45 percent 20 years earlier. The sector employs still 67 percent of the active population (WB, 2016) and thus continues to drive the economic growth of the country (MWI, 2009) in spite of the emergence of the new high-growth sectors of mining and tourism. Despite its importance, agriculture is very affected by unreliable rainfall and periodic droughts (MWI, 2009). Smallholder farming covers over 14 million ha, with an average farm size ranging from 0.2 to 2 ha, while commercial farming is spread over 1.5 million ha for just over 1 000 farms. Agricultural production remains predominantly based on smallholder production, with commercial farming concentrating on cash crops. The main food crops grown are maize, dry beans, rice, sunflower, cassava, sorghum, groundnuts, sweet potato and coconuts. Maize is the dominant crop with a planted area of over 4 million ha, followed by dry beans with over 1.1 million ha and rice with around 1 million ha. Traditionally, the country was a net exporter of agricultural products, but it has become a net importer in recent years (FAO, Agwa & IFAD, 2014). The main agricultural products exported are green coffee, tobacco, cashew nuts, cotton, sesame and tea for the 2009-2011 period, while the main agricultural products imported are soybeans, wheat and palm oil. Prevalence of undernourished people is almost 35 percent in 2014 in Tanzania (FAO, 2015), progressing from 41 percent in the last decade. The country has also some of the highest level of malnutrition, with 42 percent of under-five children suffering from malnutrition. Water resources The United Republic of Tanzania has nine major drainage basins that are the basis for water resources management through nine corresponding basin water boards (MWI, 2009):

River discharge and lake levels start rising in November-December and generally reach their maximum in March-April with a recession period from May to October/November. Many of the larger rivers have flood plains, which extend far inland with grassy marshes, flooded forests and ox-bow lakes. The lakes and swamps cover 5.4 million hectares and comprise 5.8 percent of the country (SEI, 2007), in particular Lake Victoria, Lake Tanganyika and Lake Nyasa (Tanzanian name for Lake Malawi), which also form the border to neighbouring countries (Table 4). Other lakes include Lake Rukwa, Lake Eyasi, Lake Manyara, Lake Natron, Lake Balangida. Internal renewable surface water resources are estimated at 80 000 million m³/year and renewable groundwater resources at around 30 000 million m³/year, but 4 000 million m³/year is considered to be overlap between surface water and groundwater, which gives a value of total internal renewable water resources (IRWR) of 84 000 million m³/year (Table 3). External renewable water resources are estimated at 12 270 million m³/year, which is the inflow from the Kanyaru river from Rwanda (4 670 million m³/year) contributing to the Kagera river, and from the Kagera river from Burundi (7.6 million m³/year). Surface water leaving the country is estimated at 15 640 million m³/year through Lake Victoria to Uganda (10 700 million m³/year), through the Kagera border river to Rwanda (7 600/2 = 3 800 million m³/year), through Lake Malawi to Malawi (140 million m³/year) and through Lake Tanganyika to the Democratic Republic of the Congo (1 000 million m³/year). The dependency ratio is around 13 percent and the total renewable water resources are 96 270 million m³/year, or 1 800 m³/year per capita in 2015.

There are 633 dams (MWI, 2009) and the total capacity of large dams is almost 104 200 million m³. This includes 100 000 million m³ which is considered to be the Tanzanian part of the additional storage capacity created in Lake Victoria (shared with Kenya and Uganda) through the construction of the Owen Falls dam at the outlet of Lake Victoria in Uganda. The main dams in the United |Republic of Tanzania are the Mtera, Nyumba ya Mungu, and the Kidatu dams. Leakage, siltation and inappropriate or damaged features are very common: about 21 percent of the 633 dams experience spillage and 12 percent have silted up, requiring hence rehabilitation (MAFSC, 2013). About 90 percent of the country electricity is generated through hydropower from the Great Ruaha and Pangani rivers only (DE, 2006). Small dams are called Charco dams for irrigation, municipal and livestock purposes. Hydrological and topographic conditions largely restrict dam construction in the country, but three major dams are planned: the Farkwa dam in Dodoma; the Lugoda Dam in Iringa; and the Kidunda dam in Morogoro (MW, 2014). Due to the very low rate of population with access to improved sanitation (16 percent), there is little wastewater collected–47 million m³ in 2012–and even less treated and directly used. Similarly, there is little desalinated water, despite the fact that that would help reduce water shortages especially on the Zanzibar islands. International water issues The country shares six international lakes (Table 4), five international rivers included in three of the largest African river basins–Nile, Congo and Zambezi (Table 5)–and seven international aquifers (Table 6). This is more than any other nation in Africa. A large part of the country’s international borders are water bodies: the Ruvuma river with Mozambique, Lake Tanganyika with the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Lake Nyasa and the Songwe river with Malawi, the Kagera river with Rwanda and Uganda and Lake Victoria with Uganda and Kenya. As a result, the United Republic of Tanzania is part of numerous transboundary institutions and agreements for the management of these shared water resources as detailed in the respective tables below. The country is a signatory to the SADC’s Shared Water Course Systems Protocol and its revised version, which provides the basis for the management of international rivers in the SADC region, which consists of 14 countries. Lake Victoria, shared between United Republic of Tanzania, Uganda and Kenya, is part of the Nile basin and is the world’s second-largest freshwater lake (after Lake Superior in the United States of America) and the largest lake in Africa. The Lake Victoria Tripartite Agreement, signed by the three countries, established the Lake Victoria Environment Management Project (LVEMP) to rehabilitate the Lake’s ecosystem. United Republic of Tanzania is a member of the Nile Basin Initiative (NBI), an inter-governmental partnership launched in 1999, together with the then nine other Nile riparian countries. Because both the 1929 and 1959 Nile Water Agreement assigned the Nile's water to Egypt and Sudan without including Tanzania and the other riverside nations, the NBI was intended to strengthen the cooperation within the basin. The NBI, the headquarters of which are in Entebbe, Uganda, prepared a Strategic Action Programme, which consists of two sub-programmes: the Shared Vision Programme (SVP) and the Subsidiary Action Programme (SAP). The SVP is to help create an enabling environment for action on the ground through building trust and skill, while the SAP is aimed at the delivery of actual development projects involving two or more countries. Projects are selected by individual riparian countries for implementation and submitted to the Council of Ministers of the NBI for approval. The NBI is intended to be a transitional institution until the Cooperative Framework Agreement (CFA) negotiations are finalized and a permanent institution created. This new Nile CFA was signed in 2010 by Tanzania and four other countries–Ethiopia, Rwanda, Uganda and Kenya–and in 2011 by Burundi. Egypt strongly opposed this agreement which gives deciding power over large-scale hydraulic projects to a commission representing all the signatories, hence cancelling Egypt's historical right of veto. Sudan, South Sudan, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo are still to decide upon the CFA signature. The CFA was ratified by Ethiopia and Rwanda in 2013 and by United Republic of Tanzania in 2015. Signature of all countries would help organize a comprehensive management of the water resources between the basin countries and find an agreed solution to multiple projects of dams on the Nile for hydroelectricity generation in Uganda and Ethiopia (see also the respective country profiles) (MWI, 2009). The United Republic of Tanzania is also member of the Zambezi Basin Watercourse Commission (ZAMCOM) created in 2004 between the eight countries sharing the basin: Angola, Botswana, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, United Republic of Tanzania, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. The country is also part of the Congo river basin, the world’s second largest river basin after the Amazon river basin, together with Angola, Burundi, Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Congo, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda, and Zambia. The country is however not member of the International Commission of the Congo-Ubangi-Sangha Basin (CICOS), regrouping only four of the nine riparian countries. Similarly, there is no specific joint management of the smaller lakes–Chala, Jipe and Natron–with Kenya, or for the transboundary aquifers. Finally, there are some bilateral agreements and institutions, such as the Songwe River Development Programme with Malawi–aiming to stabilize the course of the river which changed because of floods the corresponding boundary (MW, 2013)–and the Malawi/Tanzania Joint Permanent Commission of Cooperation (JPCC).





Table 6 below summarizes the transboundary aquifers.

Water use Total water withdrawal in mainland Tanzania was estimated for the year 2002 to be 5 142 million m³. Agriculture was the largest water withdrawal sector with almost 90 percent of total, and in particular irrigation (86 percent), while the municipal sector used 10 percent and industry less than 1 percent (Table 7). Without more recent data, the 2002 National water Policy and the 2009 Water Resources Management Act consider that irrigation withdraws about 85 percent of the total water withdrawals. Total drinking water production in 2010 for Dar es Salaam comes to around 300 000 m³/day, i.e. almost 110 million m³/year, although approximately half of this is lost through leakages. The demand, including from industries in Dar es Salaam, is almost 146 million m³/year. Most of this water originates from the Ruvu river, as well as from some boreholes (UNDP, 2011). In 2010, groundwater withdrawal is estimated to be around 462 million m³, mostly for domestic purposes (60 percent), but also for livestock, fishing, etc. (28 percent), irrigation (10 percent) and industries (2 percent). Groundwater is only used for irrigation purposes in sugarcane, fruits such as grapes, vegetable and flower farming. Use of groundwater for industries mostly takes place in urban areas, especially Dar es Salaam where 80 percent of the industries are located (IWMI, 2010).





Irrigation and drainage Evolution of irrigation development Irrigation potential is estimated by the 2002 Study on the National Irrigation Master Plan (NIMP) to be 2 123 700 ha in mainland Tanzania, while for Zanzibar it is estimated to be 8 521 ha. The criteria for this estimate are water resources potential, land resources potential and socio-economic potential. The high potential areas are located in roughly four locations: Mara, Mwanza and Kagera regions;

Arusha and Kilimanjaro regions;

Morogoro region;

Mbeya and Iringa regions. The total irrigation potential from wetlands only is estimated at 851 000 ha (DE, 2006). Irrigation in the form of traditional irrigation schemes goes back hundreds of years in the country. Traditionally, irrigation was practiced on slopes but never in the wetlands. Only flood retention cultivation was carried out in the floodplains. In the early 20th century in the Mbeya region some families introduced stream diversion for rice production, a practice that was rapidly adopted locally (MALC, 2005). Modern irrigation was introduced in the 1930s by private companies and the Department of Agriculture. In the 1950s, additional traditional irrigation schemes were established by smallholders with the support of the government for infrastructures and extension provision, but irrigation development funds were mostly allocated to state farms. In the 1960s, unrealistic targets of irrigation development of 10 000 ha/year were never achieved because of low level of government commitment and funds until the 1974-75 drought that resulted in a major food crisis. In the 1970s, private commercial irrigated farms growing coffee, tea and sugarcane and performing well were nationalized. In the 1980s, priority was given to rehabilitation of traditional irrigation schemes and construction of new modern schemes for parastatal (rice, tea and sugarcane) and smallholders, but both were mostly unsuccessful. External support from 1985 onwards increased the irrigation development rate, but performance remained low. The Government launched a major irrigation development plan in 1994 to address constraints to the sector development. In the late 1990s, the horticultural and floricultural industry developed private irrigated estates with high efficiencies. The total area equipped for irrigation was 184 330 in 2002, of which 122 630 ha of traditional irrigation schemes in equipped wetlands. Geographically, 183 988 ha were located in mainland Tanzania and 342 ha in Zanzibar. At that time 1 428 irrigation schemes (including water harvesting schemes) in mainland Tanzania and 19 irrigation schemes in Zanzibar were inventoried. Figure 2 shows the evolution of the area equipped for irrigation since then. In 2013, 363 514 ha are equipped for irrigation, including 117 000 ha of equipped lowlands by traditional smallholders schemes and 1 000 ha of spate irrigation. However, at least 54 380 ha of irrigation schemes need rehabilitation / modernization (FAO, Agwa & IFAD, 2014). In 2013, out of the 363 514 ha total area equipped for irrigation, the harvested irrigated crop area was 450 392 ha were irrigated and harvested of which 60 863 ha in large irrigation schemes. The harvested irrigated crop area on the full control equipped area of 245 514 ha is estimated to be 333 392 ha.

Most of the irrigated areas are characterized by reliance on the run-of-the river water abstractions for gravity-fed irrigation schemes (MWI, 2009). Water distribution is usually by lined and unlined canals, and furrows and basins are widely used. Sprinkler irrigation is used by a few large-scale commercial farmers, in particular on sugarcane plantations. It is not common amongst smallholders. Localized irrigation is rarely used, mostly to irrigate horticulture and flowers. In 2002, almost all irrigation water on the mainland is surface water, groundwater is utilized on only 0.2 percent of all irrigated areas, in particular by large commercial irrigated farms, such as the Tanzania Planting Company-Moshi (TPC Limited, over 7 800 ha) and and Kilombero sugar estates (IWMI, 2010). More recently, among the 400 irrigation schemes that received financial support for rehabilitation from the Agriculture Sector Development Programme between 2006 and 2013, the major source is surface water, while groundwater supplies only 7 percent of the area, of which 6 percent are from springs (ASDP, 2013). Referring to the total area equipped for irrigation of 363 514 ha, the following types of irrigation are distinguished: Large irrigation schemes (55 229 ha): these are formally planned and designed schemes with full irrigation facilities and usually a strong element of management by the government or other external agencies. Those schemes are developed in the regions of Kilimanjaro, Morogoro and Mbeya. All parastatal managed irrigation schemes and large-scale commercial irrigated farms also fall under this category.

Traditional irrigation schemes (1 137 schemes covering 117 000 ha): these have been initiated and operated by the farmers themselves, with no intervention from external agencies. They include schemes based on traditional furrow irrigation for the production of fruit and vegetables in the highlands and simple water diversion schemes on the lowlands, wetlands or flood plains for rice, called bunded basin flood irrigation (majaluba). Maize is often grown as a flood recession crop during the dry season. Irrigation structures are often temporary and do not allow for full water control, and there are often no drainage structures. Due to poor infrastructure, the water use efficiency of these schemes ranges from 15 to 30 percent (MAFSC, 2013). Most of the traditional irrigation is located in Pangani, Rufiji, Wami-Ruvu Basins.

Improved traditional irrigation schemes (190 285 ha): these are traditional irrigation schemes on which, at some stage, there was intervention by an external agency, such as the construction of a new diversion structure. Hence, they have permanent structures for full control irrigation, drainage and flood protection.

Spate irrigation (1 000 ha): There are some attempts of spate irrigation schemes using flash flood irrigation. The Mlandala scheme (Iramba District) developed in 2006-07 and covering 300 ha was out of irrigation after the intake was damaged, but fortunately repaired in 2011. Also at Igurubi spate/supplementary irrigation scheme (MAFSC, 2013) covers 334 ha (FAO Agwa & IFAD, 2014). Spate is locally called â€œKitivoâ€� in Makanya irrigation scheme covering 300 ha. In addition, there are rainwater harvesting based schemes. This type of artificial water control is not considered as irrigation as such, so these rainwater harvesting based schemes are not included in the irrigated area. Most of these schemes are found in the arid and semi-arid areas of central and western part of the country. In 2001, they cover about 27 200 ha for a catchment area of 220 000 ha in mainland Tanzania, mainly located in the regions of Dodoma, Manyara, Shinyanga, Singida and Tabora and parts of Mwanza, Mara and Arusha. In rainwater harvesting schemes, rainfall is captured directly into small bunded basins or runoff is diverted from residential areas, paths and transient streams to fields in the bottom of the valleys, where mainly paddy rice is grown. The most important system is the diversion of ephemeral streams for distances up to 2 km. Recently, backyard rainwater harvesting also started to be practiced (MWI, 2009). In 2002, gravity-fed irrigation schemes account for over 99 percent of the irrigated area, while the rest uses pumps for water abstraction. The latter schemes are mainly located in the regions of Kagera, Mara and Mwanza. The regions with the largest amount of irrigation are Kilimanjaro, Morogoro, Arusha and Mbeya (FAO, 2005).







Role of irrigation in agricultural production, the economy and society The main irrigated crops are maize and rice, accounting for about 37 percent and 21 percent of the full control harvested irrigated crop area of 332 392 ha in 2013 (Table 8 and Figure 4). Other irrigated crops, accounting for the remaining 42 percent, comprise vegetables (including onion, tomato and leaf vegetables), pulses, sugarcane, cotton, oil crops and roots and tubers. There are also limited areas of irrigated coffee, tea and tobacco. From the above figures, the cropping intensity is 135 percent. Private irrigation schemes produce cash crops such as tea, coffee, cotton and sugarcane.

The performances of improved irrigation schemes have gradually improved in terms of water management and crop yields. For example, paddy yields of up to 10 tons/ha have been achieved by some smallholder farmers or on some previously parastatal farms (now privatized due to high operational costs). However, average yields of 4 to 5 tons/ha only are common on improved traditional or new schemes, but can be as low as 1.8-2 tons/ha. The bulk of rice produced is locally consumed although considerable amounts are exported to neighbouring countries. Production and productivity in most irrigation schemes are generally below expectation, in particular in traditional irrigation schemes. Inappropriate or inefficient methods of land preparation and cultivation contribute to low production and productivity, especially with the dominating use of hand hoe (MWI, 2009). A total of 441 974 households used irrigation according to the 2007/2008 census. Women and irrigation Water fetching is mostly the responsibility of girls, who as a result drop out of school (MAFSC, 2011b). Women play major roles in rural economic development especially in irrigated agriculture, but are limited by customary laws and traditions. Land is indeed largely under the control of male farmers and traditionally women would not inherit, which thus limits their access to land. In addition, traditionally, it is said that women were not supposed to talk in meetings when men are present. They perform nearly all the tasks related to agricultural production, both in rainfed and irrigated farming, and are often working longer hours than their husbands since these tasks add on to household and childbearing activities. However, a study in the Usangu Plains in 1994 evidenced a clear sexual division of labour in rice operations, where only men are irrigating, while women are responsible for or participate in most other tasks. Gender imbalances in irrigation schemes were further evidenced: only 10 percent could access irrigated plots, 20 percent could access irrigation water and irrigation extension services, and 10 percent could receive incomes from sales of irrigated crops (Kweka, 1998). The inequitable access for women to water and irrigated lands set by traditions was reinforced by the lack of resources, supports and skills they could gain. This gender inequity is still to be addressed in 2009 according to the Ministry of Water and Irrigation (MWI, 2009). Water management, policies and legislation related to water use in agriculture Institutions The main institutions involved in agricultural water management are: The Ministry for Water (MW) was created in 2008 from the former Division of Irrigation and Technical Services of the Ministry of Agriculture. Previously there had already been some Ministries responsible for Water: the Ministry of Lands, Settlements and Water Development in 1964, the Ministry of Water Development and Power in 1973 before irrigation management was transferred to the Ministry of Agriculture in 2002. MW is responsible for the development and management of water resources, the preparation of integrated water resources management plans, the planning and designing of dams and the promotion of rational allocation of water with formal water use permits. These tasks are done through the implementation of the National Irrigation Policy in collaboration with the Ministry of Agriculture. Locally, MW also provides technical services through the Zonal Irrigation Units (ZIUs) working with the regional administration and the local governments, as well as promotes integrated water resources management in the basins with the Basin Water Offices (BWOs). The Water Development and Management Institute (WDMI), is the MW entity responsible for research on water management.

Ministry for Agriculture, Food Security and Cooperatives (MAFSC) implements the National Irrigation Policy from crop production and productivity perspective, in particular through its: Ministry of Agriculture Training Institutes (MATIs) and Ministry of Agriculture Research Institutes (MARIs).

The National Environmental Management Council (NEMC) is the advisory body to the Government on environmental matters.

The National Water Board, established in 2012, advises MW on multi-sectoral coordination, integrated water resources planning and management as well as resolution of national and international water conflicts. Linkages between relevant institutions are weak and their respective roles and responsibilities are not clearly defined to the detriment of effective irrigation development. Other constraints to irrigation development include the lack of staff and detailed data on the sector (MWI, 2009). In relation to water and sanitation, two public sector institutions are officially responsible in Dar es Salaam: the Dar es Salaam Water and Sewerage Authority (DAWASA) owns the water supply infrastructure and the Dar es Salaam Water and Sewerage Corporation (DAWASCO) manages the water supply practically (UNDP, 2011). The Energy and Water Utilities Regulatory Authority (EWURA) is in charge of the technical and economic regulation of the water sectors, as well as the electricity, petroleum and natural gas sectors. Water management Water resources in the United Republic of Tanzania are managed according to the 2009 Water Resources Management Act (WRMA) at five levels, from national to local: i) national water board, ii) the nine basin water boards, iii) catchment water committees, iv) district councils and v) water users associations (WUA). The latter are organized in water catchments and are responsible for managing allocation of water resources at local level, managing equitable allocation of resources during drought, and mediating local disputes (Medmu, Magayane, 2005). Irrigators’ organizations, formed from the early 1990s onwards, are to be converted in WUAs. Irrigators’ organizations are custodian of the irrigation scheme ownership and get the Water User Permit from their corresponding basin water board, for which they pay a fee. They organize the operation and maintenance of the schemes, distribution of the water, collection of water fees on behalf of the basin water board, resolve conflicts among members and participate in the scheme development and improvement. They can also guarantee irrigators’ access to financial institutions for credits and establish cooperatives for capacitating and empowering farmers. Most irrigation schemes in Tanzania have management problems due to limited funds, skills and capacities in both financial management and law enforcement. In particular, the 2009 WRMA, does not allow the associations to impose a penalty to the users who fail to pay the service charges (MWI, 2009). The nine basin water boards are preparing IWRMD Plans in Tanzania, each at various progress stages (MW, 2014). They also re-register all water rights granted before the 2009 WRMA, as well as the customary water rights and record the former unregistered ones (MW, 2013). The catchment water committees were still under formation in 2014. Regarding water supply and sanitation services, Community-Owned Water Supply Organizations (COWSOs) are in charge in rural areas, and Water Supply and Sanitation Authorities (WASSA) in urban areas. Finances Irrigation development is constrained by low level of government funding for both irrigation and water storage infrastructures and low rate of private investments due to insecure land ownership rights (MWI, 2009). As a result, irrigation development, together with sustainable water resources and land use management, was set as priority investment in the Tanzania Agriculture and Food Security Investment Plan for 2011 to 2021 (TAFSIP 2011) and two funds–the District Irrigation Development Fund (DIDF) and the National Irrigation Development Fund (NIDF)–were established (MAFSC, 2014). The cost of irrigation infrastructure varies across the irrigation schemes and can be as high as US$18 500/ha for example for a 10 ha new Igingilanyi irrigation scheme in Iringa, which uses groundwater. Unit cost of investment of new irrigation scheme and rehabilitation in Tanzania is lower than the equivalent cost in Sub-Saharan Africa, but the cost for improvement is slightly above (MAFSC, 2013) Policies and legislation The main regulatory framework for irrigation in the United Republic of Tanzania is the 2009 WRMA No.11, which repealed the previous 1974 Water Utilization (Control and Regulation) Act. No.42 as amended by the 1997 Water Laws (Control and Regulation) Act, but not the 1999 Water Laws (Miscellaneous amendments) Act. The 2009 WRMA Act stipulates that all water in mainland Tanzania is vested in the United Republic of Tanzania and introduces more participatory management through the five levels of water management in the country (see water management section above). It was completed by the 2013 National Irrigation Act establishing a National Irrigation Commission. Finally, the 2009 Water Supply and Sanitation Act (WASSA) organizes the water provision services and establishes the National Water Investment Fund (MW, 2014). More generally, the 2004 Environmental Management Act (EMA) requires irrigated agriculture to protect the land, surface water and groundwater resources, as well as the community. A wide range of policies further define the water and irrigation sectors: The 2002 National Water Policy (NAWAPO 2002), which amended the first National Water Policy of 1991, was prepared in part as a response to the growing water use conflicts, especially in the Pangani and Rufiji basins, most of which involve irrigation. It addresses the need for participatory agreements on the allocation of water use and to involve private sector in the resources’ management. It recognises irrigation as a dominant consumptive user the water resources.

The 2002 National Irrigation Master Plan (NIMP) proposed an irrigation development programme for 405 421 ha to be implemented by 2017 that includes only smallholder schemes.

The 2006 National Water Sector Development Strategy (NWSDS) aims to develop a comprehensive framework for sustainable development of the country’s water resources, together with the NAWAPO 2002.

The 2006 Water Sector Development Programme 2006-2025 (WSDP) was prepared to implement objectives of NAWAPO 2002 and NWSDS 2006 (SEI, 2007).

The 2010 Nation Irrigation Policy provides a vision and step-wise prioritization of irrigation development in the country and research with reference to the NIMP. It leads towards the establishment of financing mechanisms for irrigation–DIDF and NIDF (see section finances above). It has the objective of ensuring sustainable availability of irrigation water and its efficient use for enhanced crop production, productivity and profitability that will contribute to food security and poverty reduction. Finally, the Tanzania Agriculture and Food Security Investment Plan for 2011-12 to 2020-21 (TAFSIP) and the National Agricultural Policy of 2013 detail the priority for the agricultural production (FAO, Agwa & IFAD, 2014). Environment and health The major environmental problems remain the deterioration of water quality and pollution of water resources from natural and anthropogenic activities, already identified by the 1997 National Environment Policy. They are evident in many parts of the country in particular for surface water (MW, 2014). The quality of groundwater is generally good to acceptable for most uses. Salinity and high fluoride concentrations may exceed standards in the Pangani Basin. The country’s surface waters have deteriorated over the years due to both point and non-point sources of pollution. Rivers in urban centres, for example Msimbazi in Dar es Salaam, have been used as dumping sites for waste from various sources, polluting these rivers and thus making the water unsafe both for domestic consumption or irrigation, without costly treatment. In addition, outbreaks of waterborne diseases such as cholera and typhoid are common in both urban and rural areas of Tanzania (NBS, 2015). Salinity is building up in some irrigation scheme as a result of poor irrigation management and lack of adequate infrastructures (MAFSC, 2013). Finally, tremendous increasing trends of flows in most of the rivers and water levels in dams and lakes have been observed from 2006 to 2014, in particular in Lake Victoria and Lake Tanganyika with an increase of the latter’s water level by 2 meters. Prospects for agricultural water management The 2006 Agriculture Sector Development Strategy has set a target of irrigating about one million hectares by 2016, but data from the 2006-2013 period shows that this target will definitely not be achieved on time (MAFSC, 2013; NBS, 2015). The more realistic target of 405 400 ha equipped for irrigation by 2017, set by the 2002 National Irrigation Master Plan (NIMP), is still limited by the financial capacities available but is not impossible, especially with regards to ongoing projects such as the Rice Centre of Excellence in Eastern Africa, for which around 20 000 ha are to be equipped for irrigation, and the Kilangali Seed Farm project, with irrigated agriculture on about 100 000 ha. The irrigation development rate increases in the last years, with the 2011-2016 target of an additional 40 000 ha hectares under small-scale improved irrigation infrastructures almost completed through the construction of small scale dams in particular (MAFSC, 2014). The abundant sources of water, co-existence of several agro-ecological zones and the almost unexploited 2.3 million ha irrigation potential still permits tremendous irrigation expansion and diversification in crop production that could contribute significantly to stabilizing agricultural production and increasing income. Only access to both water and land locally and for some vulnerable groups may be a binding constraint in some cases. Main sources of information ASDP. 2013.

Tanzania is the fourth most populous country in Sub-Saharan Africa, home to more than 55.6 million people. The country’s macroeconomic outlook is positive, with GDP growth of 6.5 percent per annum over the past fifteen years and significant reductions in poverty since 2007.

Despite this progress, 40 percent of its population, some 21 million people, lack access to improved drinking water and more than double that figure, almost 43 million people, lack access to improved sanitation. The country recently fell a long way short of reaching its Millennium Development Goal (MDG) targets for water and sanitation, which was “to halve the proportion of people without improved drinking water and sanitation in 1990 by 2015.” Now, the new Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) aim to reach universal access to safe water and sanitation by 2030, an aspiration that appears even more daunting.

“Reaching for the SDGs: The Untapped Potential of Water Supply, Sanitation, and Hygiene in Tanzania” is a summary report of the findings of the Tanzania WASH Poverty Diagnostic (TWPD) study led by the World Bank’s Water and Poverty Global Practices team. TWPD identifies the nature of challenges of water supply, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) access in Tanzania and proposes ways to prioritize those challenges in moving forward to meet the new SDGs. It concludes that WASH must improve not only for the sake of the sector itself, but also because of the broader knock-on effects that it has on crucial dimensions of human development and poverty reduction.

TWPD discusses the country’s current development and poverty context before moving on to the ways in which poverty and WASH overlap. It then examines the different dimensions of WASH deficiencies in the country, and how these differ along economic and geographic lines. Next, it delves into specific linkages between WASH and human development, with a focus on stunting—a nutrition issue of immense importance in the Tanzanian context. It then provides an overview of the bottlenecks in the institutional and policy context that thus far have been constraining greater progress in the sector. Finally, the report offers recommendations on how to speed progress toward national and global objectives with a focus on the bottom 40% of the wealth distribution (B40).

This Executive Summary provides an overview of the key messages and recommendations of the work conducted.

Key Messages

Message 1: Tanzania Faces Ambitious SDG Targets for Water and Sanitation against a Backdrop of Low Coverage and Slow Progress during the MDG Era

The SDGs call for universal access to safely managed water and sanitation by 2030. Beyond providing technologically improved water and sanitation facilities, the country will also need to meet rigorous standards on service quality. For instance, to have safely managed water, a household must have access to a technologically improved water source that is on premise and delivers uninterrupted and clean water, free of chemical and bacterial contaminants. To meet the sanitation target, a household will need an unshared, improved sanitation facility that has regular fecal sludge management and is equipped with a handwashing station with available soap and water (JMP 2017).

However, Tanzania’s performance during the MDG period sets a difficult task for meeting the ambitious SDGs. Globally, Tanzania is among the 17 countries that could not meet the water xvi Reaching for the SDGs: The Untapped Potential of Tanzania’s Water Supply, Sanitation, and Hygiene Sector target and among the 69 that missed the sanitation target. Compared to its East African neighbors and the Sub-Saharan region, Tanzania had the smallest gains in improved water coverage during the MDG period and, despite making progress in sanitation, had the secondworst improved sanitation coverage (figures ES.1a and ES.1b). Tanzania is the second-largest economy in the East African Community (EAC) and has comparative advantages that could support strong economic growth: it is a resource-rich coastal hub and has good demographic dividends and political stability. Its shortcomings in the water and sanitation sector are somewhat surprising. Slow progress during the MDG era may make the SDG targets seem out of reach, but now the country has the opportunity to revise and revitalize efforts to ensure that all Tanzanians live in a safe WASH environment that bolsters their quality of life.

Message 2: Improved Water Services Are Largely Underdeveloped for Rural Dwellers and Unreliable for Too Many Urban Inhabitants

National improved water coverage is only 60 percent, meaning that some 21 million people lack access to a water source that is built with technology that prevents contaminants from entering the system. (See figure ES.2.) Rural areas have the worst improved water coverage—48 percent compared to 87 percent in urban areas. Many rural Tanzanians instead rely on traditional opendug wells (24 percent) or surface water (18 percent). In urban areas, people who cannot access tap or borehole water may turn instead to costly, informal tanker trucks or water vendors.

Furthermore, just 48 percent of the population has access to an improved water source that has a collection time of 30 minutes or less, and only about 25 percent have access to a water source on their household premises. Without proximal access to an improved source, many Tanzanians, particularly rural women, must travel long distances to retrieve water for drinking and other domestic needs, taking away valuable time from productive activities. On average, Tanzanians spend 36 minutes per trip to collect water. Assuming that water collection is a daily activity, with at least two trips per day, a household on average devotes more than eight hours per week to collecting water.

Though urban dwellers tend to have better access to improved water services close to their homes, they too face challenges of unreliable service, high dependence on informal providers, and low water quality. For instance, two-thirds of piped water users report an interruption in service at least once every two weeks. These problems stem from financial and service delivery problems at the urban utilities. For example, DAWASCO, Dar es Salaam’s utility, suffers from high rates of non-revenue water, consistently exceeding 50 percent over the past three years. Figures like these may reduce the utilities’ ability to invest in expanding and improving services for the sprawling urban population. In Dar es Salaam, 18 percent of the bottom 40 rely on informal tanker trucks.","“Reaching for the SDGs: The Untapped Potential of Water Supply, Sanitation, and Hygiene in Tanzania” is a summary report of the findings of the Tanzania WASH Poverty Diagnostic (TWPD) study led by the World Bank’s Water and Poverty Global Practices team.

I have more time to help my husband with our cattle – which was quite difficult without access to clean water. It’s such a relief,” Zuena, a farmer from Machui, said of the African Development Bank’s Zanzibar Water and Sanitation Project, completed in 2015. Her household recently benefited from the Machui project. “It has changed our lives,” she said.

“Your testimony provides us with further incentive to continue supporting the efforts of your country in providing safe and reliable water and sanitation services to the population of Zanzibar,” responded Mohamed El Azizi, Director of the AfDB’s Water and Sanitation Department, while visiting the Zanzibar Water and Sanitation Project.

The project’s positive effects were confirmed by all the beneficiaries encountered during the project site visit. All of them confirmed the reduced burden of fetching water from long distances, freeing time for women to engage in other productive activities, as evidenced by Zuena’s story.

The project has provided a boost to entrepreneurial activities such as healthier livestock thanks to improved access to water supplies from the project. “My cows are producing more milk now. I have more money for my family,” said Maida, a farmer in the same region, Machui.

Other socio-economic activities such as vegetable farming have also benefited from the project.

Fatma, a teacher at Mgenihaji School, has witnessed all the improvements brought by the project. “Before the new sanitation facilities were constructed, teachers and students in the primary school and a nearby nursery school had significant problems with regard to sanitation facilities,” she said.

The project also took into account specific needs of the target groups. At Mgenihaji School, Maimuna, a disabled student, explained the benefits from user-friendly sanitation facilities installed under the project, for which she expressed much appreciation.

The Water and Sanitation Project in Zanzibar was supported by a loan from the African Development Fund and a grant from the Bank’s Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Initiative to the tune of US $54 million, alongside contributions from the Government of Zanzibar and UN-Habitat.

The project, which was completed in 2015, comprised the construction of nine rural water supply schemes in the islands of Unguja and Pemba. It also included the rehabilitation and extension of urban water supply systems in the three townships of Chake Chake, Wete and Mkoani on Pemba Island. It has also seen the construction of school water and sanitation facilities in Unguja and Pemba, as well as rainwater harvesting systems. It has financed the development of an integrated water resources management action plan and funded institutional development and capacity building support to the Zanzibar Water Authority (ZAWA), the agency responsible for the provision of water services in Zanzibar.

While acknowledging the ownership and commitment shown by the Government of Zanzibar and ZAWA in implementing water projects, Mohamed El Azizi reiterated AfDB’s commitment to better serve the country. “We are proud of the project achievements and committed to providing hands-on support to the AfDB-supported water operations in Zanzibar through our Resident Representative in Tanzania and our water experts in our country office,” he said.

A new AfDB-supported operation aimed at improving water and sanitation services in Zanzibar municipality is currently in progress and will include interventions in Zanzibar Stone Town, which is a UNESCO World Heritage Centre with socio-economic and touristic significance.

The Director’s visit to the water project in Zanzibar was undertaken on sidelines of the 6th African Water Week, held in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, from July 18-22, 2016, under the theme of achieving Sustainable Development Goals on Water Security and Sanitation. “Clean, accessible water for all is an essential part of the world we want to live in,” said El Azizi.

Due to poor financing or poor infrastructure, every year, many Africans, most of them children, die from diseases associated with inadequate water supply, sanitation and hygiene. For this reason, water and sanitation are at the heart of the African Development Bank’s operational priorities recently approved by its Board of Directors – the High 5s for Africa: Light up and power Africa; Feed Africa; Industrialize Africa; Integrate Africa; and Improve the quality of life for the people of Africa. Since 2001, the Bank has approved nine water and sanitation operations in Tanzania mainland and Zanzibar at a total cost of about US $700 million.

According to El Azizi, water and sanitation will remain one of the key development challenges facing the communities and nations of Africa. Water and sanitation, he said, will have a direct impact on the economic growth and the attainment of most of the Sustainable Development Goals, the international targets that replaced the Millennium Development Goals in 2015.

The share of rural water and sanitation programs now accounts for over 40% of the AfDB’s total active water and sanitation portfolio. This demonstrates the strategic importance of socio-economic development in rural areas.","It’s such a relief,” Zuena, a farmer from Machui, said of the African Development Bank’s Zanzibar Water and Sanitation Project, completed in 2015.

DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - When Lucas Mahiga still fished a decade ago, there was more water in the Kilombero Valley’s Mkele River and catches were good. But now water levels have dropped, making it impossible to earn a living as a fisherman.

“I have stopped fishing, and I’m now engaged in fruit and vegetable farming,” Mahiga said.

The 52-year-old, who lives in Chisano village in Tanzania’s eastern Morogoro region, recalls better times when the river was home to different fish species, most of which have now died off due to insufficient water.

Local residents says there’s no doubt the climate in the Kilombero Valley - which sprawls across 7,679 square km some 200 miles (322 km) southwest of Dar es Salaam - is changing fast.

The vast wetland, listed as a protected site under the Ramsar Convention, has lost most of its perennial rivers. They have dried up completely or become seasonal, affecting the livelihoods of thousands of people.

The Kilombero Valley is struggling to retain its reputation as the nation’s bread basket, as climate and water stresses take their toll.

Chisano residents say the valley has been hit by recurring droughts, while expanding human activities - including livestock grazing and farming - are making water shortages worse.

Richard Muyungi, director of climate change in the Vice President’s Office, told Thomson Reuters Foundation climate change is already damaging people’s livelihoods and the wider economy. Droughts and floods have pummeled many areas, denting food production and causing water scarcity.

“While the government is committed to addressing this global problem (of climate change), the affected people must make serious efforts to take adaptation measures, such as irrigation and sustainable farming, to minimise the risks,” he said.

WATER SPENDING BOOST

Tanzania is endowed with many river basins that play a key role in providing water and income for local communities. But its water resources are under growing pressure from both human and climate impacts.

Media reports indicate that conflict between herders and farmers over shrinking water supplies and pastureland is rife in many areas.

Water shortages are a chronic problem in Tanzania, mostly affecting the rural population. According to the World Health Organization, one out of six Tanzanians lacks access to safe drinking water, due to population growth, rapid urbanisation and climate change, among other factors.

In response, Tanzania has embarked on major reforms in its water sector, aimed at promoting access to water for both urban and rural communities.

According to the Ministry of Water, the government has decentralised water and sanitation services to about 20 urban and 100 district utilities in the past 10 years in a bid to bring water management closer to the people it is supplying.

Official data shows the water sector has received a significant boost in public spending over the past decade, since it was first included as a priority in the national strategy for growth and poverty reduction.

According to a 2013 report on the country’s water sector development programme, the Tanzanian government and its development partners committed funds to the tune of $1.364 billion over the five-year period ending June 2013, 43 percent more than initially planned.

Yet Tanzania is still failing to provide enough clean water for its people. Only 57 percent in rural areas had access to water in 2012, compared to 51 percent in 2000, according to the report. The government will need to speed up its efforts if it is to meet the Millennium Development Goal target of providing water services to 74 percent of its population by 2015.

Herbert Kashillilah, a technical advisor with Water Aid Tanzania, told Thomson Reuters Foundation, that while the government has boosted finance and technical assistance to the water sector considerably, implementation of programmes is proving a challenge due to gaps between policy and practice on the ground, and a lack of accountability.

HYDROPOWER SUFFERS

At the World Economic Forum in Davos last month, Tanzanian President Jakaya Kikwete made an emotional appeal to the international community to help East African nations tackle water scarcity.

""When I was growing up, there were many rivers - and during the rainy season many people were washed away. These days, those rivers are running dry,” the president said.

Hydropower, which generates over 60 percent of the country’s electricity, has also been hit by acute water shortages, he added.

""We depend on hydropower generation, but in the last decade, it has become very unreliable as dams do not have enough water,” he said.

Lakes are also declining. The water level in Lake Victoria has fallen by 1 metre and Lake Manyara has receded by 7 kilometres. And cross-border tensions between Tanzania and Kenya are growing, as people fight over dwindling water resources.

Kikwete said the international development agenda tends to favour education and health at the expense of access to water, which is critical for both sectors.

""Water is not considered a priority - if you talk about health, in Africa, many diseases are waterborne. Clean water is part of health,"" he said.

A 2011 study on climate change and cholera in Tanzania said higher temperatures and shifts in rainfall patterns posed serious risks to human health, including a greater possibility of diarrheal diseases.

""For a 1 degree Celsius temperature increase, the initial relative risk of cholera increases by 15 to 29 percent,"" it said.

POOR INFRASTRUCTURE

Henry Mahoo, professor of agricultural engineering at Sokoine University of Agriculture, warned that unless Tanzania adopts better water management strategies - especially in farming - it will not be able to avoid worsening water woes.

""One of the critical constraints to agriculture in East Africa is water scarcity, which may be defined in terms of access to water. In some places water is abundant, but getting it to people is difficult because of the lack of infrastructure,” Mahoo said.

According to a 2011 study on the economics of climate change in Tanzania, rising temperatures may reduce water availability, as well as exacerbating extreme events such as drought and floods, which affect the water sector. That will be critical for the country's tourism, fishing and farming industries, the report said.

""There could be reduction in rainfall, river flow and groundwater systems that will have potentially large impacts for household water supply, irrigation, industry and the functioning of the existing water infrastructure and ecosystems services,” the study warned.

Tanzania needs at least $600 million per year to fight climate change effects, it added.

By Kizito Makoye

PAWAGA, Tanzania, March 3 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Daudi Nangole sits under a huge baobab tree, watching his herd of cattle drink from a dam in Ikolongo village - a place that until recently was a no-go area for pastoralists.

The 56-year-old herder, his family and their 73 cattle, sheep and goats travelled several kilometres to reach the reservoir.

""I was very afraid to come here before because angry farmers were killing our animals,"" Nangole said, as dry leaves swirled around him. ""But now cattle can roam freely.""

Ikolongo is one of several villages in the Iringa region of Tanzania's southern highlands, where farmers and pastoralists have regularly clashed over water. Frequent drought has forced herders, who usually stick to the mountains, down into the valleys where most settled farming takes place.

The fighting that sometimes breaks out between the two groups can turn deadly. In February, one person was killed and several others injured, including two policemen, during violence at Dihida village in the rural district of Morogoro.

In Pawaga division, however, farmers and herders have brought an end to decades of hostility with a deceptively simple solution: talking to each other.

They have come together in a loose coalition to resolve their issues through dialogue. Set up by the civil society-led Tanzania Natural Resource Forum (TNRF), the coalition tries to build understanding between members about their needs, and motivate them to find alternative solutions to tensions.

And it seems to be working. ""We don't have issues with farmers any more,"" Nangole said. ""We have agreed to share what is available equally.""

Already the two groups have settled on areas where pastoralists can take their cattle to drink without impinging on the water needs of farmers.

They have also made a deal allowing pastoralists to feed their herds on rice husks that would normally be discarded after harvesting, for a small fee to the village government. Pastoralists get food for their animals and rice farmers dispose of excess husks cleanly.

""We saw that this agreement would help a lot to ease unnecessary tension during the dry season,"" said Khalfani Lulimi, a ward councillor in Itunundu village, where the fees are being used to build classrooms for a primary school.

Tanzania has over 611,200 sq km of grazing land, around 70 percent of which is in use. The rest is in a government land bank.

Changing weather patterns are making water harder to find, and frequent changes in land rights add to the struggles of farmers and herders looking for land they can use.

BRIBERY

Farmers often accuse pastoralists, who are generally more affluent, of bribing local leaders to let them graze in areas reserved for farming.

A 2014 study by the TNRF revealed external factors that also contribute to the tensions. These include ""green grabbing"" where the state takes land for conservation, a rise in large agricultural investments, corruption and a lack of infrastructure to support pastoralism as a viable livelihood.

""Those who kill each other are not the cause of the problem - and this fact is unknown to them,"" said Godfrey Massay, the TNRF's land-based investment coordinator. ""When I see a farmer and a pastoralist fighting, I honestly find no justification as to why that should happen.""

Pawaga division, with its plains and valleys, had become the epicentre of local conflict between pastoralists, farmers and wildlife conservationists, all with competing interests.

But the coalition, launched in June 2015, gives pastoralists and farmers the chance to meet in a neutral space and vent their frustrations ""without fear or favour"", said Massay. The groups meet twice a month, and whenever an issue arises.

According to the TNRF, besides the sharing solutions the groups have already come up with, the coalition has exposed the corruption that feeds on their fighting.

Villagers have identified community leaders who were receiving bribes from pastoralists while at the same time plotting with farmers and police to arrest those who trespassed on farmland.

""Farmers and pastoralists need to know that there are people who benefit from their conflicts and do not wish to see them resolved,"" Massay said.

LAND-USE PLAN

When the TNRF launched the Pawaga coalition, most important to its success was that both sides understood the bigger picture at the top level.

After months of negotiations, leaders were elected and rules of conduct set. The coalition was then introduced to the district authorities and struck up a close working relationship with village leaders.

According to Henry Mahoo, professor of agricultural engineering at Tanzania's Sokoine University of Agriculture, partnerships like this are essential to coming up with solid solutions for land and water clashes.

Tensions between farmers and pastoralists can best be resolved by drawing up a land-use plan that clearly identifies areas controlled by the two groups, he said.

""All concerned parties must be involved in the negotiation process, and there must be a forum where farmers and pastoralists openly talk about their problems,"" he added.

The Pawaga coalition has already developed some by-laws followed by all 12 villages and 60 hamlets in the area, to guide and enforce land-use decisions.

As a result, the number of violent clashes has dropped dramatically, according to Iringa district land officer Donald Mshauri.

""This shows that no matter how deep the conflict is, it can be resolved by just talking,"" he said.

In Tanzania, the initiative aims to provide safe drinking water in 165 villages across the country. “The project represents an opening for new sources of financing that will help to close the vast investment gap in rural drinking water supply in Tanzania and focus on mobilising private sector investment in line with the World Bank’s Maximizing Finance for Development (MFD) approach,” says Zaruhi Tokhmakhian, Acting Head of the GPRBA.

Solar-powered drinking water supplies will replace systems that run on highly polluting generators. According to Kitila Mkumbo, the permanent secretary at the Tanzanian Ministry of Water, solar-powered installations will reduce operating and maintenance costs. This will not only lead to lower water prices, but also to greater coverage of underserved rural areas.

The new facilities are expected to provide drinking water to 500,000 people in the 165 villages targeted by the project. The project will also allow the implementation of “mobile money” in the receipt of revenue from the sale of water, a service previously used for the supply of solar home kits. Finally, the World Bank loan will be repaid over a four-year period.

68,https://www.oxfam.org/en/press-releases/contaminated-water-grave-threat-somalis,Contaminated water a grave threat to Somalis,"As “World Water Day” is marked 22 March with events around the world, today millions of Somalis remain in danger by simply taking a drink of water. Contaminated water and a lack of sanitation are killers in this country, where waterborne diseases are a constant threat to health. Only 30% of Somalis have access to clean water, leaving the majority vulnerable to several life threatening diseases.

“Clean water should be available to all, but sadly that’s far from the reality in Somalia,” said Daud Rahoy, Officer in Charge for HIJRA, (Humanitarian Initiative Just Relief Aid, local Oxfam partner) in Mogadishu. “Diseases from contaminated water and poor sanitation are all too common. Young children and women are especially vulnerable to the spread of such diseases.”

Increasing health risks

Large portions of the Somali population are at continuous risk from waterborne diseases like Acute Watery Diarrhea (AWD), cholera and polio. Since 20 January this year, there have been at least 216 cases of Acute Watery Diarrhea (AWD) in South Central Somalia, with the number of cases increasing sharply in the past month. Diarrheal diseases contributed to the deaths of thousands of people during the 2011 – 2012 famine in Somalia.

Besides the lack of safe drinking water, poor hygiene and a lack of sanitation are significant contributors to high disease rates. In Somalia less than one in four people have access to improved sanitation. The numbers are worst in rural villages where toilets and latrines are rare, and open defecation stands at 83 percent; the third highest rate in the world.

Water prices rising

The lack of clean water at this time of year, has also led to a sharp price increase for drinking water. In Tooratooroow, a small village north of Afgooye, the price for a barrel of water (200 litres) now costs 100,000 Somali Shillings, (more than US$5) a price far out of reach for most Somali families. That is a more than 100 percent price increase in the past two months.

Oxfam is there

While 860,000 people are still living in crisis conditions, many foreign donors have reduced their humanitarian aid budgets for Somalia. Oxfam and HIJRA have continued to supply clean water and sanitation to 158,000 people living in several of Mogadishu’s camps for the displaced. With donor funding drastically reduced this year, the threat of closing these life sustaining water programs in the camps has risen.

“The humanitarian community urgently needs money to keep clean water accessible in all of the camps for Mogadishu’s displaced,” said Enzo Vecchio, Oxfam Somalia Country Director. “Oxfam calls on international donors not to abandon these people in need, and provide support for clean water programs in Somalia. We must ensure that vulnerable people are not needlessly exposed to risks when looking for water elsewhere. In the long term Mogadishu needs a sustainable water supply, but in the short term vulnerable communities need water now to survive.”

Comprehensive solutions needed

“A comprehensive approach to reducing waterborne diseases must include increasing access not only to safe drinking water, but also to improved sanitation, while addressing hygiene behavior,” said Daud Rahoy of HIJRA. “Integrated programs which include water, sanitation and public health promotion will reduce these outbreaks of waterborne diseases in Somalia.”

The global theme for World Water Day this year is “Water and Energy”. Worldwide, 768 million people lack access to improved water, and 2.5 billion people have no improved sanitation.","Contaminated water and a lack of sanitation are killers in this country, where waterborne diseases are a constant threat to health.

69,https://borgenproject.org/drought-water-quality-in-somalia/,Drought Affecting Water Quality in Somalia,"For a country whose entire eastern border is an ocean, water quality in Somalia is a longstanding worry for the nation’s citizens. According to UNICEF Somalia’s Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) studies, of the nearly 15 million people living in Somalia, only 45 percent of them have access to clean water. Only one in four people have access to adequate sanitation facilities within a reasonable distance of their homes.

WASH has linked the lack of clean water and sanitation facilities to the rising disease rates in Somalia, most notably, the widespread prevalence of widespread waterborne diseases such as diarrhea that account for more than 20 percent of deaths of children under five. Additionally, the lack of clean water is heavily correlated to malnourishment, which over 300,000 children in Somalia are currently suffering from.

While having clean drinking water is imperative to survival, the disposal of wastewater (water used for cooking, bathing, sewage and other uses) is nearly as important to providing a safe and clean environment for Somalians to live in. Considering that the infrastructure to dispose of wastewater is severely lacking in Somalia, and the fact that most Somalians rely on rivers and rainwater for water (natural sources which are highly prone to contamination by wastewater), it is little surprise that so many Somalians lack adequate drinking water.

Estimates indicate that it would cost $1.5 billion to provide clean water to all Somalians that would not be dependent on weather patterns, droughts or possible contamination by wastewater. While by no means a small sum, it is also not an outrageous one, and one that is being decreased by efforts to improve Somalian irrigation techniques, harvesting and storing cleaner rainwater, as well as other methods to help Somalia use less water more efficiently.

These efforts, however, are only made tougher due to the twofold threat of the terrorist organization al-Shabaab, which controls much of rural Somalia, where the lack of clean water is felt most severely, and the harsh drought and famine that is currently sweeping the country. While food and water supplies are already running low, al-Shabaab puts up blockades and refuses to let aid workers assist the starving and thirsty people. In March, the Somali prime minister reported that over a hundred people had died as a result of the drought, and that number has likely only continued to worsen as concerns over the water quality in Somalia continue to linger.

Organizations such as UNICEF have stepped up to combat the water shortages by providing medical services and other necessities. Most pressingly, UNICEF was providing over 400,000 people with daily water as of early 2017. Members of the group hope and plan to increase that number fourfold and provide water vouches to well over a million people.

USAID has already committed more than $300 million towards humanitarian assistance in Somalia for 2017. Much of that money is devoted to assisting the UNICEF WASH programs and activities already underway; however, the Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance has involved itself in an attempt to address the emergency caused by the drought through other initiatives. This assistance is key to helping those affected survive the droughts and allow time for more sustainable solutions to be put in place to improve the water quality in Somalia.

In Somalia, 2.7 million people are still in need of humanitarian WASH support1 after decades of protracted crisis. United Nations agencies, non-governmental organizations, and organizations specialized in assessments collect large amounts of data, which is often challenging to analyze because of its overwhelming amount, uneven quality and incomplete coverage.

To make sense out of this data, this assessment conducted a process of data collation, synthesis and analysis building on a desk study of all relevant data available, with a focus on quantitative data collection initiatives.

The general objective of the assessment is to understand and analyze WASH-related needs across Somalia to support evidence-based planning and advocacy by the WASH cluster. To achieve this goal, it contains the following specific objectives:

To understand the current WASH-related needs in Somalia. To identify key factors and underlying causes of these needs and vulnerabilities. To lay the foundation for continued monitoring and analysis by the WASH cluster. To provide a robust evidence base to assist WASH cluster planning in Somalia and improve the effectiveness and efficiency of programming.

Accordingly, the following assessment is based on a review of quantitative WASH data, including the data being used by the WASH cluster in support of the 2020 Humanitarian Needs Overview (HNO) and Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP).

The second source of data used for this report is from REACH’s third annual Joint Multi-Cluster Needs Assessment (JMCNA). It entailed surveys of 10,783 households during July 2019 in 53 of the 74 districts in Somalia. Results are statistically representative for displaced and non-displaced households at the district-level. Figures for the total district population including displaced and non-displaced populations were aggregated based on the proportion of the population they encompassed. For the districts where non-displaced populations were surveyed, but not non-displaced, the population mean is based solely on the non-displaced population. District-level results were aggregated to the national level by weighting district averages by the percent of the national population in the district. Additionally, the assessment was intended to further investigate specific issues and themes pre-identified by the WASH Cluster, through Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) to add additional depth to the understanding of the issues and to better integrate the perspectives of beneficiaries.

To this aim, twenty-four FGDs were conducted in September 2019 in Baidoa, Banadir, Galkayo, and further stratified by urban/rural, sex, affected group, disability, and ethnicity. Each FGDs consisted of six to eight participants.

The following key indicators used for the JMCNA show the pressing level of WASH needs in Somalia.2 A third of the households reported not having enough drinking water, half reported lacking access to improved latrines, water sources, and soap, while three quarters reportedly did not have menstrual hygiene materials (e.g. menstrual cloth, pads, tampons, menstrual cups, etc.).

According to secondary data, wasting (GAM WHZ<-2)3 prevalence is estimated to be 13% nationally,4 representing a “serious” severity classification that warrants a public health concern calling for action.5 Current data for stunting (HAZ<-2),is classified at a “low” severity level (7%) nationally.7 However, it should be noted that this data from Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) is far lower than previous thorough nutritional assessments (25%)8 in Somalia and in neighboring nations like Ethiopia (38%)9 and Kenya (26%),10 which are classified as “high” when between 20-30% and “very high” when above 30%.11

There is an inadequate quantity of improved latrines. The JMCNA additionally found that shared latrines reportedly remain common as reported by 46% of the households with access to latrines, 12 though almost no FGD participants supported having shared latrines because of the lack of privacy and cleanliness. 13 If it cannot be avoided, respondents reported not wanting to share latrines with more than two other households.14 For households with access to a latrine, more than half nationally (54%) reported having their own latrine, while the rest (46%) reportedly use shared facilities.15 Non-displaced households (60%) were reportedly twice as likely to have private latrines compared to displaced households (31%).16 The majority of FGD participants reported supporting the gender separation of shared latrines.17

Hygiene practices remain insufficient, leading to a heightened risk of water-borne disease. Less than half of the FGD participants reported washing their hands regularly after defecation.18 JMCNA data showed that a majority of the households (79%) reportedly have a handwashing facility within 15 minutes travel time.19 However, less than a third of households (31%) reported a functional handwashing facility at their latrine.20 Non-displaced households, on the other hand, were reportedly much more likely (34%) to have one than displaced households (20%).21 When soap was unavailable, FGD participants reported using water only, ash, and sand at even numbers.

A majority of latrines lack basic fixtures such as lights, locks, or are inaccessible to disabled persons, with a greater proportion of latrines accessed by displaced households reportedly lacking basic fixtures. The JMCNA showed that three quarters (75%) were reportedly lockable from the inside and, less than a third (32%) had lighting at night. Non-displaced households (37%) were reportedly over three times as likely to have lighting in latrines compared to displaced households (10%).23 While the JMCNA found 91% of latrines were reportedly accessible for disabled people, 24 a large majority of disabled FGD participants expressed issues of access them, including difficulties in using the toilets and transporting water when asked what were the main challenges accessing WASH services.

JMCNA data showed that households employing WASH-related coping strategies generally had low levels of access to WASH services. Therefore, the use of these strategies did not improve wellbeing and livelihood conditions. Hence, they could be seen as mitigation measures that reduce the worst impact, rather than compensation measures that make up for the loss due to a shock.26

Of all focus group participants, almost two-thirds reported being satisfied or very satisfied with WASH programming. About half reported that WASH programming supports the priority needs of their community. Two-thirds felt that their communities were involved in decision-making about WASH programming. Around a quarter reportedly knew of complaint mechanisms existing, how to use them, or saying they work well.27

A quarter of FGD participants thought WASH facilities and Non-Food Items (NFIs) were of good or very good quality.

However, there were considerable differences between the types of facilities and items: water points and storage were thought very favorably of, while the others were viewed poorly. Very few thought WASH facilities and NFIs lasted a long time. Again, water-related services were thought to last longer than other types. Toilets were the most remarked upon service as many complained that they were not dug deep enough, were of low quality, and collapsed when it rains. Garbage collection sites were also mentioned often with participants noting that they filled up quickly and were prone to collapsing.28

The key figures above indicate a high level of WASH needs in Somalia. Physical wellbeing and living standards conditions remain severely low, while there is limited availability and use of coping mechanisms. The results of this assessment are intended to assist policy makers in evidence-based decision making. While this report provides a general summary, the accompanying database and information products contain the complete range of WASH indicators aggregated by district and nationally and by displaced, non-displaced, and total populations.","The general objective of the assessment is to understand and analyze WASH-related needs across Somalia to support evidence-based planning and advocacy by the WASH cluster.

Somaliland is located in the Horn of Africa, with an area of 137,600 km2 with a population of about 3.85 million according to the Ministry of National Planning and Development (Somaliland in Figures, 2011). Somaliland is a majorly water scarce country with no perennial river flow making groundwater is the main source of water for the majority of the people in Somaliland.

In Somaliland estimates say that 55% of Somaliland communities live in rural areas but less than 20% have access to improved water supplies and nearly 88% lack access to universal sanitation.

This must be addressed and this is complicated significantly by: (i) Continued conflict, (ii) The low rainfall and very complex hydrogeology of the country, (iii) The centrality of pastoralist livelihoods to the economy, (iv) Weak or absent local government institutions.

The program involves rehabilitation of existing earth dams and construction of boreholes and additional dams in unserved areas. According to the Bank’s ESAP, the project is classified as Category 2 mainly because most impacts are site specific and have no significant and irreversible detrimental effect. According to the Bank’s Climate Safeguards System, the program is classified as Category II, requiring the implementation of adaptation measures to increase the resilience of communities and the water infrastructure to be rehabilitated and constructed to withstand the impacts of climate change. The program details are at preliminary stage and the detailed designs shall be developed during project implementation. For these reasons, the type of Environmental Assessment tool for at this stage is the development of the Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF).","Somaliland is a majorly water scarce country with no perennial river flow making groundwater is the main source of water for the majority of the people in Somaliland.

72,https://reliefweb.int/report/somalia/waterborne-diseases-pose-lethal-threat-children-southern-somalia,Waterborne diseases pose lethal threat to children in Southern Somalia - Somalia,"Rapid response needed as cholera cases increase

NAIROBI, Kenya, 18 August 2011 - With an increased number of confirmed cholera cases in Mogadishu, and growing reports of acute watery diarrhea in Kismayo and other crowded urban centers, an urgent multi sector response to contain the spread of this highly contagious disease is being mounted.

The combination of poor sanitation conditions, a shortage of safe water, overcrowding and high malnutrition rates, creates the perfect combination for infectious diseases, such as cholera and pneumonia, to spread and increase the number of deaths. About seventy-five percent of all cases of acute watery diarrhea are children under the age of five.

Cholera has been confirmed in Banadir, Bay, Mudug and Lower Shabelle regions and the number of acute watery diarrhea cases has increased dramatically in the last few months. Since January this year, 4272 cases of acute watery diarrhea/cholera have been reported in Benadir Hospital in Mogadishu alone. However, at this stage most of the cholera cases in the various regions are contained and under control.

“Our major concern is to monitor and detect new disease outbreaks in the many informal settlements set up by internally displaced people in and around Mogadishu”, says Dr. Marthe Everard, WHO Representative for Somalia. “For the last few years, a network of health workers reporting to the early warning system is in place, however they report through a health facility or mobile clinic. Yet the large numbers of displaced people in Mogadishu are making it more difficult to record the various diseases.

We urgently need more mobile clinics that will provide basic health care services to the many displaced and who will strengthen the reporting on new outbreaks. This is critical to our response and our ability to save lives.”

Although cholera is endemic in the country, the last major cholera outbreak was in 2007 with an estimated 67,000 cases. In recent years, efforts to chlorinate the water supply of Mogadishu, along with efforts to improve hygiene and sanitation have prevented a serious outbreak but with the large influx of some 100,000 people alone this year into Mogadishu, bringing the total number of IDPs in the capital to an estimated 470,000, many are living in overcrowded settlements, there is an acute shortage of safe water and adequate sanitation.

“There is no need for a child to die of diarrhea, yet this is tragic reality for a Somali child, who is acutely malnourished. It is a lethal combination.” said Rozanne Chorlton, UNICEF Representative for Somalia. “These types of diseases can be prevented and treated quickly, but to save children’s lives we need to make sure safe water, sanitation and hygiene along with early access to primary health care, are an integral part of our emergency response.”

Partners in the health and water and sanitation sectors are currently preparing for a potential 100,000 cholera cases including 80,000 moderate cases and 20,000 severe cases. Emergency diarrheal disease kits made up of medical supplies such as syringes, infusions, and oral rehydration fluids (ORS), already prepositioned by UNICEF and WHO have been sent to 13 hospitals. An additional 200 diarrheal disease kits, each able to treat 100 severe cases and 400 moderate cases are being procured and should be in Southern Somalia in the next few weeks.

In addition, the case management of severe dehydration with and without malnutrition is being strengthened and focus is now on mobilizing a network of already trained community health promoters to move from door to door with health hygiene education messages. Health posts will be stocked with essential medicines and ORS to identify and promptly treat patients.

Many of Southern Somalia’s rural areas and urban centers rely on shallow wells, which unless protected or treated with chlorine can serve as the perfect breeding ground for water borne diseases.

To respond to this threat and prevent a major outbreak, partners in the water, sanitation and hygiene sector are scaling up their actions to target 1.5 million people across high risk areas of the south.

Supplies of chlorine and essential items for hygiene and household treatment and storage of water are being distributed. Already 217 water sources are being chlorinated and 58 water point outlets benefitting 483,200 residents and internally displaced people in Mogadishu.In addition, household hygiene supplies, including water purification tablets, soap and buckets, enough for 48,000 families, are being distributed at existing feeding centers for malnourished children. Campaigns to educate families about the treatment of drinking water, safe disposal of waste and encourage hand washing with soap will also be scaled up in high risk communities.

As part of the updated 2011 UN Consolidated Appeal for Somalia, an estimated $80 million is needed for the health sector and $78 million is required for the water, sanitation and hygiene sector. So far only 30 percent and 37 percent respectively has been raised for each sector.

Note to Editors:

Cholera is an acute diarrheal infection caused by ingestion of food or water contaminated with the bacterium Vibrio cholerae. Every year, there are an estimated 3–5 million cholera cases worldwide and 100,000–120,000 deaths due to cholera. The short incubation period of two hours to five days, enhances the potentially explosive pattern of outbreaks.

Cholera is an extremely virulent disease. It affects both children and adults and can kill within hours. About 75% of people infected with V. cholerae do not develop any symptoms, although the bacteria are present in their faeces for 7–14 days after infection and are shed back into the environment, potentially infecting other people. Among people who develop symptoms, 80% have mild or moderate symptoms, while around 20% develop acute watery diarrhoea with severe dehydration. This can lead to death if untreated. People with low immunity – such as malnourished children or people living with HIV – are at a greater risk of death if infected.

Cholera transmission is closely linked to inadequate environmental management. Typical at-risk areas include peri-urban slums, where basic infrastructure is not available, as well as camps for internally displaced people or refugees, where minimum requirements of clean water and sanitation are not met. Cholera is an easily treatable disease. Up to 80% of people can be treated successfully through prompt administration of oral rehydration salt.

Water-Borne Diseases Threaten Children’s Lives in Southern Somalia

An urgent multi-sectoral response is being mounted to contain the spread of cholera. UNICEF (UN Children’s Fund) and WHO (World Health Organization) say there is an increasing number of confirmed cases in Mogadishu and reports of growing numbers of acute watery diarrhoea in the port city of Kismayo.

Some 75 per cent of all cases of highly infectious acute watery diarrhoea are among children under the age of five. Poor sanitation conditions, a shortage of safe water, overcrowding and high malnutrition rates are the perfect combination for infectious diseases, such as cholera and pneumonia, to spread and increase death rates.

Cholera is confirmed in Banadir, Bay, Mudug and Lower Shabelle regions and the number of acute watery diarrhoea cases has increased dramatically in the last few months. Since January this year, some 4,200 cases of acute watery diarrhoea/cholera were reported in Benadir Hospital in Mogadishu alone.

However, at this stage most of the cholera cases in the various regions are contained and under control.

“Our major concern is to monitor and detect new disease outbreaks in the many informal settlements set up by internally displaced people in and around Mogadishu,” said Dr. Marthe Everard, WHO Representative for Somalia.

“For the last few years, a network of health workers reporting to the early warning system has been in place, however they report through a health facility or mobile clinic. Yet the large numbers of displaced people in Mogadishu are making it more difficult to record the various diseases,” she added.

“We urgently need more mobile clinics that will provide basic health care services to the many displaced and who will strengthen the reporting on new outbreaks. This is critical to our response and our ability to save lives,” Dr. Everard said.

Cholera is endemic in Somalia but the last major outbreak was in 2007 with 67,000 cases. In recent years, efforts to chlorinate the water supply of Mogadishu, along with efforts to improve hygiene and sanitation prevented a serious outbreak. But there is now an acute shortage of safe water and adequate sanitation with the influx of 100,000 people this year into Mogadishu, bringing the total number of displaced people in the capital to 470,000 with many living in overcrowded settlements.

“There is no need for a child to die of diarrhoea, yet this is a tragic reality for a Somali child who is acutely malnourished. It is a lethal combination,” said Rozanne Chorlton, UNICEF Representative for Somalia. “These types of diseases can be prevented and treated quickly. To save children’s lives we are making sure that safe water, sanitation and hygiene along with early access to primary health care are an integral part of our emergency response.”

Emergency diarrhoeal disease kits made up of medical supplies such as syringes, infusions, and oral rehydration salts (ORS), already prepositioned by UNICEF and WHO, have been sent to 13 hospitals. An additional 200 diarrhoeal disease kits, each able to treat 100 severe and 400 moderate cases are being procured and should be in southern Somalia in the next few weeks. These items would enable partners in the health and in the water and sanitation sectors to respond to up to 100,000 cholera cases including 80,000 moderate and 20,000 severe cases.

In addition, case management of severe dehydration with and without malnutrition is being strengthened. The focus is now on mobilizing a network of community health promoters to move from door to door with health hygiene education messages. Health posts are being stocked with essential medicines and ORS.

Many of southern Somalia’s rural and urban areas rely on shallow wells, which - unless they are protected or treated with chlorine - can be a perfect breeding ground for water-borne diseases.

Partners in the water, sanitation and hygiene sector are scaling up to target 1.5 million people across high risk areas of the South. Supplies of chlorine and essential items for hygiene and household treatment and storage of water are being distributed. Already 217 water sources are being chlorinated, and 58 water point outlets are benefitting 483,200 people in Mogadishu.

In addition, household hygiene supplies, including water purification tablets, soap and buckets, enough for 48,000 families, are being distributed at existing feeding centres for malnourished children. Campaigns to educate families about the treatment of drinking water, safe disposal of waste and encourage hand washing with soap will also be scaled up in high risk communities.

As part of the updated 2011 UN Consolidated Appeal for Somalia, an estimated USD$80 million is needed for the health sector and $USD78 million is required for the water, sanitation and hygiene sector. So far only 30 per cent and 37 per cent respectively has been raised for each sector.

UNICEF NZ urgently needs funds to help children in Southern Somalia and other countries in need in East Africa. NZ$19.50 buys a water kit for a family to enable them to collect, store and purify water, so that their children are able to safely drink and wash.

Tog Wajaale, 2 December 2018 – Safe, affordable water is now being delivered to hundreds of thousands of families in areas of Somaliland thanks to a sustainable water system inaugurated today by the Government of Somaliland, the European Union, UNICEF and partners.

The Improving Urban Water Service Delivery in Somaliland Project brought together government, private water companies and communities through a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) model to address the water scarcity endured by generations of Somaliland communities. Water systems in four towns – Borama, Burao, Erigavo and Tog Wajaale – were rehabilitated or rebuilt with the generous funding provided by the EU and technical support from UNICEF and partners. Some 800,000 people now have sustainable access to safe drinking water thanks to the concerted efforts.

''Water is a basic right. It plays a crucial role in our lives. We are glad that the people of Somaliland and in particular Tog Wajaale now have access to clean and affordable water. It is a far better alternative to the unhygienic and expensive water previously supplied from the earth dam at the border with Ethiopia,'' said Mr Fulgencio Garrido Ruiz, EU Chargé d'Affaires to Somalia. ''We are extremely proud to be here, witnessing this important milestone and the realization of the prayers of so many communities to have access to safe and clean water for the first time,'' he concluded. Overall, in Somaliland, 68 per cent of the population have access to a reliable water source.

However, the disparity between urban and rural areas is significant. In rural areas, only 28 per cent of households can access an improved water source. For many Somaliland communities, their struggle to get clean water is compounded by poor infrastructure and intensifies in periods of crisis such as the 2017 drought.

“Access to safe, affordable and sustainable water was a dream for so many people in Somaliland,” said Jesper Moller, UNICEF Acting Representative. “Today, that dream has finally been realised for many children, women and their families in Somaliland. We are grateful for the government’s strong leadership and the EU’s generous funding in making this huge undertaking a success. This achievement is a true testament to the commitment and hard work of all partners involved, and the courage, resourcefulness and resilience of the people of Somaliland.”

These are two grants worth a total of US$ 28.8 million from the African Development Fund (ADF), the AfDB’s concessional loan window.

These funds will be used to finance the implementation of a regional road network rehabilitation project and the Kismayo and Baidoa urban water supply project, located in Jubbaland and Southwestern State respectively. For drinking water, the ADF provides the Somali government with $11.99 million.

The Kismayo and Baidoa Urban Water Supply Project will lead to the completion of a water resources assessment study for the city of Kismayo. The environmental assessment will then make it possible to design and build a suitable supply system. The Somali government will also set up a groundwater monitoring system in Baidoa city. The latter will allow drilling to be carried out. Some educational institutions, health centres and markets will also benefit from improved water and sanitation facilities, as well as hygiene promotion training for teams. The project is expected to start by mid-September 2019 and to be completed at the same time of year in 2023.

The AfDB-funded project will benefit more than 200,000 people in Kismayo and Baidoa, as well as satellite communities. According to the Somali government, the urban water supply project in the two localities will mainly help to relieve the displaced populations “who represent 43 per cent of the population and who have contributed significantly to the growth of the urban informal sector in both cities, and who are experiencing great difficulties in the provision of drinking water and aspire to better sanitation services”.

ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast, June 10, 2020/ — With 2.6 million internally displaced persons in Somalia, the outbreak of COVID-19 poses an additional challenge in an already fragile situation, leaving the population highly vulnerable.

Thankfully, the African Development Bank-financed water supply and sanitation project came in handy as a critical control intervention, although COVID-19 was not anticipated in 2016 when the project was launched.

Through its implementing agency, the International Organization for Migration (IOM), internally displaced persons (IDPs), hard-to-reach rural communities and vulnerable populations now have access to clean water. The project is also promoting good sanitation and hygiene practices by constructing public handwashing stands to help slow the spread of COVID-19 across vulnerable communities in Somalia.

The project received funding from the United Kingdom within the framework of the Multi-Partner Somalia Infrastructure Fund, established in October 2016 to mobilise resources for rehabilitation and development of infrastructure, and related skills development and institutional capacity building. Other donors who have contributed to the Fund include the European Union, Italy and the Islamic Development Bank.

“The African Development Bank and the International Organization for Migration were the first partners to provide us with handwashing facilities and to create community awareness of COVID-19,” said Mohamed Sheik Aden, a medical officer in the Kismayo District in Jubaland.

The $10.4 million Improving Access to Water Supply and Sanitation in Rural Somalia Project, which is to be completed in December 2020, also aims to reduce mortality among children under 5 years.

So far, the project has rehabilitated 26 boreholes and 30 mini water systems, providing 85,282 households with access to clean water. The boreholes are equipped with 18KW solar power systems to ensure their operational sustainability. An additional 30 mini-water systems are currently being constructed under the project and, once completed will provide clean water to an additional 20,000 households.

“The continuous hygiene promotion has helped those of us in IDP camps to better understand the pandemic and how handwashing is critical to prevention,’’ said Halima Aden of the Danwadaag IDP settlement in Dhobley Port of Entry.

In close coordination with the Somali Ministry of Water and Energy, Ministry of Health, and Federal Member States, 62 handwashing points have been established at health facilities, ports of entry, markets, and community centres in Kismayo and Dhobley IDP sites in Jubaland State.

Additional 60 handwashing points will be established in the coming months.

By the end of May 2020, the project had provided access to handwashing facilities to 60,000 people and distributed soap and sanitary materials to 2,209 vulnerable households. This intervention has helped to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. There are plans to distribute washing soap to 2,000 vulnerable households over the next weeks.

Hygiene promoters have been engaged to educate communities on preventive practices, in line with World Health Organization guidelines. These efforts have improved hygiene levels in the camps, helping vulnerable communities and families curb the spread of the coronavirus and other sanitation-related diseases.

As at the end of May 2020, there were 81 trained hygiene promoters with a target to reach 14,368 vulnerable households (80,311 individuals). There were also 225 community hygiene workers. COVID-19 prevention materials were translated in Somali language and distributed. There are plans to reach an additional 10,000 households (60,000 people) over the next weeks.

“I now have the opportunity to clean my hands before and after visiting the health centre in my community. This is critical to the prevention of COVID-19,” said a user simply identified as Aisha.

“Before the handwashing facilities were installed, patients coming to the centres had contact with walls, chairs, tables and sometimes with us, increasing the risks for everyone to get infected,” said Hamdi Muktar, a client at a health facility in Alaneley.","Thankfully, the African Development Bank-financed water supply and sanitation project came in handy as a critical control intervention, although COVID-19 was not anticipated in 2016 when the project was launched.

78,https://www.devex.com/news/opinion-in-the-battle-against-covid-19-women-make-somalia-stronger-97345,"Opinion: In the battle against COVID-19, women make Somalia stronger","Brave health workers. Brilliant researchers. Responsible leaders. Solidarity. Around the world, the COVID-19 crisis reveals what makes us strong. But it also highlights what makes us fragile.

Opinion: Women have a major role in rebuilding Somalia — the private sector must support them Against security threats, female and male allies in Somalia’s private sector can make a real difference — plugging gaps in training and education, while removing barriers to formal employment. This op-ed explains how.

In Somalia, this includes two decades of conflict, frequent droughts, floods, and disease outbreaks. These challenges have weakened our health system. Multiple hazards have also forced many people to flee their homes, with more than 2 million currently living in camps where physical distancing is difficult and access to clean water is limited.

Somali culture — our focus on community and helping one another through trying times — has been a source of strength in confronting these hardships. However, during this pandemic, it will be hard to prevent our people from visiting friends and relatives, especially if they are sick. All of these characteristics make Somalia’s response to COVID-19 highly complex and demanding.

In responding to COVID-19, women make us strong

We can only rise to this challenge by drawing on the active contributions of women. They are a critical asset and source of resilience as we face the pandemic. During and after conflict, Somali women have stepped in to meet the immense needs of our communities. Due to death and displacement of male relatives, women currently head about half of all households and, across the country, generate an estimated 70% of household income.

Women make up the majority of health care workers, and women at home provide care that is not available from the formal health care system. Due to conflict and violence, their care burden is already heavy. In the coming weeks and months, women will again shoulder most of the responsibility of caring for the sick.

Gender inequalities make us fragile

The gender inequalities that prevent women from fulfilling their potential make us more vulnerable during this crisis. Women disproportionately work in the informal economy, with no protection in case they become sick or lose income.

To improve our understanding of women’s challenges in this context, my ministry — the Ministry of Women & Human Rights Development — recently interviewed 42 women engaging in small-scale business in Mogadishu while we carried out a food relief drive.

The women we spoke to sold imported secondhand clothes and a variety of food and drinks along the main streets of the city. Unfortunately, restrictions associated with the coronavirus had already dealt a devastating blow to their business. The curfew in place there has reduced the time they have to hawk their goods, while reduced human mobility in Mogadishu has shrunk demand.

What’s more, the closure of airports and seaports has meant that many of the goods they sell — including candies and clothes — are no longer available because they have to be imported. As a result, the women we spoke to had lost their income, threatening their own well-being and that of the six children each of them provided for, on average.

At the same time, women’s lower literacy rates — 36% for females ages 15 and over, compared with 44% for males — and access to technology will make it even more difficult to provide them with the information they need to protect themselves and their families from infection. Among the women we interviewed, few believed the coronavirus even existed.

When women fall ill or their care burden becomes overwhelming, families will also begin to pull young girls out of school to help. This will, again, be at the expense of the education and skills development of Somali women and girls. Extremely high levels of gender-based violence, exacerbated by decades of conflict, compound these challenges and undermine women’s capacity to care and provide for their families.

For these and other reasons, gender inequalities will intensify the effects of the pandemic on women and, given their critical contributions, on our society.

We cannot afford to waste women’s potential

What does this mean for our response to COVID-19? It means that addressing gender equality and women’s distinct experiences is not a long-term luxury.

Doing so is an integral element of an effective response to the coronavirus. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s Development Assistance Committee has rightly recognized that responses must take into account the role of women and girls and aim to reduce inequalities and protect human rights.

During and after conflict, Somali women have stepped in to meet the immense needs of our communities. —

First and foremost, women, gender experts, and gender machineries must actively, fully participate in developing and implementing response and recovery plans. This can help ensure that response plans and economic assistance both mainstream gender issues and include dedicated support that is urgently needed for the distinct challenges faced by women.

To this end, my ministry continues to conduct research and consultations on the specific needs of women and other vulnerable groups as the COVID-19 situation evolves. We bring the results to all of those involved in planning our response to the pandemic to help identify solutions that work for everyone.

To realize these interventions, we need all hands on deck. In particular, we count on the continued strong cooperation of our partners in supporting gender equality and women’s empowerment.

In this light, I strongly welcome the recent opinion piece by Jorge Moreira da Silva, director of the OECD’s Development Co-operation Directorate, and DAC Chair Susanna Moorehead, who have called for donors to protect existing commitments of official development assistance during this crisis and to target support to vulnerable people — including women and girls — in lower-income countries.

As we respond to the current emergency, we also have to look to the future. COVID-19 reminds us that addressing the structural drivers of gender inequality is both women’s right and an investment in future resilience. As we rebuild our economies and societies after this pandemic, we have to focus on reducing inequalities.

While Somalia faces great challenges, our transition from conflict also provides unique windows of opportunity to do so. Our ongoing constitutional review and preparations for our first “one person, one vote” elections in 2020-21, for example, provide key openings to enshrine women’s rights and participation in the foundations of our state — and thereby build a society that withstands crisis by realizing the potential of all of its people.

MOGADISHU, Somalia, May 28, 2019 – Somalia is facing a severe drought that threatens to be worse than the pre-famine conditions of 2016-17. With the failure of the 2019 Gu rains, meant to fall from April to June, Somalia faces its second consecutive below-average rainy season, while the country is still recovering from the impact of the previous drought.

By the end of this year, almost one million children are anticipated to be malnourished in Somalia, 175,000 of which will be severely malnourished which means without any external support their chances of survival are slim. 1.7 million people face acute food insecurity, more than double what we saw at this time in 2017, and that number is expected to reach 2.2 million by July.

Richard Crothers, Somalia Country Director at the International Rescue Committee, said,

“This current drought is set amidst conditions that in many ways are worse than what we saw in 2017. Even if some rains come this month, the damage is already done. The population has by no means recovered from the devastation of the pre-famine two years ago. It takes a considerable amount of time for people to recover from a major loss in their livelihoods and livestock. There just hasn’t been enough time for this to happen. People are already vulnerable and unable to shield themselves from a shock of this scale. Add to this, the water table has not sufficiently replenished, so boreholes are already getting tapped out much sooner.

What’s more is the numbers of those already displaced from their homes is almost double what they were prior to the 2017 drought. With over 2.6 million people displaced, we have a very different situation. The starting point of this 2019 drought is extremely concerning and we know things are only going to get worse. The international community must scale up its response and invest in early action and resilience programs now if we are to avert a major humanitarian disaster.”

The IRC is already operational in the main areas of concern, Puntland and central Somalia, and is significantly scaling up our programming to support families with healthcare for malnourished children, unconditional cash transfers to help people quickly get the support they need, rehabilitation of boreholes and water sources as well as mobile health services to reach deeper into hard hit areas.

The IRC began working in Somalia in 1981 in the aftermath of the Somalia-Ethiopia conflict. Over the years operations faced several interruptions due to insecurity and civil unrest but has been operating continuously since 2007.

The International Rescue Committee responds to the world’s worst humanitarian crises, helping to restore health, safety, education, economic wellbeing, and power to people devastated by conflict and disaster.

Somalia has been experiencing a multi-layered, complex, and protracted crisis over the past three decades. Insecurity and armed conflict continues to exacerbate the effects of periodic natural disasters and climate-driven shocks, such as droughts and flooding. The compound and complex nature of the crisis continues to influence displacement patterns and constrain the availability of resources, while the presence of armed groups severely impedes the level of access and support provided by humanitarian actors. Crops have been affected by large swarms of locusts in the region in late 2019 and again in 2020. These infestations have impacted large areas of the country. In addition, in March 2020, COVID-19 cases were confirmed in the country. This situation and the precautious steps taken to curb the spread of the virus have further complicated both the needs of households, and the ability of humanitarian agencies to respond to needs.

There is thus a pressing need for an integrated and harmonised humanitarian response plan to continue support and interventions which address these complex impacts, and an imperative for continued nationally-representative needs assessments to provide the required evidence base for such response planning. To this end, REACH is supporting the fourth Joint Multi-Cluster Needs Assessment (JMCNA) in Somalia. The assessment will build on the previous cycle of needs assessments, as well as existing assessments conducted by other humanitarian actors, such as the seasonal studies carried out by the Food Security and Nutrition Analysis Unit (FSNAU). However, while such assessments focus on specific needs, hot-spots, or are conducted at the livelihood zone level, the JMCNA seeks to address information gaps by ensuring that the severity of needs relevant to each cluster are assessed in a way that enables comparison across the country, across population group types, and geographical areas. Moreover, the JMCNA directly addresses the information gaps in crosscutting needs at the household level and facilitates the understanding of the co-occurrence of different sectoral needs.

Thus, the JMCNA aims to facilitate a harmonised response plan at the operationally relevant district level; it relies on the concerted and coordinated efforts of all partners to encourage joint planning, implementation of the assessment and data collection, and the analysis and interpretation of results. The ultimate goal of the assessment is to inform partners at the strategic level and as such is timed to be completed in advance of the Humanitarian Needs Overview and Humanitarian Response Plan process, scheduled to begin in September 2020.","Insecurity and armed conflict continues to exacerbate the effects of periodic natural disasters and climate-driven shocks, such as droughts and flooding.

The eastern Ethiopian highlands, which are responsible for most of the river flow along the Juba and Shabelle Rivers, also recorded significant amounts of rainfall during the same period. Heavy rains led to flash floods in northern regions and riverine flooding along the Juba and Shabelle Rivers in the south.

The rainfall forecast for the week ending on 17 May 2020 shows a significant reduction of rains across Somalia, with rainfall confined mostly to southern and coastal parts of southern Somalia. However, along the Juba and Shabelle rivers high to moderate flood risk is likely to persist in the next two weeks because of incoming river flow from the upper catchments. The high Shabelle and Juba river levels are expected to continue to threaten urban and riverine populations along the two rivers.

Shabelle River: River levels continued to rise following heavy rains within the Shabelle River basin in both Ethiopia and inside Somalia. Mataban, Belet Weyne, Bulo Burti, Jowhar and Balcad rainfall stations recorded over 50mm in the last week. Today, 11 May, the river level at Belet Weyne is 8.10m, which is already above the High flood-risk threshold and just 0.20m less than the bank-full level of 8.30m. Parts of Belet Weyne riverine areas have been experiencing flooding since the end of last week, where many HH's have since evacuated. The river level at Jowhar continued to rise slowly reaching 5.3m as of today, which is above the high flood-risk threshold and only 0.2m below the 5.5 m bank-full level. Flooding is currently reported also in Jalaalaqsi.

Localized flooding continued in Tugaarey village within Jowhar district inundating over 500 hectares of farmland and displacing over 400 households. A similar trend has been observed in Balcad and the lower reaches of the river where flooding was reported in Kurtunwaarey. The levels are expected to continue rising along the entire channel of Shabelle as more waters from the eastern Ethiopian highlands are still streaming in. High risk of flooding is foreseen along the Shabelle during this week; and Moderate Risk the following week. It is advisable that riverine communities within low-lying areas of Belet Weyne who have not evacuated yet to do so, while following guidelines by the local authorities. Existence of river breakages (50 points identified and reported by SWALIM in February 2020) along the Shabelle is likely to exacerbate the flooding unless urgent measures are taken in river management.

Juba River: River levels increased significantly in the last three days at Dollow, Luuq and Bardheere monitoring stations, all within Gedo region. Flooding has been reported for two days and expected to continue in the week due to the high flows being transmitted from Ethiopian and Kenyan sides. Using high-resolution satellite images, SWALIM identified more than 50 Km2 of flood-affected areas along the Juba since 23 April 2020 and has continued to increase to date. Affected areas include Dollow, Belet Hawa, Luq, Saakow, Buaale, Jilib and Jamame districts. Given the current high levels and rainfall forecast, there is a High risk of flooding along the entire Juba river channel this week; and Moderate Risk the following week.

In Bay and Bakool regions: Moderate to heavy rains were recorded in Bay and Bakool regions over the last week. The forecast for this week indicates reduced rainfall prospects in these regions with no flood risk anticipated.

Somaliland, Puntland, and Central regions: Since the beginning of the current rainy season in April, moderate to heavy rains have been reported in many parts of the northern and central regions. However, there was a reduction of rainfall in Somaliland while moderate to high precipitation were reported in parts of Puntland. Heavy storms in Baran (Sanaag region) on 06 and 07 May 2020 led to severe flash floods and destruction of properties and cropland. This week will see a reduction of rainfall amounts in both northern and central regions with no risk of flash floods expected.","The current Gu (April-June 2020) season rains continued with moderate to high intensity in many places across Somalia during the week that ended on 10 May 2020.

As water levels rise in rivers, there are reports of riverine flooding in Jubaland. FAO’s Somalia Water and Land Information Management (SWALIM) reported heavy rains in Somaliland where on 26 April, Lughaye and surrounding areas received unusually heavy rains of 102mm. On 23 April, heavy rains were also received within the Juba river basin. SWALIM forecasts increased rainfall activity in most areas in Somalia and in the Ethiopian highlands in the coming week, which is likely to keep the water levels high in the Shabelle and Juba rivers. The flooding has started barely four months after heavy Deyr (October-December) rains inundated parts of Somalia, affecting over half a million people; and as the country works to contain the COVID-19 virus, which is exponentially rising and has already infected several hundreds of people. The country is also working to contain a desert locust infestation. OCHA, 24 Apr 2020)

Since 20 April, heavy rain has been affecting most of Somalia States and territories (particularly South West, Jubaland, Banadir, Puntland, and Somaliland) as well as the neighbouring central and south Ethiopia since 24 April, causing rivers to overflow and triggering floods that have resulted in casualties and damage. The worst affected area is the Juba river basin and the Shabelle river basin. In Somalia, as of 29 April, media report 10 fatalities, a number of missing people, around 20 injured people, hundreds more displaced, as well as damage to infrastructure in Qardho Town (Bari Region, west Puntland). (ECHO, 29 Apr 2020)

The number of people affected by flooding in Somalia has risen to 546,103, of whom 216,895 people have been displaced from their homes and 16 others killed since the Gu’ rains started in early April. At least 27 districts are inundated; the worst being Belet Weyne in Hiran region where riverine flooding has displaced more than 115,000 people, according to the district flood taskforce. This includes about 91,000 people who have been displaced from the four sections of the town and 23,220 people from 23 riverine villages. The flooding resulted from a sharp rise in the level of the Shabelle river following heavy rains in Somalia and the Ethiopian highlands. According to the taskforce, more people were fleeing their homes as river levels rise. As of 10 May, the river levels reached 7.93 meters which is 0.37 meter below the bank full level of 8.30 meters.

Ongoing flash and riverine flooding in Somalia has affected about 918,000 people, of whom 412,000 have been displaced and 24 killed, in 29 districts, as of 16 May. The risk of disease outbreaks is high due to crowding in areas where displaced people are seeking temporary shelter. (OCHA, 16 May 2020)

As of 19 May, ongoing flash and riverine flooding in Somalia has affected about 919,000 people, of whom 412,000 have been displaced and 24 killed, in 29 districts. Belet Weyne in Hiraan region is the most affected district after the Shabelle river burst its banks on 12 May, inundating 85 per cent of Belet Weyne town and 25 riverine villages. According to the district flood taskforce, about 240,000 people were displaced from the town and neighbouring villages between 12 and 18 May. In Jowhar district, Middle Shabelle region, riverine flooding has affected more than 98,000 people in 37 locations, bringing the total affected in Hirshabelle to 338,000 people. According to the Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs and Disaster Management in Hirshabelle State, nearly 40 per cent of those affected in Jowhar have been displaced from their homes. The risk of disease outbreaks is high due to overcrowding in areas where the displaced people are seeking temporary. (OCHA, 5 Jun 2020)

Flash and riverine floods have since late June affected an estimated 191,800 people in Hirshabelle, South West and Jubaland states as well as Banadir region. Among those affected, about 124,200 people have been displaced from their homes. Another 5,000 peope are at risk of further displacement in Jowhar, Middle Shabelle. Since May, an estimated 149,000 hectares of farmland have been damaged by floods in 100 villages in Jowhar, Mahaday and Balcad districts, Middle Shabelle region. (OCHA, 26 Jul 2020)

The latest floods point to a worrying pattern where extreme weather conditions are increasing in frequency and intensity. Prior to June 2020, flash floods and riverine flooding caused by seasonal rains displaced more than 450,000 in the country. With floods in 2018 and 2019 displacing 281,000 and 416,000 persons respectively, the flood-based displacement figures demonstrate a rising year-to-year trend. Somalia’s re-occurring climate related emergencies result in devastating impact on communities who heavily rely on farming and livestock for their livelihood. (UNHCR, 7 Aug 2020)

Riverine flooding continues to displace people and inundate farmland in rural areas mainly along the Shabelle river valley. The floods, which are attributed to the Hagaa seasonal rains, have affected nearly 500,000 people since late June in Hirshabelle, South West and Jubaland States, as well as Banadir region.

Frightened and confused, he herded sleepy family members onto the roof of their home in central Somalia as scores of thousands of people in the town, Beledweyne, scrambled for their lives. Clinging to an electric power pylon by the edge of the roof, the family watched as their possessions were washed away.

“I could hear people, perhaps my neighbors, screaming for help but I could only fight for the survival of my family,” the 38-year-old Sabrie, the father of four, recalled. As one of his children wailed, the family waited for more than 10 hours before a passing rescue boat spotted them.

An aerial view of the flooded Hiran region of central Somalia, Nov. 12, 2019. Somalia's recent flooding is the latest reminder that the nation must prepare for extremes predicted to come with climate change.

Death toll unknown

Authorities have not yet said how many people died in the flooding last month, Somalia’s worst in recent history and the latest reminder that the Horn of Africa nation must prepare for the extremes expected to come with a changing climate.

At least 10 people went missing when their boat capsized after the Shabelle river burst its banks. Local officials have said at least 22 people in all are presumed dead and the toll could rise.

“This is a catastrophic situation,” Mayor Safiyo Sheikh Ali said. President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed, who visited the town and waded through submerged areas, called the devastation “beyond our capacity” and pleaded for more help from aid groups.

With no proper emergency response plan for natural disasters, local rescuers used rickety wooden dhows to reach trapped people while helicopters provided by the United Nations plucked people from rooftops. African Union and Somali forces have joined the rescue operations and the Somali government airlifted food.

“Many people are still trapped in their submerged houses and we have no capacity and enough equipment to cover all areas,” said Abdirashakur Ahmed, a local official helping to coordinate rescue operations. Hundreds are thought to still be stuck.

Children displaced by recent floods reach the outskirts of the town of Beledweyne in central Somalia, Nov. 4, 2019.

More rain, flooding

With more heavy rains and flash flooding expected, officials warned thousands of displaced people against returning too quickly to their homes.

More than 250,000 people across Somalia were displaced by the recent severe flooding, according to the Norwegian Refugee Council.

Beledweyne town was the worst affected. Several thousand people were sheltering under trees or in tents.

“Floods have destroyed more than three-quarters of Beledweyne and submerged many surrounding villages,” said Victor Moses, the NRC’s country director.

Aid groups said farms, infrastructure and roads in some areas were destroyed. The destruction of farmland near rivers is expected to contribute to a hunger crisis.

To better prepare for “major climate-induced shocks” such as flooding and drought that Somalia already faces every two to five years, the country and the U.N. Development Program this week launched a $10 million project to expand weather monitoring resources and train a largely rural population in water conservation and flood management.

The possibility of further damage from heavy rains in the coming days remains a concern, according to the International Organization for Migration.

Parts of the Lower Juba, Gedo and Bay regions, where IOM has supported displaced populations for years, have been affected. Many displaced people were stranded without food, latrines or shelter.

“In Baidoa, people have moved to high ground where they are in immediate need of support,” said Nasir Arush, the minister for humanitarian and disaster management for South West State.

Survivors like Sabrie now must struggle to rebuild their lives.

“We’re alive, which I am thankful to Allah for, but this flood disaster wreaked havoc on both our livelihoods and households so I see a tough road ahead of us,” he said from a makeshift shelter built on higher ground outside town.","MOGADISHU, SOMALIA - Ahmed Sabrie woke up to find his house half-submerged in fast-rising flood waters.

At least 200,000 children are among more than half a million people affected by flooding in Somalia, the United Nations children agency said, calling for decisive action to help those at risk of malnutrition and disease outbreak.

In a statement on Tuesday, UNICEF said thousands of families are living in makeshift camps or in the open and are in dire need of clean water, sanitation, safe shelter, health and food supplies.

The UN humanitarian agency said on Wednesday heavy rains have affected 547,000 people in Somalia and displaced 370,000 people.

“Children are very vulnerable in times of emergency,” said UNICEF Somalia Representative Werner Schultink.

“If we do not act decisively, the impact of these floods will be felt in Somalia long after the water levels recede,” he added.

The rains and flooding have destroyed infrastructure and livelihoods in the Horn of Africa nation, according to the UN, which on Monday began delivering vital food packages and supplies to thousands of displaced people.

In the town of Beledweyne, in central Somalia, a river overflowed and at least 10 people died when a boat capsized trying to rescue stranded residents, locals said.

Schools have been forced to shut their doors due to flooding, while the rising waters also caused damage to buildings and widespread disruption.

Education officials said students and teachers have been forced to flee to higher ground where aid agencies are providing life-saving assistance, including shelter, to a quarter of a million people.

“A total of 86 schools have been affected by the floods. Around 700 teachers are also out of work as locals flee to higher ground due to floods in Beledweyne City and surrounding regions,” said Mohamed Osman Elmi, education head of Hiran region.

It is the second flood to affect Beledweyne in less than a year. In 2018, floods forced the Ministry of Education to postpone national examinations.

Somali President Mohamed Abdullahi Farmajo toured the hardest-hit areas earlier this week and promised government support to end recurrent floods such as those that have hit Beledweyne.

”Last year, we witnessed a similar tragedy, we hope this will be the last kind of floods witnessed in Beledweyne. We will work with neighbouring countries and all relevant authorities to mitigate the crisis and ensure our people don’t have to suffer again,” the president said.

Weeks of flooding have destroyed basic infrastructure in the city. Roads have been turned into rivers and farmlands have been destroyed.

The threat of waterborne diseases remains the biggest fear for aid agencies and local authorities. Humanitarian aid has arrived in the town from aid agencies, government and local communities.

East Africa has been experiencing torrential rains which have been exacerbated by a weather phenomenon known as the Indian Ocean Dipole.

Ciraa Farah Ali was asleep when she heard the flood. It was dark, and the 45-year-old mother of seven was alone with her children in her small home in Beledweyne, central Somalia.

She knew the level of the Shabelle River was rising but had little fear that it would burst its banks. Late in October, swollen by unseasonal rains, it did. Ali had no time to gather her belongings and only just managed to escape with her family.

“I could not save a single item from my house. The neighbours came to rescue my children when our house was submerged. My youngest girl was washed away but thanks be to God she was rescued later,” she said.

Not everyone was as lucky.

Nuriya Hassan Ma’ow lost her grandmother, Ruqiya, 75, and her son Mohamud, 11, as the family attempted to flee from the rising flood water in Beledweyne, 200 miles from the capital, Mogadishu. Both were drowned.

“I was not at home. Everybody ran away. We are in disaster and mourning. I don’t know what to do. God will help us,” said Ma’ow, a 37-year-old shop owner. “I have not a house. There is no government assisting us.”

Ma’ow is in a makeshift camp for the displaced in in Ceel Jaale. About 370,000 people have been displaced so far due to flooding, according to the latest UN figures.

Authorities have not yet said how many people died in the flooding, Somalia’s worst in recent history.

Beledweyne was worst hit. Its main hospital was shut after the main wards were inundated. With farmland and roads damaged or destroyed, communities already brought to the brink of disaster by drought and conflict are now threatened by malnutrition and disease.

“This is a catastrophic situation,” said the mayor, Safiyo Sheikh Ali. The Somali president, Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed, who visited the town and waded through submerged areas, called the devastation “beyond our capacity” and pleaded for more help from aid groups.

Parts of the Lower Juba, Gedo and Bay regions have also been affected. Many displaced people were stranded without food, latrines or shelter.

The Somalia NGO Consortium, a coalition of more than 80 humanitarian NGOs, has said the country faces disaster, with as many as 6.3 million people without sufficient supplies of basic foodstuffs.

“The crises occurring within Somalia’s borders are a global responsibility. Climatic shocks are not a local phenomenon but a manifestation of the growing environmental emergency,” said Nasra Ismail, the consortium director.

Efforts attempting to provide food aid have been slowed by continuing rains which shut the airport in Beledweyne to relief flights.

Nur Ali Ebla, 39, said: “I was born in Beledweyne and this is the worst crisis I have ever witnessed. We don’t have shelter as the rains continue to drop on us.

“We have nothing. My husband is disabled and it was terrible when the floods came to our house becase I had to save my children and my husband at once.

“I did not have time to collect our belongings. So now we don’t even have the basics for cooking or preparing food. The flood took everything.”

Abdi Adan Isack, 37, was forced to flee the camp that he has been living in for the past five years to a new one on the outskirts of the city. His home has been destroyed.

“This is a new hardship coming to us. There is no place to return. My house was destroyed by the floods. We don’t have healthcare. My five-year-old son was sick for two days and now he is becoming weak,” Abdi said. “If we don’t get assistance of food and healthcare, this will turn into a famine.”

Habiba Muhumed Ali, 80, who is blind, was rescued last week by a group of volunteers who evacuated 137 survivors by boat from Beledweyne. Seven bodies were also recovered from the water, the Somali Red Crescent Society said.

“I could not see. I thought that I was going to die. Thanks God the boys [volunteers] rescued me,” Habiba said as she sat outside a makeshift house in Ceel Jaale camp. “We need food. We need drinking water. Everything is collapsed. I am scared to return.”

Abdi Abdullahi, who leads Red Crescent operations in Beledweyne, said rescues were continuing with boats and tractors but thousands of people were living in the open.

“Our concern is that another fatal disaster is on its way. We fear the floods could trigger deadly outbreaks of malaria, diarrhoea and other infectious diseases,” Abdullahi said.","It was dark, and the 45-year-old mother of seven was alone with her children in her small home in Beledweyne, central Somalia.

Access to quality drinking water is a big problem in Somalia and other parts of Africa

At least 50 people have died in Somalia after drinking contaminated water from a well in northern Mogadishu, an official in that East African country said Thursday.

Osman Mohamed, the deputy commissioner for Somalia's Yaqshid district, told CNN about the deaths among those who drank from the newly constructed well. More than 150 people who had water from that well were recently hospitalized.

All too often, travellers abruptly find themselves suffering from a gastrointestinal infection. This condition occurs so regularly that it merits its own name: Traveller’s Diarrhea. The culprits are bacteria, protozoa, viruses, and toxins that are transmitted through contaminated food and water, and poor hand hygiene practices.

Food and water-borne illnesses can occur in any country. When we are travelling, we are more likely to be unfamiliar with our food – we won’t always know where it came from, how it was prepared, or who handled it. Some of us are also more inclined to take risks by trying local delicacies and eating from various food vendors. You can prevent gastrointestinal infections when you know the risks, make safe choices, and practice good hygiene. The golden rule is: Boil it, Cook it, Peel it, or Forget it!

Drinking water safety

Always exercise caution with your drinking water. In areas where hygiene and sanitation are challenging to maintain, taking precautions with drinking water is essential.

Is the tap water safe?

Tap water quality and access to clean drinking water varies from region to region. The safety of the drinking water at your destination depends on context-specific factors such as the local supply and distribution system as well as the monitoring and enforcement of water quality standards.

Water quality can be affected by:

Lack of safe water storage

Old pipes or water treatment systems

Poor sanitation infrastructure

Agricultural run-off

Chemical pollutants

Human or animal waste

Weather-related events such as flooding

Even slight changes in water composition can cause Traveller’s Diarrhea. For example, tap water at your destination will have no ill effect on the local population, but due to different treatment standards there may be higher concentrations or unfamiliar strains of E.coli bacteria present. This can cause diarrhea since you do not develop immunity during short-term exposure.

How to prevent water-borne illnesses

Boil your water

If you are unsure about the tap water quality at your destination, bring the water to a rolling boil. Boiling your water destroys pathogens that can cause gastrointestinal infections such as E. coli, Giardia, and Cryptosporidium. Let your water cool in a covered container overnight and pour it into your reusable water bottle before heading out for the day.

Treated water

Water disinfection methods such as filtration, ultraviolet (UV) light and chemical disinfection can be used if there is no heating source to boil water. To learn about different treatment methods, see the following resource:

Bottled water

Bottled water is another option. However, bottles may be outdated or tampered with. Bottled water is also a large contributor to pollution and contributes to the water crisis. If you do purchase bottled water, do so from a reputable source and check that the bottle cap is properly sealed.

Food safety

Always exercise caution when eating high risk foods. Reduce your risk of illness by practicing food safety and following good hand hygiene practices at your destination.

How food becomes contaminated

Exposure to contaminated food is a common source of gastrointestinal illnesses. Before we eat our food, it encounters growers, processors, storage facilities, retailers, and food handlers that can introduce pathogens such as e. coli, Clostridium botulinum, and salmonella. Contamination can also occur through:

Washing food with untreated water

Cross-contamination of raw and cooked items

Improper cooking, storage, and refrigeration

Unsanitary cooking tools and utensils

Poor hand hygiene

How to prevent food-borne illnesses

High risk foods

Due to increased risk of contamination, travellers should practice caution with the following foods:

Undercooked or raw meat, poultry, seafood, fish, and eggs

Unpeeled fruits, vegetables and leafy greens

Unpasteurized dairy products

Foods that have been unrefrigerated or uncovered for a long time such as buffets

Furthermore, it’s not just about what you eat, it’s also important to consider where you eat. It’s not always easy to know if a restaurant or food vendor follows proper food handling and hygienic practices such as properly cleaning cutting boards and utensils, regularly washing their hands, or correctly refrigerating food. Avoid restaurants and food vendors that appear unclean or that don’t have many customers.

Hand hygiene

Hand washing is key to preventing gastrointestinal infections. Inadvertently ingesting fecal matter, protozoa eggs, bacteria or viruses by touching the mouth with dirty or improperly washed hands is a common source of illness. Always ensure that you wash your hands thoroughly before handling food and after using the bathroom.

See the following resources for more information:

Food Allergies

Travelling with a food allergy? Being prepared is important to prevent an allergic reaction or anaphylactic shock during your trip. See the following resources for more information:

Seafood and shellfish poisoning

Marine foods are a common source of food poisoning that can occur in any country due to the availability of these products (fresh or frozen) around the world. See the following resources for more information:

To get to the nearest water supply, Asha walked 31 miles round trip. Once she arrived, she often had to wait in long lines to get the water,or deal with water shortages that left her without enough for cooking and drinking for the day.

Until recently, Asha’s family were pastoralists who raised and herded livestock for survival. After an extreme prolonged drought in 2017, water sources have dried up, livestock are dying in huge numbers, and communities across Somalia are facing a massive hunger crisis. Without sustained levels of large-scale humanitarian assistance, Action Against Hunger has warned that the intensifying drought could deteriorate into famine in Somalia in 2018.

In the Bakool region of southern Somalia, where Asha lives, Action Against Hunger’s recent assessments indicate a severe nutrition emergency: 17.2 percent of displaced children are acutely malnourished. Action Against Hunger’s field teams have also documented extreme water shortages among communities in Bakool, with many people unable to access more than 7.5 liters of water per day, which is the minimum humanitarian standard for survival needs in emergencies.

Prolonged drought killed Asha’s livestock and forced her family to move to Darkenkus village in Bakool in search of water. She has been able to find work by running a small shop. Her family, and many others affected by the drought, receive daily supplies of safe water from Action Against Hunger. With support from the European Union, Action Against Hunger began providing deliveries of clean water by trucks to villages in Bakool in response to extreme water shortages and an outbreak of cholera in early 2017.

This is partly due to a series of severe droughts caused by climate change and the El Nino weather phenomenon.

Somalia suffered from a drought in 2011-2012, which killed over 250,000 people and uprooted millions. Another drought hit the region in 2016, which had a devastating impact on communities and their livelihoods as they ran out of food, water and livestock. By February 2017, 6.2 million people - almost half of Somalia's population - were in need of humanitarian assistance.

It was the worst drought seen in the region in decades. Millions left their homes behind, travelling to humanitarian aid camps in the cities in desperate need of food and water. Their livestock and crops had died, and they had no way to survive.

Most Somali people make their living through animal husbandry. Although the aid camps which have been set up are undoubtedly effective, providing enough water for people to survive on, there is often not enough drinking water for animals. The widespread livestock deaths caused by the drought are not only tragic, they also mean people are falling into even deeper poverty. There is a risk that, unless a sustainable solution to Somalia's water crisis is implemented, these aid camps will become permanent.

Muslim Hands is implementing several on-the-ground solutions to help vulnerable communities cope with Somalia's water crisis.

Case Study: Constructing Community Wells

One such case study can be seen in the Baraako village, just north of Mogadishu. Thousands of internally displaced persons (IDPs) live in the area, and require comprehensive support in rebuilding their lives.



In 2018, our Major Giving team constructed a community well in the village, which extracts water from 34 metres below the ground and includes a hand pump and a pool for livestock. The impact of the project was immediate. It solved the water shortage and water accessibility problems, by providing clean water to around 10,000 people. Waterborne diseases are prevalent in the area, and it is envisioned that, now that people have access to a non-contaminated source of water, overall health will improve.

A community well is functional in all seasons, can be easily maintained by the local community, and provides water for people, livestock and crop irrigation for generations, allowing the area to flourish. Building more solar-powered water wells in Somalia would transform the lives of its most vulnerable communities.

Contact our Major Giving team at majorgiving@muslimhands.org.uk if you would like to donate a large water project like this one.



Case study: Building and Rehabilitating Canals

In 2014, our team identified several areas around the Shabelle and Jubba rivers which were not being irrigated, including large-scale farms and smaller villages. Canals had been built in the area but had not been maintained, resulting in broken regulators, reservoirs filled with silt and sediment, eroded embankments and trees and bushes growing in the canals.

These two rivers systems have traditionally been the 'breadbasket' of Somalia, which is otherwise dominated by an arid or semi-arid landscape. Yet local farmers, attempting to make a living from growing maize, bananas and other crops, could only access the river water through seasonal flooding, and their livelihoods were eroding.

We ensured the rehabilitated canals reached the small farmers in the area as well as larger-scale farms, opening up 230 of land for full irrigation. Moreover, we encouraged nearby farmers to create their own branches from the main canal, thus irrigating at least 1000 hectares (10 square kilometres) of land. The revitalised canal infrastructure is benefitting thousands of local villages, including families who had been displaced by famine and drought in their areas.

The rehabilitation of the canals also improved flood management by regulating and storing flood waters for use in irrigated agriculture, thus reducing the destructive effects of the area's frequent flooding and benefitting the community. The increased crop production will not only expand the local food supply; farmers will sell food to other community and contribute towards making Somalia less economically dependent on humanitarian food distributions.

Thus, interventions like this canal rehabilitation not only transform Somalia's most vulnerable communities and allow rural areas to flourish; they help the entire country progress towards being less reliant on the international community for food and water.

Muslim Hands is running several large-scale water projects to provide Somalia with safe drinking water, including constructing solar-powered deep water wells and boreholes, providing water tankers to IDP camps to help store water during drought, and rehabilitating canals and reservoirs to open up more land to existing water sources.

And from there it would only get worse. 2015 saw the start of a drought still going on today. In fact, since 2011, Somalia has had only one proper rainy season, in 2013, with all other years falling far short of the norm of two rainy seasons per year.

Conflict and displacement prevent us from getting accurate hunger data for Somalia, but there is significant cause for concern. Fighting disrupts access to food, and over 2.6 million people (nearly 20% of the country’s population) are internally displaced, owing to violence, flooding, and food insecurity. Somalia’s child mortality rate of 12.7% is the highest among all countries surveyed in 2019.

One of the significant drivers amid all of this is Somalia’s longstanding history of drought. Let’s take a look at how this climate disaster is becoming the country’s new normal, and how drought in Somalia has left nearly 50% of the country hungry.

2010-11: The worst drought in 60 years…

Situated in the Horn of Africa, Somalia is mostly arid, as monsoon winds lose their moisture by the time they reach the area. However, the drought of 2010-11 was of a different magnitude than those that often come in due to the El Niño weather cycle. It was the worst drought for 60 years and triggered an official declaration of famine.

2012: While lives were saved, an estimated 260,000 were lost

International donors and governments were slow to release funds in response to the famine declaration and this hampered the humanitarian response. While many lives were saved, an estimated 260,000 were lost during the famine between 2010 and 2012. Half of them were children under the age of 5.

Half of all lives lost during the 2010-11 drought were children under the age of 5.

2012-14: Breaking the cycle of crisis-and-response

It’s hard to understate the importance of sustained investments in medium- and long-term interventions to reduce community vulnerability in the face of food insecurity. As countries like Somalia accept that many effects of climate change are irreversible (despite the fact that they often have the least to do with causing climate change). Preventative work is the only way to get out of the cycle of crisis-and-response.

In 2011, Concern began working with farmers to rehabilitate eroded land and implement rainwater harvesting techniques so that disasters, when they strike, are minimized. In 2012, we launched our Farmer Field Schools program. Farmers like Sheikh Muhumed Dhinbil Cumar (who come from 12 or 13 generations of farmers before) were able to cultivate 50% more land, abandoning old staples like the acacia tree and shrub brush in favor of more climate-friendly crops like citrus trees, peanuts, and black-eyed peas.

2015-16: No water, no work

The 2015-16 El Niño events are significant in this context for setting off another period of prolonged drought. In fact, as of this writing, the late 2015 “long rains” was the last rainy season to not fall below average for the country. When the water has come, most of it races off the dry earth rather than soaking into the ground.

For a population that primarily earns money by growing crops or raising sheep, goats, and cows (selling whatever isn’t consumed for survival to cover school books, health clinic bills, and other vital costs), these low rainfalls brought chaos to families already living in extreme poverty.

2016: Seven failures and a nervous wait

In March of 2016, Sheikh Muhumed Dhinbil Cumar and his neighbors waited in anticipation for rain. But once again, for the seventh straight season, their hopes would be dashed by more meager rainfall.

Some preparations were in place: boreholes drilled in places where there were ground reserves, and catchments to save water that would otherwise run away. Concern also began trucking water from boreholes to lined earth pits that, in better times, catch water for remote communities.

But the prolonged absence of adequate rainfall meant that families were still missing meals or eating less in a bid to stretch what they have in an area underserved by public services like education and healthcare. When the rains fail, young men often head to towns and cities in search of jobs. But there aren’t many opportunities for them there, because they haven’t got the right skills. Many leave behind households where a single woman looks after children and older relatives.

Early 2017: The new “worst drought in decades”

By 2017, it was the new “worst drought in decades,” leaving more than half of all Somalis — a staggering 6.7 million — urgently in need of food assistance.

So bad was the situation that the entire Concern Somalia team deducted 10% of their own salaries to support the effort. The money was sent by mobile phone transfers to families in urgent need. Half a million people were at immediate risk for starvation. Staff member Ambar, summed it up quietly and succinctly: “They are our brothers and sisters — how can we not help?”

“They are our brothers and sisters — how can we not help?” — Ibrahim Ambar, Concern Somalia staff member

Fall 2017: “Long rains” do nothing to shorten drought

The much anticipated “long” rains finally arrived at the end of 2017, but they weren’t enough to make a significant difference.

By this point, the drought in Somalia had also brought with it outbreaks of cholera and diarrhea, as well as the worst measles outbreak in years — infecting some 16,000. Under normal circumstances, deaths from these illnesses can be prevented. Dehydration and hunger left many too weak to reach medical centers or fight off infections.

2018-2020: Famine averted, but the crisis continues

Somalia managed to avoid a famine in 2017, thanks to timely intervention and the use of cash transfers to support people through the hungriest months.

However, Somalia continues to struggle on a number of fronts, including the cruel combination of drought and floods. The 2019 rainy season was delayed and then came the devastation of torrential and sustained rainfall which overwhelmed many Somali communities and led to significant loss of life and destruction of property. This kind of rain does not help.

How we help Concern's approach to health & nutrition Ending global extreme poverty requires us to focus on two of its root issues: health & nutrition. Learn More

Currently, 2.2 million Somalis are at crisis or emergency levels of food insecurity, with many households in certain parts of the country still at reduced capacities in terms of crop yields and livestock herds. Many pastoralists with small herds have accumulated substantial debts, and will therefore face large periods of food gaps in the coming months. In mid-2019, the United Nations predicted that Somalia would see a 40% increase in hungry households compared to the beginning of the year.

Funds are desperately needed to roll out infrastructural projects that mitigate the worst effects of the region’s new normal of erratic weather patterns, droughts, floods, uncertain planting dates, and shorter growing periods. Without a long-term commitment that focuses on the root causes of hunger and malnutrition, history can still repeat itself.","Somalia began the decade with the worst drought the region had seen for decades.

95,https://borgenproject.org/water-management-system-in-somalia/,The Need for a Water Management System in Somalia,"Somalia is a South African country frequently plagued by droughts and floods. The nation is currently receiving the bulk of a $45 million assistance from the United Nations’ aid meant to help Ethiopians, Kenyans and Somalis suffering from a major famine caused by the ongoing drought. To break this cycle of famine, an efficient and affordable water management system in Somalia is desperately needed.

Infrastructure Improvement

The majority of Somalis depend on livestock and agriculture for income. Yet, frequent floods and droughts result in a lack of basic necessities, such as food and water. One way to reduce this lack is to implement an intelligent system capable of storing water during floods to preserve it for coming droughts. Reusing greywater, which is water from sources such as sinks and bathtubs, is one efficient way of preserving and reusing water for crops. Somalia thus needs infrastructure development to control floodwater, especially in the construction of aquifers.

Most Somalis live along the Juba and Shabelle Rivers, but many depend on groundwater. Dug wells, boreholes and springs are the most common sources of water. Somalis heavily rely on groundwater, however, it does not provide enough water in times of drought. The Somalian Water and Land Information Management (SWALIM) partnered with the European Union and Somaliland to improve infrastructure, water and land management. Dr. Hjordis Ogendo of the EU Chard d’Affairs said, “Water and land are critical resources for Somali economy and people’s livelihoods but are also extremely vulnerable to natural disasters.”

Floodplains and Groundwater Replenishment

Infrastructure improvements could help mitigate the cost of restoring the land and relocating those who return to destroyed homes. These improvements include through-reservoirs and flood canals that divert water away from farms and homes. Moreover, California farmers have recently begun implementing floodplains and groundwater replenishment strategies. Don Cameron of Terranova Ranch experimented with flooding his 1,000-acre land with water from a river that was high from recent rains.

Cameron was concerned about the amount of water in the reservoir during a long drought after repeatedly digging wells. The replenishment strategy enables water to soak into the ground and collect in an aquifer. As such, Cameron’s grapevines remained unharmed. This began a trend to keep a steady amount of water in the aquifer and above ground.

For Somalis, an affordable method could be as simple as storing water in aquifers to combat future droughts. Therefore, the floodplains and groundwater replenishment strategy presents one prospective Somali water management system that could improve the future outlook of drought mitigation.

Water Desalination Plants

A sophisticated and long-term solution for a water management system in Somalia includes water desalination plants. Although desalination plants are expensive, there are positive and lasting aspects of investing in a single plant. Desalination plants simply transform salt water from the ocean or sea into potable water. Israel currently receives 40 percent of its water from desalination plants. Agriculture accounts for 70 percent of water usage. Since more than 70 percent of Somalis work in the agriculture industry, water availability is crucial.

Future technological advances may reduce the high cost of constructing and operating desalination plants. Saudi Arabia also relies on desalination plants to desalinate seawater. As a semi-arid country, Somalia possesses an environment similar to that of Saudi Arabia. Although comparatively poor, Somalia could opt for desalination plants in the future once technological advances reduce implementation costs.

Future Outlook

With the help of funding a future water management system in Somalia, the need for external aid could be reduced and lead Somalia out of poverty conditions that result from devastating floods and droughts. Desalination plants are an expensive alternative, yet simple solutions such as the construction of aquifers to store floodwater could help millions of Somalis affected by droughts and floods. The implementation depends on the Somali government and its efforts in improving infrastructure. This includes not only managing water during floods and droughts but also reducing poverty by helping the nomadic herders and farmers making up the majority of Somalis.

A new 5,000 cubic metre earth dam near Yombays Village in the Nugaal area of Puntland, Northern Somalia, will bring clean, safe water to over 5,000 people in the area, of which over 4,000 people are from nomadic pastoralist communities. The dam was built by the Puntland Ministry of Environment and Climate Change in collaboration with Yombays Village, with the support of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), and with funding from Global Environment Facility.

Recurrent drought has devastated communities across Puntland, with a prolonged drought from 2016 to 2017 destroying livestock populations and forcing thousands to migrate. The Yombays area has been highlighted as one of the areas most affected by drought, and existing small water structures in the area, called berkedes in Somali, are unable to store sufficient water for the surrounding pastoral and rural communities.

The earth dam, so called because they are built using earth materials and local clay to improve sustainability and stability, was handed over to the Yombays community in early October for their management.

Speaking at the handover of the facility, the Minister of Environment & Climate Change, Hon. Saleban Haji Abdulle, said the earth dam was a cost-effective way to store water and manage environmental resources. “Because of climate change, drought is recurring at a faster rate and with more severity than before. Land degradation and desertification are a result of human consumption, we are not using the environment in a sustainable way. Therefore, we need to use techniques such as this one to protect and conserve the environment and prepare a better future for the coming generations,” he said.

Mr Sayed Sahibzada, Head of UNDP Area Office for Puntland, congratulated the Ministry and Yombays village committee for their success in completing the dam. “The dam is one of a series of dams and water structures UNDP is supporting the Puntland government and communities to build. UNDP is committed to working with government partners and Somali people to build resilience to drought through projects such as this one,” he said.

The UNDP Climate Change Resilience programme has supported the construction and repair of 5 earth and 3 sand dams and repaired over 30 berkedes in Puntland in 2017 and 2018, with funding from the Global Environment Facility (GEF). UNDP continues to work with vulnerable communities across Puntland to improve access to water, address deforestation and desertification, and build long term resilience to climate change.

100,https://theowp.org/reports/kenyas-water-crisis/,The Organization for World Peace,"Millions of people around the world lack access to clean water and sanitation services. Water scarcity causes conflict as people and countries compete for the limited resource. As a water scarce country, over 80% of Kenya is arid or semi-arid land. Kenyans depend on water resources not only for drinking, but also for agriculture, livestock, and fishing. According to Water.org, over 41% of people lack access to safe water in Kenya. Only 9 out of 55 public water service providers (WSPs) have a continuous water supply, leaving people to get water from kiosks, vendors, or illegal connections. Water shortages are common and are made worse by the cycles of floods and drought, population growth, and the unequal distribution of water resources.

Water challenges are mainly felt by people in rural areas and informal urban settlements. Rapid urbanization in Kenya has led to the growth of informal settlements in large cities like Nairobi, but infrastructure has not kept up with the increasing population. WSPs prioritize wealthier communities that can pay, so impoverished residents of informal settlements end up paying private vendors even higher prices for water that does not meet sanitation standards. Nairobi depends on the Ndakaini dam for over 80% of its water supply. However, due to droughts, the water level in Ndakaini has fallen. Earlier this year, this triggered a crisis leading to water rationing. Kenya’s current water supply is at 647 cubic meters per capita annually compared to the recommended threshold of 1,000 cubic meters per capita.

To make sure Kenya can meet its population’s water needs and prevent “water wars”, there needs to be a commitment to long-term investment and maintenance. Kenya’s current water resource situation has contributed to tribal conflicts along the border with Ethiopia, the spread of disease, and trouble for women who are often forced to walk long distances for water, preventing them from finishing school or having a job. Kenya’s water shortage is a silent crisis with the potential to cause conflict if not properly addressed.

There are multiple solutions being used to address the water crisis. Although the government does not have the funds to maintain water pipelines and infrastructure, many non-governmental organizations such as water.org, WaterAid, and TheWaterProject have stepped in. These organizations help with projects like building wells and educating people about sanitation. In early 2018 USAID also helped launch three water and sanitation projects in Kenya. Despite this support, Kenya’s water crisis continues.

Water ATMS began in Nairobi in 2015. Through a public-private partnership between Nairobi Water and Sewerage Company (NWSC), the city’s main water distribution company, and the Danish water engineering company Grundfos. These water vending machines were installed in informal settlements. They allow customers to buy affordable water using smart cards and addresses the availability and distribution issues of informal settlements. With water ATMs, residents of informal settlements no longer must deal with high-priced, unclean water from private vendors. The water vending machines reduce costs for the consumer and will hopefully limit costs for the government as fewer people resort to damaging pipes to steal water. According to Philip Gichuki, NWSC chief, “the project is commercially viable. Illegal water services are going to die off because residents are assured of good water quality.”

One water vending machine is in Mathare, one of the most populous informal settlements. One of the residents, Mary Wangare said, “this is the best project ever that has been started in Mathare. I am now able to access clean water at a low cost and without worrying about its safety.” The water vending machines seem to be successful at making water more accessible and affordable, and by implementing more Water ATMs, more residents could gain water access. However, this solution does not address the inequality of infrastructure in different areas of the city. Residents of informal settlements do not have direct water pipelines to their homes and still must travel for water.

Another solution being implemented by Water.org is the WaterCredit initiative. Water is much more expensive for residents of informal settlements than other city residents. This initiative provides people with small loans for household water and toilet solutions. By using the loan to cover the initial cost, families can have a water system in their home and reduce overall water costs.

There are also large-scale infrastructure investments, such as the Northern Water Collector Tunnel, which is almost complete. It will transfer water from three rivers to Ndakaini to help address Nairobi’s water deficit. While this project may help Nairobi in the short-term, there are concerns about the environmental impacts. Former prime minister Raila Odinga wanted to stop the project, calling it “one of the most disastrous initiatives as it will turn Muranga, Garissa, Ukambani and Tana River Delta regions into deserts, within five years of completion.” There is also concern that this project just involves shifting water from Murang’a county to Nairobi, simply moving the problem. Nkadaini dam is also located in Murang’a county, which recently announced the intention to claim 25% of the revenue collected by Nairobi County from the distribution of water from Ndakaini dam. The Council of Governors resolved this by developing “a benefit-sharing mechanism to ensure residents of Murang’a County benefit from water resources in their own backyard,” according to Governor Kiraitu Murungi. This is an example of the types of disputes that can happen in a country when water is scarce, and resources mismanaged.

Another interesting proposal involves better waste management and resource recovery. In Africa, UN Environment, the African Development Bank and Norwegian non-governmental organization GRID-Arendal have started a project called The Wastewater Management and Sanitation Provision. Wastewater in informal settlements causes sanitation issues, and can also contain nitrogen, potassium and, phosphorus, which can be recovered for agricultural use as fertilizer. Properly managing wastewater could reduce the amount of clean water being used for agriculture and potentially even provide benefits as a fertilizer. According to UN Environment wastewater expert Birguy Lamizana, “wastewater is a very rich soup which can become a health hazard if badly managed or a source from which humans can generate wealth, if well managed.”

With Kenya’s growing population, the water situation will only get worse if action is not taken. They face challenges of poor infrastructure, lack of reliability, poor governance, and little investment. Water distribution and management projects need to be a priority because water and sanitation are major drivers of socio-economic well-being. Luckily there already are many initiatives in place to address the water crisis in Kenya. Right now, all the projects are focused on their own work; it could be beneficial if the water organizations in Kenya coordinated to increase efficiency. Overarching communication between the Kenyan government and non-governmental organizations could ensure that every aspect of water management is thoroughly covered.","Millions of people around the world lack access to clean water and sanitation services.

BACKGROUND

KIWASH

The Kenya Integrated Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (KIWASH) project is a five-year, $50 million investment by the U.S. Government and implemented by USAID. KIWASH works collaboratively across nine counties with county governments, private sector companies and hundreds of communities to improve access to drinking water and adequate sanitation services for more than a million Kenyans.

Kenya RAPID

The Kenya Resilient Arid Lands Partnership for Integrated Development (RAPID) program is implementing an innovative approach to expand access to water and sustainable livestock and rangeland management practices in five northern counties of Garissa, Isiolo, Marsabit, Turkana, and Wajir. The five-year, $35.5 million program, which began in September 2015 works with 21 partners in a public-private partnership. The program seeks to improve and increase water supply availability from 37 percent to more than 50 percent of residents in the five counties. USAID will contribute $12.5 million to the program.

WASH-FIN

The Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene Finance (WASH-FIN) program is a U.S. Government-led initiative coordinated by USAID to close the financing gap for WASH in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia. The event will highlight the need for improving WASH sector performance in order to increase the sources of investment financing required to meet Kenya’s universal access objectives – an issue that continues to impact social and economic development in Kenya – to facilitate water and sanitation projects that will contribute to improving health, livelihoods, and overall economic development in the country.","Last week, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) in collaboration with the Ministry of Water and Irrigation, launched three water and sanitation (WASH) projects in Kenya.

Aberdare, Mt Kenya forests under attack from fires, projects and illegal loggers

The Aberdare Ranges, the second main water tower in the Mt Kenya region, is facing an unprecedented threat from infrastructure development and hundreds of water abstractions by surrounding downstream communities.

Along the edge of the forest, hundreds of trees have been earmarked for felling to pave way for the construction of water and roads projects.

A notable project that will have an effect on the Aberdares ecosystem is the Sh30 billion Mau Mau road which will cut through the Aberdare Forest to connect Murang’a to Naivasha via Nyandarua.

Nobel Laureate Wangari Mathai had vehemently opposed the project over environmental concerns.

During public participation on the construction of the road, it emerged that there will be two tarred sections cutting across the Aberdare Forest in addition to the existing Thika-Magumu highway in Kiambu, which will be expanded to include climbing lanes, eating into more of the forest.

The new sections cutting across the forest will commence from Kigumo and Gatanga constituencies, converging inside the forest to emerge at Njabini Township in Nyandarua County.

Besides this road, Peter Muchiri, Green Future Foundation Kenya director claimed that a road that will connect Nyeri and Nyandarua will cut across the moorland, an extremely fragile ecosystem, and the gazetted Aberdare National Park.

“This area is one of the major water catchment zones and there could subsequently be flooding of developments along the highway corridor,” Muchiri said.

But Dennis Kerengo, Murang’a Kenya Forest Service Conservator disputes that the project will entail destruction of the environment.

Kerongo said there is an agreement with Kenya National Highways Authority (Kenha) that more trees will be planted within the forest or elsewhere to replace those removed during the construction.

“Most of these projects are outside the forest catchment area but a lot of care is taken during the execution not to destroy the ecosystem,” Kerengo said.

James Mukuna of Ndakaini Dam Conservation team also claims that there is a silent destruction of the forested area around Nairobi’s largest water reservoir. Flora and fauna found within Kamweti forest of Mt.Kenya with one of its big rivers whose source is right from the mountain whose scenery tourists enjoy. [File, Standard]

Charcoal kilns

Makuna said areas around Ndakaini Dam previously secured and forested to protect the reservoir, have become popular for logging and charcoal burning.

“The community around the dam planted trees for 17 years. It is demoralising to have the indigenous trees targeted for destruction,” he said.

In the Chuka section of the Mt Kenya Forest in Tharaka Nithi County, 3,500 elders petitioned the National Land Commission (NLC) claiming ownership of 24,000 acres and were awarded 10,000 acres plus a 2,000-acre forest buffer zone but are still waiting for the settlement.

If this excision succeeds, it will be one of the largest official reduction of the Mount Kenya Forest which was designated by Unesco as a Biosphere Reserve and World Heritage Site in 1978 and 1997 respectively. In Nyeri County, the biggest threat to the water towers is forest fires that often break out yearly, decimating forest cover and animal habitat.

Ernest Wang’ombe of Afrika Green Revolution for Sustainable Ecosystems said it is important to note that not all fires are caused by humans as some occur naturally due to dry brush and lightning strikes. “There has been conflict on who starts forest fires usually blamed on honey hunters and arsonists. Other times, it can be caused by nature,” he said.

Wang’ombe advocates the use of natural methods such as planting of fire-resistant plants and trees around areas in the forest that are prone to fires.

Moses Wahome, the Kenya Forest Service Nyeri Ecosystem Conservator said the service continues to train members of the community forest associations as scouts to help in managing the borders of the major forests.

“We have been working closely with the community because our rangers need their support to protect the forests,” he said.

In Meru, illegal logging and other human activities in the Upper Imenti, Lower Imenti and Nyambene Hills forests have been blamed for the reduction in water levels in rivers and other reservoirs.

The Nyambene Forest in northern Meru, which is the source of more than 10 permanent rivers flowing to areas such as Tharaka and Tana, is an important water tower but is under threat from illegal loggers.

There is no food in the markets and where food is available it is no longer affordable. One kilo of maize used to cost 20 Kenyan shillings but now it's 50 Kenyan shillings. Finding food and accessing potable water and pasture is a huge challenge to communities.

Livestock has died and animals are sick and weak. The value of livestock has gone down in the market and there is no longer the same demand as there was because the drought has impacted business. Water sources have started drying up which is creating anxiety and impacting heavily on lives, especially women’s lives and their safety.

Women fear sexual attacks as they search for water

Women are having to trek longer distances to find water, in many cases walking on average nine kilometres or more to find water. Women have said they feel vulnerable to being targeted in sexual attacks. They have also told us that they are no longer going into the forest to collect firewood because they fear sexual attacks. We have heard from women that they are being told if they offer sex they will be able to access the forest for firewood.

Many women are now left to take care of themselves, their children and the elderly. The men have migrated to find pasture and water for the livestock. This makes women vulnerable. There are many protection issues and this drought is impacting the way of life and the family structures.

We have heard from women that they are being told if they offer sex they will be able to access the forest for firewood.

There is pressure on these families and where there are children attending school, girls are being taken out of school to support their mothers and family members.

When a girl is removed from school it will impact her entire life as she may as she may not have the opportunity of returning to school again. Some early marriages have been reported in some caes. This is just one consequence of the drought on girls. Child labour is increasing as children are forced to look for work to help their families.

People are becoming weaker - especially children

Malnutrition levels are increasing – families have exhausted all their coping mechanisms and there is less and less food available. The hunger is visible and the people are becoming weaker, especially the children. Elderly women are also particularly vulnerable because they are often overlooked in emergencies and can become isolated.

ActionAid puts women at the heart of the response

ActionAid believes that we need address the immediate concerns but also to focus on long-term solutions, and women must be at the heart of the humanitarian response. We work with women's groups and community-led disaster committees to ensure the most vulnerable in the communities receive assistance, and the affected communities participate in the response.

When women are at the centre of the response there is a shift in power in processes and decision making. We have also found there is also greater accountability and transparency.

Have you ever thought of what it takes for water to flow when you turn on the tap?

There is definitely a lot of science involved in the process. But the knowledge would amount to nothing, without the people behind the scenes that use it to change lives.

These are the hidden heroes, who are working round the clock each day so as to increase access to clean water for communities, especially now when Kenya is grappling with the COVID-19 pandemic.

Sufficient water makes it possible for children and families to abide by recommended hygiene practices – such as frequent hand washing with soap and water - aimed at preventing COVID-19.

Among the heroes is Kefa Ojwando, a geologist who supervises the drilling team at World Vision in Kenya.

“We are tasked with the responsibility of drilling boreholes and equipping them with pumps, as well as rehabilitating existing ones that may not be functioning optimally. We also put in place infrastructure to harness and purify surface water sourced from springs or rivers. This improves access to clean and safe water for communities,” says Kefa.

His team comprises of a driller, plumber, welder, pump technician, as well as a plant mechanic and electrician.

Within the month of April and May 2020, the team travelled for approximately 400 kilometres - away from Kenya’s Capital city Nairobi - to remote destinations, on their mission of availing clean water to communities in need.

During this period, they traversed various Kenyan Counties characterised with harsh climatic conditions and tough terrains. They included Laikipia, Marsabit, Turkana, West Pokot and Baringo.

“Water plays a significant role in the fight against COVID-19. So communities need water now, more than ever before. This need motivated us to leave our homes and travel to these hard to reach areas,” says Kefa.

Upon arriving at selected sites, which were mostly bushy and deserted, the team would pitch camp and erect tents. This served as their living quarters until intended tasks were completed in a particular area.

""We normally contract community members to prepare our meals. But this time round, we decided to do the cooking on our own so as to observe social distancing which helps to minimise the spread of COVID-19,"" states Kefa.

Despite experiencing extreme weather patterns - ranging from very high temperatures to heavy rainfall that caused floods and landslides in most parts of the country - the team soldiered on, encouraging each other every now and then.

""Many times, our trucks would get stuck in the mud. And we would spend a lot of time trying to pull them out. This would slow down our work. But it never dampened our spirits,"" says Kefa.

""What we dreaded the most was running out of cooking gas and having to look for firewood, especially if it had rained heavily and all the wood was soaking wet,"" adds Kefa.

In the deathly silence of the night, Kefa and his fellow teammates would think of their families and loved ones back home. Despite missing them so much, they got consolation from the purpose of their work.

“We were content that the water projects being undertaken would change lives and bring joy to many families and children facing water challenges in Kenya.”

One of the lowest moments for the team, Kefa narrates, was when the Kenya government banned travel in and out of Nairobi (a hotspot for COVID-19 in the country) so as to contain the spread of the disease.

""We were all worried because we didn't know when or how we were going to travel back to our families in Nairobi, upon completing our tasks.""

Despite these challenges, Kefa notes that the team decided to remain positive and motivated, while putting their trust in God.

Consequently, they managed to successfully inspect and test the water quality of seven boreholes that they had drilled.

They went ahead to connect four boreholes with solar powered pumping systems that will help distribute clean and safe water to many households.

“You can’t ignore the excitement that always comes from the community when they see the water flowing, after we have completed our work,” says Kefa with a beaming smile.

“It’s always heart warming to see the faces of children and families lighting up. We also feel happy knowing that we contributed to the joy and change in their lives.”

Thanks to the support of the drilling team, World Vision was able to enhance access to improved drinking water sources for 186,275 people in Kenya within the last Financial Year (October 2018 to September 2019).","These are the hidden heroes, who are working round the clock each day so as to increase access to clean water for communities, especially now when Kenya is grappling with the COVID-19 pandemic.

Anna is a single mother of seven children eking out a living as a nanny in a neighbouring well-to-do suburb.

Regular handwashing with soap and running water is recommended by the World Health Organization as one of the best ways to prevent the spread of COVID-19. However it is difficult for Anna and her neighbours to put this into practice due to lack of water in slums. Water points, when available, are only in certain locations and are even harder to access when there are restrictions on movement to prevent or contain an outbreak of COVID-19.

There is a high risk that the impacts of COVID-19 on the urban poor living in slums such as Kibera will be considerably higher compared to other areas as maintaining social distancing and enforcement of self-isolation is extremely difficult in overcrowded areas.

Residents often live hand to mouth and staying at home is often not an option.

“Most of us are casual labourers or run small businesses. We must leave our houses to feed our families.,” adds Anna.

To prevent the spread of COVID-19 in slums and informal settlements, the UN family under the leadership of UN-Water, national and local governments, civil society organizations, women and youth groups and community leaders is looking at the following measures:","Anna is a single mother of seven children eking out a living as a nanny in a neighbouring well-to-do suburb.

Daily access to safe and reliable water, sanitation, and hygiene (WaSH) facilities are vital to building healthy and resilient communities. During the COVID-19 pandemic, WaSH services are more essential than ever to help prevent and mitigate the spread of the Novel Coronavirus.

It is for that reason that the Kenyan government has deemed our work there as an essential service. For the last few weeks, our teams in Western Kenya have continued operating while the rest of the country moves into various stages of lockdown and quarantine.

Why? Because a national shortage of health care workers has required expert teams like ours to partner with the government to promote messages of good hygiene across our well-established local networks.

Our teams are taking every precaution to protect their own health and in so doing, the health of the communities they continue to support. They avoid public transportation and travel in small groups. Each staff member has 2 masks that they wear in the field and wash daily, in addition to a pair of gloves. Their work vehicles are stocked daily with gloves, water, soap, and hand sanitizer to enable handwashing throughout their day.

At each community visit, our teams observe social distancing and help the community members to understand and observe the same. We are improvising new ways of marking safe distances for people to wait at busy water points, including using small rock piles and wooden stakes driven into the earth measured 6 feet apart.

To schedule each training, our staff coordinate with the local leadership in each village to ask for permission and approval of a small hygiene training. This helps to encourage those community members who are rightfully wary of any group gathering by explaining that as long as the numbers are kept relatively low, this is a government-sanctioned training.

Our staff have also been given identification badges from the government to be worn at all times during their work, offering another layer of assurance to community members that our staff has specifically been asked to carry out this work.

Upon arrival, our teams have experienced a wide array of reactions from community members ranging from fear to excitement. Some children especially have been put off my staff members’ personal protective gear, thinking the trainers are wearing their gear because they are ill. Throughout the morning, however, the trainers are able to work with the adults and eventually win over the children as they explain they are there to help.

One of the most important messages we repeat is that “Prevention is in our hands”, quite literally. We review the symptoms and prevention of COVID-19, social distancing, and general precautions people can take at the household and community levels in the fight against this disease.

Many attendees have taken to bringing their own chairs so they can comfortably spread out from others at the training. The children can be harder to keep separate as they want to play and see their friends since they have been home from school since mid-March, but the adults incessantly remind them of the importance of distancing.

One of the most important topics covered during these sensitization trainings is proper handwashing technique. We are emphasizing the use of soap over hand sanitizer or bleach, which are harder to acquire locally anyway.

By the end of each training, a new leaky tin or tippy tap handwashing station is established at the community’s water point, whether it is a well, a protected spring, or a water point we are hoping to work on soon. We are asking water users to wash their hands each time before they fetch water.

Another important aspect of training is a large poster we write out in the predominant local language, whether that is Kiswahili, Luhya, or something else, to warn people of the disease and remind them to wash their hands with soap. These signs are made of the widely available plastic sugar sacks and the words are painted on. We then attach these signs directly to the water point’s fence, a nearby tree, or on its own wooden stakes to make sure it is visible to anyone visiting the water point.

These large posters are titled “How to Prevent Corona Infection” and list 5 steps people can take to protect themselves from the virus:

1. Wash hands many times daily using water and soap.

2. Stand two meters from each other.

3. Do not touch the spring’s metal discharge pipe.

4. Do not rub your nose or eyes before washing your hands.

5. Cough or sneeze into your elbow.

In addition, we are providing small handouts that come in 5 different local languages to each household describing the symptoms and prevention of COVID-19. These smaller signs include visual aids in addition to the writing.

With each training, we are reaching a new group of people to have perhaps the most important conversation they will have this year to safeguard the health of themselves, their families, and their communities. We are working to visit as many communities as we can while the government still allows it. We hope you continue to support us in providing this vital service in a time of crisis.","Friday, April 17th, 2020 by Shannon EsrichDaily access to safe and reliable water, sanitation, and hygiene (WaSH) facilities are vital to building healthy and resilient communities.

Water distribution points have been set up to help tens of thousands of Kenyans cope.

For more than two months, Maureen Mkala has taken a narrow alley in Mathare slum in Nairobi to get water for her family, including three children.

She ends up at a crowded water point and it takes her an hour to get 20 liters of water.

""I look for water to clean my hands so that I don’t get the virus. We have a water problem and you are forced to go to the crowded water points to get water,"" she said.

A landslide in April destroyed a major water pipe in central Kenya, cutting off running water to entire Nairobi neighborhoods.

The need for water has increased due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as more people are encouraged to wash their hands regularly to limit the spread of the virus.

Roda Angaya said she is forced to ignore health guidelines in order to get water.

There are many people at the water point, and they are told to keep one-meter distance to limit the spread of coronavirus, Angaya said, questioning how that is possible when everyone is fighting to get the little water that is available.

In central Kenya, engineers are fixing the water line to restore running water supplies, which fell by as much as 20%.

The Nairobi City Water and Sewerage Company said they have reduced the water loss to about 10% and the new line being installed will resolve the shortage.

“There won’t be landslides where we are taking the line through,” said Nashashon Muguna, Managing Director at Nairobi City Water and Sewerage Company. “The line realignment is about 3.4 kilometers. We expect by mid-June we will be through with it. Already, road work has been done on 8 kilometers. So, all the materials can be able to access the site easily.”

For the people of Mathare, and tens of thousands of others forced to collect water during the pandemic, the work cannot be finished soon enough.","NAIROBI - Some parts of Kenya's capital have been without running water for weeks, after a landslide destroyed a water pipe, making frequent hand washing for coronavirus prevention a challenge.

115,https://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/COVID19_RighttoWaterKenya.aspx,COVID19_RighttoWaterKenya,"At the end of 2019, UN Human Rights undertook a pilot assessment of the enjoyment of the right to water in Kenya, focusing on informal settlements in urban centres where there are deep inequalities. The right to water is recognised as being essential for the full enjoyment of life and all human rights. It is defined as the right of everyone to sufficient, safe, acceptable and physically accessible water for personal and domestic uses.

Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6) aims to achieve universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water by 2030. Yet globally, as the UN-Water’s World Water Development Report has highlighted, billions still lack safe water and sanitation facilities and people are being left behind because of discrimination based on gender, ethnicity, culture and socioeconomic status, among others.

The right of all Kenyans to safe and quality water in adequate quantities is enshrined in their Constitution, however, the survey revealed that while urban agglomerations generally have better access to water than rural areas, inequalities in access and affordability are acute for people living in informal settlements.

Handwashing remains a challenge

Kenya has a population of 47.5 million and about 60 per cent of its urban population live in informal settlements, mostly in Nairobi, Mombasa and Kisumu.

With the confirmation of the first case of COVID-19 in Kenya in mid-March 2020, following in the footsteps of the majority of countries across the globe facing the pandemic and the recommendations of WHO, the Government urged the population to adhere to the organization’s directives on handwashing, hygiene and physical distancing. Yet it is difficult to implement these prevention measures in informal settlements where there is limited access to water, no sanitation and physical distancing is nearly impossible.

Only a minority of households in informal settlements have access to the public water supply, which is less costly. In informal settlements, water supply has been privatised by ‘cartels’ and many residents rely on private water vendors, particularly during the dry season.

Water commonly costs less per litre in urban middle class neighbourhoods - where there is piped water - than in informal settlements - where the majority rely on water vendors. For example, the price of piped water in Nairobi is in the range of 34-53 Kenyan Shillings (USD 0.34-0.53) per cubic metre (1000 litres), compared to 10-50 Kenyan Shillings for a 20 litre jerrycan in informal settlements.

The majority of respondents spend over three per cent of monthly household income on water – which is the international standard for affordability. Considering that residents of informal settlements pay up to 50 times the price of water per litre than middle class households, affording more water for frequent handwashing presents an economic challenge.

Further, 35 per cent of respondents to the survey indicated that it took them more that 30 minutes to access water because there are few water points where they live and they have to travel long distances to fetch water. Respondents also indicated a high incidence of water-borne diseases such as cholera in their communities, as a result of contamination because water and sewerage lines are in poor condition.

Many security-related concerns were raised during the survey, mostly by women who sometimes have to pay people to provide security for them when they collect water after dark. “During the daytime, it is really hard because so many people want water, so I usually prefer to fetch water at night. But it’s not that safe because people get robbed,” said one respondent. Others pointed out increased levels of crime when they have to leave their homes unattended to travel long distances to collect water at night.

The right to water, “a question of life and death” according to grassroots defenders

“The Government needs to know that having clean water is our right. They provide clean water to State House so they should also provide clean water to the people of Mathare. We are not lesser people,” said Njeri Mwangi of the Mathare Social Justice Centre.

To implement the survey project, UN Human Rights partnered with a network of 24 Social Justice Centres (SJCs) in Nairobi, Kisumu and Coastal regions. These community-based centres are critical in giving a voice to disadvantaged populations and marginalized groups to illustrate inequalities they face in accessing water, expressing their priorities and shaping the implementation of SDG 6 at the grassroots level.

Since 2017, UN Human Rights has engaged with these Social Justice Centres in Kenya and raised the profile of their work and the human rights issues affecting the urban poor in informal settlements. The project was another opportunity to support these Centres and build the capacity of young grassroots human rights defenders.

“Right now, access to water is not just a basic right, but a question of life and death in the informal settlements, if we are to win this war against the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Wilfred Olal, the national convenor of the Social Justice Centres Working Group. Gacheke Gachihi, coordinator of the Mathare Social Justice Centre, underscored the urgency, saying that a major social emergency was looming. “The threat of the coronavirus is a disaster for the majority of people living in settlements, who have no water, no sanitation and no basic services.” The Social Justice Centres have called on the Government to ensure public water supply to informal settlements.

The UN supports Kenya’s COVID-19 response

Following the analysis of the results of the survey, UN Human Rights made a set of recommendations to national and county governments to reach the targets of SDG 6 for people living in informal settlements and vulnerable communities in Kenya.

These include investing in extending the availability and accessibility of public water supply to informal settlements and vulnerable communities; putting in place regulatory frameworks to ensure the affordability of safe drinking water; investing in water and sanitation infrastructure, noting the close correlation between the rights to water and sanitation, and the right to health.

“The links between the right to water and the right to health could not be clearer at this moment, as Kenya battles the spread of COVID-19. Swift action to ensure access to water will save lives,” said Li Fung, Senior Human Rights Adviser at the Office of the UN Resident Coordinator in Kenya.

Under the leadership of the UN Resident Coordinator, the UN Country Team in Kenya has partnered with the Government to support the COVID-19 response, including in the water and sanitation sector. The Ministry of Water has installed close to 500 handwashing points in Nairobi, including 56 in informal settlements; and the UN has provided soap for distribution and is working to increase water supply to 30,000 people in five informal settlements.

UN Human Rights is continuing its partnership with the Social Justice Centres to monitor the human rights impact of the COVID-19 crisis in informal settlements, and orient response and prevention measures to address the range of risks for vulnerable communities and groups.

Victims suffer from dehydration following bouts of vomiting and diarrhoea in the Tana

Health workers put on alert in flood-prone areas

Seven people were on Sunday admitted to a Malindi hospital after contracting water-borne diseases.

Garsen County representative Masha Boru said the people started to diarrhoea and vomit at night after drinking unclean water from a Tana Delta District river.

“We had to rush the three women and four men to the hospital after their conditions worsened. They were admitted and are undergoing treatment,” Mr Boru said.

The area has experienced heavy flooding recently.

Malindi District Hospital management could not confirm the actual cause of the infection but sources said they had suffered dehydration and were vomiting.

Adequate drugs

Coast provincial director of public health Anisa Omar said last week that health workers had been put on alert to deal with any disease outbreak due to the floods.

The government had stocked adequate drugs to counter any emergency, said Dr Anisa, adding that workers had been sent to assess the situation in the flood-prone areas of Magarini in Kilifi County and Bura-Hola in Tana River County.

Mr Boru said villages most hit include Danisa, Galilee, Duni and Onyongo, all in Garsen Central division.

About 6,000 people had been displaced by the floods by on Sunday according to Tana River County Red Cross coordinator Michael Ayabi.

Mr Boru said the floods begun on Friday when the river suddenly swelled.

“Gradually the water increased and we noticed there was great danger. We mobilised the people to move to higher ground to avoid any catastrophe,” he said on phone on Sunday.

Mr Boru appealed to the government and well-wishers to come to the rescue of the residents with relief supplies.

“We are also calling on Good Samaritans to bring food, blankets, medicine, tents and other needs for the people who are homeless and desperate,” he said.

Several houses were submerged as heavy rains continued pounding the villages.

Flood waters then flow downstream to cause havoc in the lower Tana.

Several families from Matungu District in Kakamega County spent the night in the cold after their homes were submerged in water following heavy rains.

Munami and Khalava villages are worst hit with victims relocating to a church in the neighbourhood while some move in with relatives and friends. At least one house and several toilets were swept away by the raging waters.

“We fear that the problem could deteriorate if the heavy rains continue,” said Mr Gilbert Omoto one of the locals.

A bridge that links Khalava and Harambee market was covered by water leaving residents stranded.

The victims have called on Kakamega County Governor Wycliffe Oparanya to intervene and help them get food, blankets and mosquito nets.","Garsen County representative Masha Boru said the people started to diarrhoea and vomit at night after drinking unclean water from a Tana Delta District river.

The German company Strabag International had decided to suspend work on this future irrigation dam in October 2019 because of a default in payment by the Kenyan central government. The problem is partly solved thanks to the release by Nairobi of 600 million shillings (nearly 6 million dollars).

“We expected to receive 2 billion shillings ($19.7 million) but the government gave us only 600 million shillings, which is not enough to complete the project,” said James Karanja, a Strabag International manager in Kenya.

The Thiba Dam is being built on the Thiba River, 130 km from the capital Nairobi. It will be 40 m high and 1 km-wide. The reservoir will be capable of holding 15 million m³ of water. It will be equipped with a spillway that will prevent flooding during the rainy season.

In the reservoir of the dam, Strabag will install water intakes which, through pipes, will convey the water to irrigation systems. The Kenyan government estimates that this will double the area under rice production, an additional 140,000 tonnes per year. Farmers in central Kenya will thus be able to produce 280,000 tonnes of rice per year. The region is also known for growing products such as maize and vegetables.

The Thiba Dam project, which is part of the Mwea Irrigation Scheme, was expected to be completed 45 months after inception. It will require an investment of 19 billion shillings, over $186 million. Kenya’s central government is funding the project with support from the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA).

119,https://www.worldbank.org/en/about/partners/brief/kenya-using-private-financing-to-improve-water-services,Kenya: Using Private Financing to Improve Water Services,"Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals to end extreme poverty by 2030 will require about $4.5 trillion annually, far more than multilateral development banks or donors can provide by themselves. To face this challenge, the World Bank Group adopted the MFD approach, which entails working with governments to crowd in the private sector while optimizing the use of scarce public resources. This approach is guided by the Hamburg Principles adopted by the G20 in 2017 and builds on the substantial experience across the institution.



Kenya’s national development plan seeks to make basic water and sanitation available to all by 2030. Building on Kenya’s utilities reforms that started in 2002, the World Bank Group and other development partners supported the country through a series of measures from 2007 to 2017 that has successfully attracted private financing of $25 million. The combined effort built up critical water assets and directed commercial funding to expand access to water and sanitation services, including in rural and low-income areas.

Development Challenge

Kenya, with water resources of around 500 cubic meters per person, is a water-poor country. The water stress level is likely to increase substantially with rapid population growth, urbanization, industrialization, and climate change. Achieving universal access to safe water requires an estimated $14 billion in investment in water supply over the next 15 years. Given that development partners now contribute more than half of financing, an increase in mobilizing new sources of financing, including commercial financing for commercially viable investments, is required.

The MFD Approach

The Kenyan government decided to mobilize commercial financing to help bridge the financing gap for investments in water infrastructure. The World Bank Group and international development partners helped scale up the financial and operational performance of water service providers, supported creditworthiness assessments, and piloted financing initiatives focused on delivering improved water supply and sanitation services to low-income homes.

Setting Up the Regulatory and Institutional Framework

Kenya’s Water Act of 2002 introduced important reforms in the sector that improved governance, operational efficiency, and retained revenues within the sector for reinvestment. The Water Services Regulatory Board followed up with utilities tariff reform in 2009. Following decentralization of the sector, the Water Act of 2016 was passed to align the sector with the provisions of Kenya’s 2010 Constitution, which retains provisions for debt financing for investment.

Building on the 2009 tariff reform led by the water regulator, the World Bank Group worked with utilities to develop ways to finance new infrastructure with their own revenues on a sustainable basis. This involved earmarking surplus revenues to improve water assets. A revenue-backed lending structure, through which utilities would be able to borrow against future surplus revenues, was developed with technical support. IFC and a local bank were involved in loan appraisals, and while private financing did not initially materialize due to uncertainty over the ownership of assets and cash flows, this initial work outlined and demonstrated a model for future financing activities.

The World Bank Group and its development partners supported several initiatives to improve the creditworthiness of water utilities and increase access to commercial debt. These included the first two credit rankings of Kenyan utilities in 2011 and 2015, a process that is now handled by the country’s water regulatory board and forms part of its utility monitoring statistics.

Commercial Financing Initiatives for Water Utilities

In addition to creditworthiness assessments, technical assistance to borrowers and lenders for project pipeline development and implementation has facilitated the flow of commercial financing, with support from multidonor World Bank Group trust funds—including PPIAF, GPOBA, and the Water and Sanitation Program.

In 2007, the World Bank launched a pilot program with K-Rep Bank, a Kenyan microfinance bank, to help rural and peri-urban communities access loan financing for improving and expanding small piped-water systems. Technical assistance was provided to develop bankable loan applications and supervise project implementation. In 2010, the program was scaled up with support from the European Union. The World Bank leveraged IFC’s expertise on client assessment prior to tapping funds from the GPOBA’s water facility.

Another pilot that started in 2013 has been scaled up into a utility financing facility. The World Bank, through GPOBA, has provided $21 million of results-based grants to help water service providers obtain commercial funds for delivering water services to low-income areas. These projects have already provided water access to over 300,000 people, with another 200,000 expected to benefit by the time the last project closes in December 2019.

Making a Difference

As of 2018, approximately 50 transactions have been completed, which raised more than $25 million in private capital, including a $6 million loan to Nairobi City Water and Sanitation Company. The experience demonstrates an emerging project pipeline and growing appetite among utilities for blended financing to bridge the investment gap. Utilities are gaining experience in executing commercially bankable projects, and there is growing interest among local banks to lend to the water sector, with four banks now actively participating, and others looking to enter the market.

The U.S. Agency for International Development’s Development Credit Authority supported many of these loans through credit guarantees that provided partial risk cover to domestic lenders. These efforts directly complement the Dutch-funded Kenya Pooled Water Fund, which is planning to pool together assets to issue larger, risk-diversified private bonds.","The combined effort built up critical water assets and directed commercial funding to expand access to water and sanitation services, including in rural and low-income areas.

It's not a distant danger. It's real, it’s now, and it’s affecting thousands of people. Throughout Kenya, climate change has brought everything from major droughts in Ewaso N’giro to devastating floods in Embu. However, the most damaging impact of climate change is the looming dark cloud that is prevalent every day: uncertainty.

Uncertainty may sound exhilarating for some, but not for a farmer in Nanyuki who doesn’t know if he’ll get enough water for his maize this year. Or a child in Kisumu who depends on that farmer’s success in order to eat next month. For hundreds of years, families in East Africa have relied on the consistency of the rainy seasons for agricultural production. Rainfed agriculture is the pillar of economic development in East Africa. As climate change brings more variability and more extreme weather events, it also brings hunger, destroyed livelihoods, and the threat of conflict.

The devastation does not stop there. Severe drought episodes will not only lead to widespread famine but will also increase community conflicts driven by competition for scarce water and pasture resources. On the other end of the spectrum, the danger to human safety from floods is just the initial impact. Flooding also increases conflict with wildlife and results in more incidences of water borne diseases.

So, what can we do? To combat the uncertainty that climate change brings, we need to be both the most hopeful optimists and the most pragmatic pessimists. We must be proactive and plan for the long-term by setting lofty, coordinated goals to reduce emissions and curtail global temperature increases, of course. But we must also simultaneously react to the current situation in real-time. At the local scale, we must work with communities to immediately increase adaptation capacity to deal with the contextual changes that are already happening and will continue to happen.

The first step to fostering immediate resilience is to empower people in the impacted communities. How? By creating tools that turn data into knowledge and knowledge into practice. As part of the Kenya Water Security and Climate Resilience Program, RTI International is working directly with the Kenya Water Resources Authority (WRA) and the Kenya Meteorological Department (KMD) to produce seasonal water supply forecasts for the entire country. This includes drought forecasts, medium- to short-term flood forecasts for flood-prone basins, and a real-time basin monitoring system.

The seasonal water supply forecasting system generates a weekly report about the total water volume throughout the country over the next 9 months. This information can then be easily disseminated to the public for planning purposes. Farmers can use it make decisions about what types of crops to plant to maximize agricultural production or anticipate droughts; communities can plan their water storage to maximize water security; and we can have a better understanding of the long-term trends expected to continue throughout Kenya.

The short-term flood forecasting system and the real-time basin monitoring system allow for authorities to quickly access the state of reservoirs, dams, and rivers to provide important information such as current flows and flood warnings to the general public. Pilot SMS alert notifications are being developed to directly warn people who might be in danger. Early awareness of large rainfall events allows the Government of Kenya to mobilize resources and optimally operate reservoirs for flood protection.

It all comes back to the battle against uncertainty. We might not know exactly what climate change will bring in the next 10, 50, or 500 years, but we can translate hydrologic data into actionable decisions to mitigate as much uncertainty as possible. We can help the farmer better plan his cropping schedule. We can help the people in flood zones evacuate their families in time. And we can help avoid conflict by providing knowledge about upcoming droughts and water stress. RTI is proud to work hand in hand with WRA and KMD to increase Kenya’s water security and climate resiliency.

For four days, water sector experts from across the continent and around the world will discuss the policies to be implemented to limit the risks associated with water use on the continent.

Some of the objectives set by the organisers of this congress include the following:

– Sharing best practices on the efficient use of water resources to improve water security in and outside Africa;

– Reflecting on the strengths, weaknesses and lessons learned in water financing in Africa and globally;

– The development of tools to build the capacity of stakeholders in the sector;

– The launch of a programme for the protection of water resources in Africa…

During this congress, participants will benefit from plenary sessions, field visits and BtoB meetings. In addition, training sessions on water management will also be offered to participants. A fair for young water professionals is also planned to be held on the 26th of April 2020, as a prelude to the congress.

This international meeting will bring together leaders, local officials, heads of international financial institutions and members of civil society. The meeting will focus on the mechanisms to be implemented to protect the resources of the African continent, which are threatened by water stress in several localities. In 2050, the African population will reach 2.5 billion people, which will mechanically lead to an increase in the demand for water. In 5 years time, 25 of the 48 countries in the world facing water shortages could be African, representing nearly 690 million Africans who could be deprived of water.

The conference is being organised by the Kenyan government in partnership with the Nairobi City Water and Sewerage Company and The Nature Conservancy (an environmental conservation organisation founded in the United States in 1951). It is being held as a prelude to the 9th World Water Forum to be held in Dakar, Senegal in 2021.

The biggest challenges they faced in their first months here was getting sick from the food and water. This led me to wonder, is the water in Kenya safe to drink for tourists and foreigners? I did some research and drew from my personal experience to write the following post.

Only bottled water from popular brands is safe to drink for tourists and foreigners. This is because the quality of tap water in Kenya is inconsistent and should not be trusted for drinking unless it is boiled. In this article, I will share my experiences with water in Kenya and help you choose safe water sources that you can use when you visit this beautiful country.

Why you should only use bottled water

While many parts of Kenya have tap water that is supplied by county water and sanitation companies, most of this water is may not have the purity levels required to consistently protect you from stomach infections. The quality of the water supply is usually inconsistent with the rainy season having the water with the most contamination.

Where should I buy water in Kenya

When buying water in Kenya, get it from a mid-sized or large supermarket. This will help you avoid counterfeit and substandard brands that do not take their water filtration process seriously.

Not all bottled water is safe

In addition to this, you need to ensure that the brand of water you’re buying is a popular one. There are a number of reputable bottled water brands that you can choose from in here are the ones I would personally recommend:

Dasani Keringet Highlands Aquaclear Quencher Aquamist

These brands have been in operation for a number of decades now and adhere strictly to the guidelines of the Kenya Bureau of standards for water purity levels. (As a side note I am not receiving any compensation from mentioning these brands. I personally use many of these brands and would recommend them to anyone)

How much does bottled water cost in Kenya

A 1-Liter bottle of water in Nairobi costs y about 60 shillings at the time of writing this article. This translates to around $0.50 USD. A 10-Liter of water will cost you about 500 shillings which is roughly around $5.



Is tap water in Kenya safe to drink?

Tap water in some locations is safe to drink but the quality of water in most places in Kenya is so inconsistent that my advice would be to avoid it completely. inconsistent.

Treat all water with suspicion when in Kenya

There are places where the water is pristine and clean on one day but murky and brown another day. This especially happens in the rainy season. I went to college in a town where, once it rained, the water would turn brown. This was because the water went through very little filtration before it was piped.

Is tap water safe to shower?

I personally consider the water in taps safe enough to shower with. It’s usually filtered enough for it to be safe. However, if you feel that you need extra protection, you can use antibacterial soap when showering. However, I think this is overkill and not required.

How safe is Mombasa’s water

Mombasa gets most of its water from boreholes in the nearby Baricho Aquifer. This makes the water taste weird. The first time I had water in Mombasa, I couldn’t quench my thirst. It’s full of minerals and this makes the water taste bland. In addition to this, I am not very sure how good the water treatment is so you probably don’t want to be drinking it anyway.

If you are going to the coast of Kenya, plan to get a Supply of bottled water from the brands I mentioned above. You can get them from supermarkets in the coast you don’t have to carry it from Nairobi.

How safe is Nairobi’s Water

Nairobi has better tasting water than Mombasa. This is because the water is sourced from streams and rivers originating in the Aberdare Ranges. Just in case you are curious, Nairobi sources it’s water from Ndakaini Dam near the Aberdare Ranges.

While the water in Nairobi may be better treated and that of other towns and localities in Kenya, I’ll still say that it is unsafe for any foreigner to drink it straight from the tap.

Is water in Kenyan Hotels Safe

Most upmarket hotels, which is where you’re most likely to be staying if you are a tourist in Kenya, have in-house water filtration systems that make the water safe enough to drink from the tap. However, I would advise that you confirm from the hotel staff if the water is safe to drink before doing so.

Is the water in Kenyan swimming pools safe?

More swimming pools in Kenya have water that has been chlorinated and this makes the water safe to swim in. the water, ordinarily, comes from normal tap water and so this extra step of chlorination enhances the purity of the water and remove any contamination brought in by the swimmers.

When choosing a swimming pool, check to see if it is well maintained and make an enquiry on when they get their water just to be safe.



Can I use the water in Kenya to brush my teeth?

I’ve seen a number of reviews indicating that Kenyan water is not safe enough to even brush your teeth mean but I think this is taking it a bit too far. as long as the water does not have any clear signs of contamination I would be ok with brushing my teeth with it.

The best way of carrying drinking water in Kenya

Since you’re going to be carrying all of your drinking water with you, you need to have a solid plan on how you intend to move the water around especially if you’re going to be going to a remote area in Kenya.

If you’re going to spend most of your time in the Urban areas like Nairobi or Mombasa, get a 5l pack of bottled water from the supermarket and pour it into your smaller portable water bottle for day-to-day use. if you’re traveling with a tour company, they will have already organized for this but it helps to confirm before starting your journey.

If you’re going to a remote part of Kenya that does not have easy access to supermarkets it helps to carry a portable water filter bottle with you. These are able to filter water from suspect sources and ensure that you don’t drink any bacteria or contamination. I have never used one myself but I found the LifeStraw Go Water Filter Bottles on Amazon with particularly high reviews and I thought it would be helpful to share it. You can check it out and see for yourself.

Having this filtration bottle may not be enough though if you’re going to be in a very Remote Part of Kenya and you will need to make arrangements with the organizer to find out what kind of water sources they have and make a plan on how you going to be hydrated when there. in the worst case scenario where you do not have any water from sources that you can trust your best bet would be to boil it. This is the universal way of ensuring that your water is pure and safe and it’s what many Kenyans use when they don’t have access to bottled water or other filtration mechanisms.

How to get safe and pure water as an Expatriate or long-term visitor in Kenya.

If you’re planning to stay in Kenya for a longer period of time than just a few days, using bottled water for all your drinking needs may not be very feasible. as I mentioned earlier a 10 Liter Bottle of water will cost roughly around $5 USD. buying water like this for a long period of time can add up to a lot and there are better ways of achieving clean and safe water without it breaking your bank account.

The best way of getting permanent clean and filtered water in your home in Kenya as an Expatriate or foreign visitor is by installing a sink filtration system that filters and purifies the water before it pours out from your tap. the Kenyan company that is most popular for installing the systems is Davis and shirtliff and you can check out their website here. (They are not paying me to say this, I just think they are a company that is worth recommending based on the level of professionalism they have handled me with when interacting with him).

2011-01-18

Damaris E. Mateche, Environmental Security Programme, ISS Nairobi Images of livestock carcasses, anguished faces of the elderly, despaired women and children left behind at home as the men move in search of water and pasture while the drought scourge bites…these are the images Kenyan have been seeing in the local media. This is happening in the North Eastern and Eastern regions, parts of the Rift Valley, as well as the Coastal areas of Kenya. The story of drought and famine is almost becoming a cliché in Kenya. Despite the existing drought early warning systems in the country, drought disaster response mechanisms and coping strategies remain miserably wanting. More often, drought and famine situations degenerate into dire humanitarian crises before the government takes substantial action.



The drought cycle in Kenya dates back to more than three decades ago. In 1975, widespread drought affected 16 000 people, in 1977 it was 20 000 people affected, in 1980, 40 000 people suffered the effects of drought, and in 1983/84 it hit over 200 000 people. In 1991/92 in Arid and Semi-Arid Districts of North Eastern Kenya, the Rift Valley, Eastern and Coastal Provinces, 1.5 million people were affected by drought. It was reported that widespread drought affected 1.4 million people in 1995/96 and in 1999/2000, famine affected close to 4.4 million people. In 2004, 3 million people were in dire need of relief aid for eight months from August2004-March 2005 due towidespread drought. The drought in 2008 affected 1.4 million people. In the late 2009 and early 2010, 10 million people were at risk of hunger after harvests failed due to drought.



From the aforesaid it is evident that Kenya has been hit by repeated droughts. The drought cycle has become shorter, with droughts becoming more frequent and intense due to global climate change and environmental degradation. The cycle has reduced over the years, from every ten years, down to every five years, further down to every 2-3 years, and currently every year is characterized by some dry spell. For the communities living in arid and semi arid areas of the country, drought wasn’t a new thing to cope with in earlier years. The people were used to experiencing drought every 10 years or 5 years. This cycle allowed farmers to recover and rebuild their livestock and crops before the next drought. This is not the case anymore. The time for recovery, for rebuilding stocks of food and livestock is becoming shorter every year.



It is also worth noting that the arid lands communities in the past had devised their own drought coping and adaptation strategies. Those strategies are no longer effective enough to cope and adapt to drought. One reason is that the drought intensity and frequencies have increased and the people’s predicament has been compounded by political marginalization and chronic underdevelopment, including lack of basic education, infrastructure and health, thereby greatly reducing their capacity to adapt. Thus, they are left at the mercy of the government and relief agencies.



Once again the drought is here. As it always happens, Kenyans are again caught unprepared as a nation. Whether it is out of overall ineptitude or utter callousness is a topic for future debate. This time around, however, unlike the drought between 2007-2008 when the whole country was in dire need for food, the Ministry of Agriculture has assured the country that there are food stocks to last eight months. Images of livestock carcasses, anguished faces of the elderly, despaired women and children left behind at home as the men move in search of water and pasture while the drought scourge bites…these are the images Kenyan have been seeing in the local media. This is happening in the North Eastern and Eastern regions, parts of the Rift Valley, as well as the Coastal areas of Kenya. The story of drought and famine is almost becoming a cliché in Kenya. Despite the existing drought early warning systems in the country, drought disaster response mechanisms and coping strategies remain miserably wanting. More often, drought and famine situations degenerate into dire humanitarian crises before the government takes substantial action.The drought cycle in Kenya dates back to more than three decades ago. In 1975, widespread drought affected 16 000 people, in 1977 it was 20 000 people affected, in 1980, 40 000 people suffered the effects of drought, and in 1983/84 it hit over 200 000 people. In 1991/92 in Arid and Semi-Arid Districts of North Eastern Kenya, the Rift Valley, Eastern and Coastal Provinces, 1.5 million people were affected by drought. It was reported that widespread drought affected 1.4 million people in 1995/96 and in 1999/2000, famine affected close to 4.4 million people. In 2004, 3 million people were in dire need of relief aid for eight months from August2004-March 2005 due towidespread drought. The drought in 2008 affected 1.4 million people. In the late 2009 and early 2010, 10 million people were at risk of hunger after harvests failed due to drought.From the aforesaid it is evident that Kenya has been hit by repeated droughts. The drought cycle has become shorter, with droughts becoming more frequent and intense due to global climate change and environmental degradation. The cycle has reduced over the years, from every ten years, down to every five years, further down to every 2-3 years, and currently every year is characterized by some dry spell.

This time around, however, unlike the drought between 2007-2008 when the whole country was in dire need for food, the Ministry of Agriculture has assured the country that there are food stocks to last eight months.

According to the Crisis Response Centre of the Ministry for Special Programmes, we are informed that contingency measures were put in place following drought forecasts by the Kenya Meteorological Department in 2010. The challenge remains for the government to deliver the required food to the drought-stricken areas in time. Even though the government guarantees food security for eight months, the issue is, after that, does the government have a set contingency plan for food security given the known drought cycle?



Food aside, with drought, conflict over water and pastures is likely to continue in the arid areas. This is fuelled by proliferation of small arms into the country from neighboring countries. According to the Arid Lands Resource Management Project Coordinator, Mr. Molu Sora, fears of conflict are already high as desperate herders move away from their traditional grazing lands, converging and congesting the few areas that still have water and pasture. As if that is not enough, with water scarcity, chances of cholera outbreaks are quite high.



Livestock, a main source of livelihood for pastoralist communities has not been spared either. The Ministry of Livestock Development recently announced that more than 150,000 camels, 16 million goats and 6 million cattle risk death as harsh weather conditions ravage most parts of Kenya’s arid and semi-arid lands. The livestock purchase off-take programme was a good initiative by the government, both as an emergency intervention and as a coping strategy. However, with alarming livestock death reports already, this approach might not rescue the situation as it is now. The purchase should have begun immediately the signs of drought start manifesting instead of waiting for livestock death reports before action is taken. In the current situation, the animals to be sold off are either too weak to reach market centers or are not healthy enough to fetch good market prices. For instance, it is reported in the local dailies that the price of a full-grown bull has gone down to Ksh. 3,000 from Ksh. 15,000 six months ago. The Kenya Livestock Marketing Council estimates that farmers will incur losses of upto Ksh. 229 billion from the drought.



Certainly, there are still challenges in the implementation of drought disaster responses. Even with clearly spelled out roles of the existing institutional structures as it is outlined in the 2009 Draft National Policy for Disaster Management. Most of the response activities are focused on immediate emergency interventions, such as water trucking and destocking. This gives little time for adequate emphasis on long-term measures. Another challenge is that the budgetary allocation for overall disaster management is far less than the reasonable amount needed. Thus, drought disaster response activities are hampered by inadequate resources allocation. The biggest setback faced by Kenya like many other African countries, is lack of forward planning and inadequate response to crises. On the other hand, data and relevant information (weather forecasts, drought trend analysis) is adequate and available. This is a resource that can be used in more sustainable drought management. Unless action is taken, drought will always be a disaster in waiting which will negatively impact on any significant development that the Kenyan government may undertake.","Despite the existing drought early warning systems in the country, drought disaster response mechanisms and coping strategies remain miserably wanting.

With three consecutive rains failed in his county, 51-year-old Harrison Kazungu Karisa became increasingly concerned. The poor rains resulted in drier conditions, reduced pasture and limited water resources. The beginning of a drought was evident and would have devastating consequences for his main way of making a living - livestock.

Drought is a recurring hazard in Kenya, with various degrees of intensity and frequency across the country. Evidence suggests climate change may be driving an increase in intensity and frequency of drought events. Most recently the lack of rainfall has fuelled a worsening food crisis, with over 2.6 million people classified as food insecure.

In the case of Kenya, FAO alongside the National Drought Management Authority established an Early Warning Early Action (EWEA) system in mid-2016 to mitigate drought. The system takes a new approach to crises and focuses on early actions that could be taken to mitigate or prevent the impact of hazards before they strike.

With the system in place, in early November 2016 signs of drought were detected through a range of indicators including rainfall, vegetation indexes, and livestock conditions among others. This alerted FAO to act. To respond to this early warning, the newly established FAO Early Action Fund released USD 400 000 to protect livestock of vulnerable communities in identified high-risk areas.

To protect his key breeding stock, Harrison was assisted through FAO’s Early Action Emergency Livestock Feed Programme. The project provided supplementary feed, health treatments and livestock market management actions in Kilifi, Kwale, Marsabit and Wajir counties. The programme reached over 12 800 households.

Harrison received nutritional blocks and supplementary feed from FAO. Before the feed was distributed, Harrison began purchasing grass from “far flung areas such as Kaloleni, which had some grass reserves. At a certain point, I even had to pluck leaves from the bush, stack in a sack and carry them back for the cattle to eat as we had totally run out of grass”. However, as even these reserves depleted and the drought intensified, Harrison realized “this was a huge problem, but luckily I received a phone call advising me to go to the local government office to take part in this project”.

Harrison owns five cows and during the peak of the drought he managed to keep all his livestock alive, thanks to the preventive measures. The supplies provided much needed support to Harrison: “The livestock feed helped me tremendously. Now if you look at my cattle they are very healthy. I usually mix the food with plain grass, then feed the cattle, together with some water. This has helped them gain weight. There is also potential for me to have calves as well; prior to the feed, the cows were unable to breed”.

Since receiving the feed, Harrison’s cows have also increased their milk production: “at the moment, my cows are producing nine litres per day. Their milk levels had started to drop due to the drought conditions to an extent that each cow would produce a single litre. Now there is significant improvement”. He now makes a steady income from the milk charging Ksh. 50 (USD 0.50) for one litre – he has resisted over-inflating his prices, as the price of milk has increased during the drought, as he would like to support other vulnerable households and keep his community healthy.

With seven children and three of them in secondary school, the income from the milk has also provided much needed economic relief to the family. Harrison would “borrow money from a micro financial institution to pay their school fees and then use the monthly sales from my milk to repay. It has helped me a lot”.

By acting early and safeguarding Harrison’s stock, he was able to maintain the health of all his cattle and continue to sell and trade during the peak of the drought. While drought continues in Kenya, Harrison’s story highlights the importance of acting early. FAO recognised the need to take action before a crisis escalates into an emergency and such action is a wise investment. Stepping in early to take action builds resilience and reduces both disaster losses and the costs of emergency response.","Easing the impact of drought in Kenya – Harrison’s storyWith three consecutive rains failed in his county, 51-year-old Harrison Kazungu Karisa became increasingly concerned.

With their crops and livestock devastated by drought, Kamal’s family had no choice but to leave and try their luck in a new country.

Kamal was lucky. Unlike many children who died along the way, he made it across the Kenyan border, and is now living in Dolow, near Ethiopia.

But there, too, the situation is desperate.

* Not his real name. Name has been changed to protect his privacy.

After two years of below-normal rainfall, the Horn of Africa has been hit with the worst drought in over half a century. Almost 12.5 million people are in urgent need of humanitarian assistance.

In some regions of Kenya , as a result of low rainfall and high food prices, some 3.5 million people do not have access to adequate food. Acute malnutrition has reached 37% in parts of northeast Kenya.

, approximately, 510,000 people are in Phase 3 (Crisis) and 700,000 people in Phase 4 (Emergency) of the Integrated Phase Classification, which describes the severity of food emergencies (Phase 5 is Famine). In Ethiopia, despite enhanced rainfall during April and May, food security continues to deteriorate, particularly in southern and southeastern pastoral areas. An estimated 7.8 million people require humanitarian assistance.

The impact of drought goes far beyond hunger

In addition to hunger, the drought has resulted in massive displacement, impacted education and led to an increase in child labor. The effects of drought are exacerbated by conflict in the region and can lead to repeated displacement, deaths, increased vulnerability to harmful practices like FGM, loss of education, increased exposure to risks such as recruitment into the armed groups, etc.

In Somalia, 714,000 people have been displaced because of the drought since November 2016. Intense fighting reported in the same period caused the further displacement of over 15,000 people.

In Ethiopia, more than 843,000 people remain displaced due to drought and conflict in the Gambella region.

In Kenya, over 41,000 people are displaced due to conflict, drought and floods.

In Somalia, 79,807 children are out of school; at least 175 schools are closed in Ethiopia; and in Kenya about 175,000 children are not attending schools as a direct result of the drought. Heightened insecurity due to conflict in northeastern parts of Kenya has caused non-local teachers to flee leading to the closure of over 18 schools.

The school dropout rate is increasing as negative coping mechanisms are being adopted, including children having to help their families search for water, or to seek work to be able to buy food.

In Kenya an estimated 175,655 people – including 139,000 children – are at risk of violence, abuse and exploitation; 122,655 are at risk of gender-based violence.

A sharp increase of children living on the streets has been reported in Kenya, leading to a rise in child labor in urban centers.

Risks to children’s safety increase during humanitarian crises

There is much evidence to suggest that children are more vulnerable to inadequate care, abuse, exploitation and neglect during humanitarian crises. Discriminatory attitudes and practices that existed prior to the emergency often intensify, and children are excluded from life-saving child protection services or information due to their gender, age, ethnicity, sexual orientation or disability.

They are at risk of recruitment into armed forces and groups, sexual violence, separation from their families, psychosocial distress, trafficking and economic exploitation. They face genocide, physical violence, killing and maiming, and other forms of harm.

Family separation and the breakdown of national and community-based child protection systems make girls and boys especially vulnerable to abuse, exploitation, violence and neglect.

Child protection in emergencies

Because of children’s increased vulnerabilities in emergencies, a robust child protection system is critical. However, child protection services, including security, justice and social services, are often weakened in an emergency, which can result in an environment rife with violations against children.

Child protection in emergencies (CPiE) refers to all efforts to prevent and respond to abuse, neglect, exploitation, and violence against children in the aftermath of a disaster. It includes, as a first step, guaranteeing that children receive all the necessary humanitarian assistance that is required for their safety and well-being. CPiE prioritizes the fulfilment of certain rights for children in emergencies, namely those that protect children against maltreatment and ensure their survival and well-being.

Assisting children in the context of an emergency has to be done through careful interventions, which address both their immediate needs and protect them from long-term harm. CPiE is a multi-sectoral area of work involving many actors. As such, we all need to be prepared to act, and equipped with the necessary resources that enable us to provide an effective and a well-rounded response.

ChildFund responds to the crisis in the Horn of Africa

ChildFund is responding to the drought emergency in the Horn of Africa.

In addition, in my role as ChildFund Alliance’s rapid response consultant, I’m currently in Kenya training the government, partners and other stakeholders to strengthen coordination and information management for child protection.

As a result of this work:

CPiE messages have been disseminated to over 50,000 listeners through local radio stations in Kenya to prevent family separation and exploitation of children.

Community child-friendly spaces or areas for children and youth have been set up, and interim care services provided for children.

Community-based monitoring, reporting and response to the needs of children, adolescent girls and women survivors of abuse and exploitation, including gender-based violence that is often not reported, have been established.

Follow-up visits are being conducted for children who have been reunited to ensure they are cared for and protected.

Cases are being identified and referred to relevant service providers.

The flash appeal has been reviewed to reflect the current geographic needs

So far, close to 14,000 children have been reached with child protection activities (including identification, tracing and reunification of separated children with caregivers, rescue of children from child marriages and from exploitative labor, and the provision of psychosocial support).

Heavy rains have intensified in Kenya over the past three weeks, causing death, displacement, flooding and landslides. At least 40,000 people were rendered homeless after the Nzoia river burst its banks on the weekend of 2 May.

Since the beginning of the country’s ‘long rains’ season in early March, more than 233,000 people have been affected, including over 116,000 displaced, according to the Kenya Red Cross Society.

Flooding has been reported in more than three quarters of Kenya’s counties (36 out of 47), with landslides reported in the Rift Valley and the central and coastal regions, according to the Government’s National Disaster Operations Centre.

The Kenya Meteorological Department forecasts aboveaverage rainfall throughout May in parts of the Rift Valley, and in the central, western and coastal regions of Kenya, which could result in further flooding.

The heavy rains have increased the risk of health emergencies and provided conditions conducive to the further breeding of desert locusts in Kenya.

SITUATION OVERVIEW

Heavy rains in Kenya have intensified over the past three weeks, causing death, displacement, flooding and landslides in multiple locations across the country. Landslides have caused destruction and loss of lives in the Rift Valley and the central and coastal regions, according to the National Disaster Operations Centre (NDOC).

The long rains season, which began in March, has to date affected over 233,000 people across 36 of Kenya’s 47 counties, including more than 116,000 people displaced, according to the Kenya Red Cross Society (KRCS). At least 85,000 people are sheltering in displacement camps in the western (more than 55,800 people), North Rift (nearly 15,000), coastal (almost 7,800) and north-eastern (7,000 people) regions. According to the KRCS, at least 54 per cent of the displaced population are female-headed families, while 11 per cent are children under age 5. Kenya’s Interior Cabinet Secretary, Fred Matiang, confirmed during a press conference on 6 May that at least 194 people have been killed by the floods since March. Damage to infrastructure, including schools, houses, roads and bridges has been reported, and over 8,000 acres of farmland, mainly rice nearly mature, have reportedly been destroyed, according to the Government.

In western Kenya, one of the hardest-hit regions, at least 40,000 people were rendered homeless after the Nzoia river burst its banks on the weekend of 2 May. Meanwhile, the rising level of Lake Victoria is impacting families in Kisumu,

Siaya, Busia, Migori and Nyanza counties. According to the Lake Victoria Basin Commission, the water level in the Lake has risen by more than two metres, a situation last seen when the overflow rose by close to 2.5 metres between 1960 and 1964.

In the north-western region, at least 15 people reportedly died and nearly 4,000 were displaced following a mudslide triggered by heavy rains on 18 April in West Pokot and Elgeyo Marakwet counties, according to the KRCS. Multiple homes, a shopping centre and a police post have been damaged. The displaced are sheltered in Sambalat Primary School, where a rescue command centre has been established to coordinate humanitarian assistance. According to humanitarian partners, access to the area remains challenging, as roads have been damaged and heavy rains continue in the area. West Pokot County is prone to landslides and has faced several similar incidents in November 2019.

In Mount Kenya and the Aberdares, heavy rainfall has caused an increase in the volume of the Seven Fork Dam, with flooding reported downstream in areas around Tana River, according to media reports. The Government has urged residents living along Tana River and Garrisa districts to move to higher grounds, as water levels in Kiambere. Kindaruma and Masinga dams are likely to overflow. The Government has also issued a red flood alert to people living in upper Kitui, Murang’a and Elgeyo-Marakwet counties.

The heavy rainfall has increased the risk of disease outbreaks and hampered efforts to contain the COVID-19 pandemic. The Ministry of Health has reported a cholera outbreak in Marsabit county and parts of north-eastern region. People displaced by floods and landslides are living in temporary camps, where more than 70 per cent of people do not have adequate access to clean water. Congestion, poor sanitation, inadequate food and other essentials—such as medicines, mosquito nets, bedding and clothes—are major concerns, according to KRCS. Displaced people are also vulnerable to pneumonia, bilharzia, diarrhoea and cholera, which are prevalent during flooding.

The Kenya Meteorological Department has warned that more heavy rains are expected in the coming days, especially in the Rift Valley, central, western and coastal areas. These conditions are conducive to the further breeding of desert locusts.","The Kenya Meteorological Department forecasts aboveaverage rainfall throughout May in parts of the Rift Valley, and in the central, western and coastal regions of Kenya, which could result in further flooding.

Floods and landslides caused by heavy rain in Kenya have killed nearly 200 people, displaced 100,000 and strained critical infrastructure, officials said on Wednesday.

The heavy rain, which accelerated in mid-April, is expected to continue in already hard-hit areas in the coming weeks, the Kenya Meteorological Department said in its most recent forecast. May usually marks the end of the rainy season.

In Budalangi, western Kenya, residents have had to carry their belongings away from their submerged houses using boats and motorbikes, after the River Nzoia burst its banks.

Government spokesman Cyrus Oguna said on Twitter that over the past three weeks, floods had displaced 100,000 people – complicating efforts to protect against the spread of the coronavirus, which has killed 24 people in the country.

The government is providing food and water to the displaced people and has also requested the Ministry of Health to provide them with masks as a precautionary measure.

Floods and landslides have been concentrated in western Kenya and have so far killed 194 people, Eugene Wamalwa, the minister in charge of relations between the regional leadership and the national government, said.

“Yesterday alone, we have lost 30 people in a matter of 24 hours,” Wamalwa said.

Evacuations

Energy Minister Charles Keter said the water levels at two major Kenyan dams were unprecedentedly high.

The two dams, Masinga and Turkwel, have a combined installed electricity generation capacity of 140MW, representing about 6 percent of Kenya’s total installed capacity.

As Masinga also feeds into several other dams, officials advised people living near those downstream reservoirs to evacuate.

“We are telling people who are downstream, Garissa all the way to Tana River – things are worsening,” Keter said about residents of the two eastern counties.

“We are asking them to move. Let them not wait for water, because this is historical.”

Security officials were already evacuating residents in high-risk areas, Interior Minister Fred Matiang’i added.

“We are not waiting for people to move – we are moving some people away from danger,” he said.

Floods have also destroyed 8,000 acres (3,237.5 hectares) of ricefields, the cabinet secretary for water and irrigation, Sicily Kariuki, said.

Kenya was already facing a looming rice shortage due to shipping disruptions caused by the coronavirus outbreak.

Heavy rains and landslides could also lead to water shortages, Kariuki said.

“The infrastructure to deliver water has been washed away … pipelines have been clogged,” said Kariuki, asking residents of several cities, including the capital Nairobi, to use their water in a “rational” manner.","Government says 100,000 people displaced following torrential rain in the western part of the country.

Thousands of people have been forced to flee flooding in western Kenya after the River Nzoia broke its banks on Saturday following several days of heavy rains, with torrents of water submerging homes and uprooting trees.

Rains have lashed west, central, and southeast Kenya for over a week, causing rivers to overflow, triggering floods and mudslides. Devolution Cabinet Secretary Eugene Wamalwa said on Thursday that 116 people had so far died across 29 of Kenya’s 47 counties.

Media images have shown residents setting up makeshift shelters on narrow stretches of raised ground near the floodwaters. “Shelter is a big priority; people need to be given a place to stay to shield them from the continued rains,” said Asha Mohammed, the secretary general of the Kenya Red Cross. “Roads are cut, bridges have been destroyed, access to health facilities is becoming a challenge.”

The Kenya Red Cross has asked county governments for additional shelters due to concerns that coronavirus could spread due to overcrowding. “I would advocate for an integrated approach to ensure that we are able to reach the same populations talking about COVID-19 prevention, and also ensuring that we deal with the effects of the floods,” said Mohammed.

Abnormally heavy rains have fallen across East Africa. The run-off from the storms that have pelted the Ethiopian highlands has caused flash flooding along the Juba and Shabelle river valleys in neighbouring Somalia. Thousands of people, including those made homeless by conflict and earlier climate shocks, have lost their homes and farms, according to the UN’s emergency aid coordination office, OCHA.

“The river levels are rising at an unprecedented rate,” OCHA’s head of office, Justin Brady, told The New Humanitarian. “We’re seeing water levels now we’d normally see at the end of May.”

Look out for a TNH report soon on the flooding in Somalia.

Agricultural activity is by far the largest consumer of water in Ethiopia. An estimated 93 percent of all water withdrawals in the country (surface water and groundwater) are for agricultural use, much higher than the global average of 70 percent. However, water withdrawn for agriculture represents only an estimated four percent of the overall country’s available renewable water resources. While Ethiopia has relatively abundant water resources, it is considered ‘water stressed’ due to rapid population growth over the last decade. Estimates of renewable annual groundwater per year range from 13.5 to 28 billion m³, of which only about 2.6 billion m³ are currently exploitable. Natural variability in rainfall patterns and distribution, punctuated by extreme climatic events, has thrust many regions of the country into conditions of extreme water scarcity, degraded water quality and chronic food insecurity. At the other extreme, flooding is a significant problem in some parts of Ethiopia. Compounding the unpredictable nature of the country’s rainfall is the shortage of existing water related infrastructure.Ethiopia achieved its Millennium Development Goal target of 57 percent access to safe drinking water, halving the number of people without access to safe water since 1990. Yet access to improved sanitation remains stubbornly low at only 28 percent nationwide up from three percent in 1990. Despite these strides, safe water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) coverage remains insufficient. Inadequate access to safe water and sanitation services and poor hygiene practices negatively impact health and nutrition; diarrheal disease is one of the leading causes of under-five mortality in Ethiopia.

The Government of Ethiopia aims to increase access to safe water supply and basic sanitation in rural and urban areas and to invest more resources into water related infrastructure. For example, under the One WASH National Program, the Government of Ethiopia aims to increase access to safe water supply to 98 percent for rural areas and 100 percent for urban areas and to provide all Ethiopians with access to basic sanitation. We support the Government of Ethiopia’s efforts by incorporating water, sanitation and hygiene activities into its health, education, humanitarian assistance and democracy and governance programs, and water resources management into its agriculture and food security activities.

More than 62 million people are impacted by the Ethiopia water crisis; in fact, 7.5 percent of the global water crisis is in Ethiopia alone.

But, it’s not just about water. Unsafe sanitation and poor hygiene practices, combined with a lack of access to safe water, contribute to the spread of disease. In Ethiopia today, more than 97 million people do not practice proper sanitation. Without safe, enclosed bathrooms, families in very remote villages have no choice but to go outside, which leads to water contamination and a significant impact on the health of the community.

Though daunting, the water crisis does not define Ethiopia. Data shows that out of every country in the world, Ethiopia is projected to be the fastest growing economy in 2019. The country is ever growing and changing, and people are rising to the challenge to create better, healthier lives.

Below are the top facts you should know about the Ethiopia water crisis today and how you can help bring it to an end.

Ethiopia Water Crisis 2019 Facts

1. A Third of the Population is Without Safe Water

The Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP), a global database of water, sanitation, and hygiene data, reports that 31 percent of the Ethiopian population relies on unprotected water for their daily needs. That’s 32 million people.

Another 28 percent of the population has what JMP deems “limited” access, meaning the water is likely safe, but it takes over 30 minutes to retrieve it because of distance, overcrowding, or both.

In total, that is 62 million people living without basic access to safe drinking water.

2019 Progress Update

The country is experiencing a water crisis, and everyone from the national government to small charities, the United Nations, and communities themselves are working to solve it. As a result of concerted efforts, Ethiopia has made substantial progress.

In the year 2000, 75 percent of the population relied on unsafe drinking water. That percentage has been cut in half in just 15 years and continues to fall.

2. Nearly a Quarter of the Population is Without a Toilet

The JMP reports that 22 percent of people in Ethiopia are practicing what’s called “open defecation” (OD), the act of using the bathroom in fields, forests, or along the countryside.

In these communities, human feces are washed by the rain into rivers, springs, ponds, and swamps—places where a third of the population is gathering their drinking water. This creates an unsafe environment, especially for children.

Families that drink this contaminated water experience waterborne diseases and pay expensive fees for treatment at local clinics and hospitals.

2019 Progress Update

In the year 2000, nearly 80 percent of Ethiopians were using the restroom outside and in the open. In 2017, that number dropped to 22.35 percent.

To accomplish this, many communities developed structures called “pit latrines.” These bathrooms, by definition, have four walls, a roof, and a door to keep flies out. These structures help keep disease from spreading.

3. Almost Half of the Population Has No Handwashing Facility

JMP regards “basic” hygiene access as the “availability of a handwashing facility on premises with soap and water.”

In Ethiopia, 41 percent of households have no handwashing facility at all. Most people, 51 percent, have a handwashing facility but no reliable source of water or soap. The remaining 8 percent have “basic” access, meaning they have access to a facility with soap and water.

This makes maintaining healthy hygiene and sanitation extremely difficult for most communities in Ethiopia.

2019 Progress Update

Data shows that the hygiene problem in Ethiopia has largely remained the same from 2012-2017, when the data was last collected. However, in Ethiopian communities where Lifewater works, over 78,000 people (since 2016) have built simple, home-made structures called “tippy-taps” at their homes.

Each day, more Ethiopians are getting access to hand washing and improved health.

Help End the Ethiopia Water Crisis

Lifewater’s Vision of a Healthy Village model for addressing the water crisis is facilitating significant progress for safe water, improved sanitation, and hand washing in every country where Lifewater works. Through house-by-house visits, Lifewater staff come to know the families in villages in need across the globe. They work together to adopt critical health practices and ultimately, build a safe water source in their community that lasts for generations.

In West Arsi, Ethiopia, recent advancements promise health and hope for the entire region.

Still, Ethiopia has a high mortality rate caused in part by the WASH problem in the country. One in every 17 children do not live to see their fifth birthday, and diarrheal disease is the leading cause of death in Ethiopia.

This is entirely preventable, and exactly what Lifewater’s model has proven to help resolve in remote, hard-to-reach villages. Results from an in-depth survey of Lifewater’s first complete program cycle in West Arsi, Ethiopia, show that diarrheal disease was nearly eliminated. Lives were saved. Children were healthy, and families rejoiced.

Measurement of PH is one of the most important and frequently used tests in water chemistry. Although, the Ethiopian Drinking water standard has set an allowable PH value ranges from 6.5 to 8.5 (ES 2001), it is known that PH is more important as operational water quality parameters than its impact on consumers. The median value of PH for the spring, tap, and well water samples collected from each region and administrative city of the country (Fig. 2), are among the Ethiopian standard for drinking water as indicated in Tables 1, 2, and 3, and an aggregated median PH value for spring, tap and well water are 6.93, 7.31, and 7.52 respectively as shown in Table 4. 63 % of samples collected from spring, 85 % from Tap, and 89 % from well water has a pH values in the middle of 6.5 and 8.5. Thus, the median PH value of water sample source are between the ranges and has not palatability or aesthetic problem. On the other hand, very low PH values were observed. For example, a spring water source from Oromia (Ambo Sekele-5) has a PH of 4.76 where as a tap water source from Addis Ababa showed a PH of 4.9. In contrast, very high PH values were also obtained in tap and well water sources. A tap water source from Tigray (Tsaeda Emba) and Addis Ababa (Nifas Silk Lafto sub city) has a PH of 9.7 and 11.80 respectively. Similarly, a PH of 10.35 was noted for a sample from a well water source from Amhara (Quarite). Likewise, a PH of 9.0, 9.1, and 9.5 for a well water source from Afar (Hamiltole School), Oromia (Meki Cattle Market) and Addis Ababa (Yeka) respectively were recorded.

Silica in water is undesirable for a number of industrial uses because it forms difficult to remove silica and silicate scales in equipment, particularly on high pressure blades (APHA 1992). The median result of total silica is 41.36 mg/L for spring, 24.08 mg/L for tap, and 62.86 mg/L for well water samples observed nationally from the collected sample sources (Table 4). Yet, the Ethiopian drinking water Standard does not state the health effect of Silica and there are no recommended limit values (ES 2001).

Sodium is present in most natural waters. A recommended limit value for Sodium in drinking water set by the Ethiopian standard is 200 mg/L (ES 2001). The number of samples from well water with high sodium concentration is higher than the tap and spring water samples. As well, very high Sodium concentration was recorded in spring water sources, 1020 mg/L from Somali (Afder, Bari) and 5304 mg/L from Oromia (North Shoa Ejere). In tap water sources, 1088 mg/L from Oromia (Ethiopia Cutting Mojo-1) and 1190 mg/L from Oromia (Koka Dam outlet) were noted extremely high in Sodium concentration. In addition, well water sources, 1842.8 mg/L from Afar (Handeg village), 4986.67 mg/L from Afar (Hamiltole School) and 6006.7 mg/L from Afar (Dubty, magenta) were very high sodium concentration recorded. The ratio of sodium to total cations is important in agriculture and human pathology. But, persons afflicted with certain diseases require water with low sodium concentration. Though, the state of Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) has set the drinking water standard for sodium at 160 mg/L to protect individuals that are susceptible to sodium sensitive hypertension or diseases that cause difficulty in regulating body fluid volume (FDEP 2014). Although, no health based guideline value is proposed for sodium in drinking water, the concentrations in excess of 200 mg/L may give rise to unacceptable taste (WHO 2011; ES 2001). While, recent finding reports that reducing salt intake lowers blood pressure and also reduces the incidence of cardiovascular diseases (WHO 2012). Similarly, for all those water sources extremely high in sodium concentration may rise cardiovascular diseases and this will increase the mortality rate.

This result indicated that relative maximum total hardness value was recorded in spring water samples from Oromia (1100 mg/L); tap water from Addis Ababa (1600 mg/L), and well water samples from the Afar region (12,800 mg/L). Forty-two of spring water, twenty-five of tap water and eighty-seven of the well water samples were exceeded the national recommended limit for total hardness (ES 2001). Hard water can affect acceptability of drinking water above a certain limit. However, Public acceptability of the degree of hardness of water may vary considerably from one community to another, depending on local conditions (WHO 1993). The need for softening of domestic supplies depends on reasons of convenience and economy rather than of health concern, since even at very high concentrations of up to 1000 mg/L hardness is quite harmless. Similarly, there is some evidence that Total Hardness can have a protective effect against heart disease or an inverse relation with cardiovascular diseases in general. Indeed, there is some statistical evidence to suggest that artificially softened water may increase the incidence of some forms of heart disease (Tebbutt 1998).

However, 167 and 54 water samples were in compliance with national standards for calcium and magnesium respectively for all water sources. Ethiopian Standard sets its maximum limit of 50 mg/L of magnesium in drinking water. Magnesium is a common constituent of natural water and it is an important contributor to the hardness of water, magnesium salts break down when heated, and forming scale in boilers. Coand economy rather than of health concern, since evenncentration greater than 125 mg/L also can have a cathartic and diuretic effect (APHA 1992). The long term magnesium exposure in mineral water consumption can contribute to a sufficiently high urine volume and consequently to a decline in the concentration of lithogeny substances and the risk of calcium oxalate crystallization, counterbalancing increased calcium excretion (Siener et al. 2004). In general, aggregated median concentration of calcium, magnesium, and total hardness in all water samples conformed to the national standard.

Chloride, in the form of chloride (Cl−) ion, is one of the major inorganic anions in water and wastewater. It can originate from natural and anthropogenic activities, such as sewage and industrial effluents. Ethiopian Standard sets the Chloride limit of 250 mg/L Chloride for drinking water (ES 2001). Although, a total of 39 samples has exceeded the standard limit of 250 mg/L, a higher number of well water samples have contributed to this divergence. The regional distribution as shown in Table 1, 2, and 3 puts Afar region at the top having 21 samples in compliance to the national standard. Relatively, chloride concentration was detected higher in well water samples than spring and tap water samples. The very high Chloride value of spring water sources, 1399.6 mg/L from Somali (Afder, Bare) and 5598 mg/L from Oromia (North Shoa Ejere) were recorded. Additionally, in the well water sources extremely high chloride concentration of 3338.96 mg/L from Somali (Gilfega village), 12,995.97 mg/L from Afar (Dubty, magenta), and 13,195.91 mg/L from Afar (Hamiltole School), were recorded. The high chloride content may harm metallic pipes and structures (Terrence et al. 2007) and chloride concentrations in excess of about 250 mg/L can give rise to detectable taste in drinking water. On the other hand, no health based guideline value is proposed for chloride in drinking water.

Water may contain \( {\text{PO}}_{4}^{3 - } \) derived from contact with natural minerals or through pollution from an application of fertilizer, sewage and industrial waste. Hence, ground water is more likely to have higher \( {\text{PO}}_{4}^{3 - } \) concentration (Maiti 2004). The median concentration of Phosphate nationally for spring, tap, and well water samples were 0.05, 0.04, and 0.06 mg/L, respectively as indicated in Table 4. However, the extremely high phosphate value was recorded in well water sources than spring and tap water sources. And yet, the WHO guideline and Ethiopian Standard could not state its health effect and also does not consider its guideline standard value for drinking water quality.","Yet, the Ethiopian drinking water Standard does not state the health effect of Silica and there are no recommended limit values (ES 2001).

In Ethiopia, access to improved water supply and sanitation has been very low and hence majority of the communicable diseases are associated with unsafe and inadequate water supply. Thus, the aim of this study was to assess physicochemical and bacteriological characteristics of water from sources to household connection in Nekemte town. A cross-sectional study was conducted from November 2015 to March 2016. Water samples were collected in triplicates from selected 30 sampling points from source, disinfection point, main distribution system tank, and household taps. All samples were analysed for bacteriological, chemical, and physical quality parameters using standard procedures. The results showed that temperature, pH, turbidity, total dissolved substances, and electrical conductivity of the water samples were varied between 16.9 and 22°C, 6.8–7.0, nil-12 NTU, 50–70 mg/l, and 40–46 µS/cm, respectively. Phosphate and nitrate concentrations of the water samples also ranged between 0.65 and 1 mg/l and 2.2–6.5 mg/l, respectively. Free residual chlorine concentration in the majority of the water samples was less than 0.5 mg/l. All samples were positive for total coliform with counts ranging from 12 to 120 CFU/100 ml, whereas faecal coliforms were detected in only 37% of tap water samples. In general, the majority of the tested parameters were within the permissible range of both the WHO and Ethiopian drinking water standards. However, Fe, Mn, faecal coliforms, total coliforms, and temperature did not conform to both WHO and Ethiopian drinking water standards. Based on the results, we can conclude that water quality deterioration was both at the sources and in the supply networks. Hence, proper drainage, sewage disposal systems, and sufficient disinfection of water with chlorine are of prime importance to deliver safe drinking water to the residents of Nekemte town.

1. Introduction

The majority of population in developing countries has no access to clean water and any form of sanitation services. Consequently, millions of people are suffering from diseases related to water, sanitation, and hygiene, such as diarrhoea, skin diseases, and trachoma [1]. Unsafe water, inadequate sanitation, and poor hygiene are linked to 88% of diarrhoea cases worldwide [2]. Waterborne diseases are caused by the ingestion of water contaminated with human or animal faeces or urine containing pathogenic bacteria or viruses including cholera, typhoid, bacillary dysentery, adenoviruses, retroviruses, and other diseases. In addition, water derived from various sources may also contain dissolved inorganic and organic substances which could cause health problems to the community.

Poor water quality is considered as one of the manifestations of poverty in developing countries. Accordingly, improvement in drinking water supply, quality, and sanitation and reducing waterborne diseases have been major components of the sustainable development goal (SDG) programmes in goal 6 formulated by UN [3]. However, the effort of delivering safe water to the population has encountered several challenges. These are population growth, poor sanitation, and contamination of water sources with domestic wastes and industrial effluents [4, 5]. This shows that despite the worldwide efforts of delivering safe drinking water, the transmission of waterborne diseases is still a matter of major concern.

Ethiopia is confronted with poor sanitation and drinking water infrastructure [5]. About 52.1% of the population has been using unimproved sanitation facilities while 36% of them practiced open defecation [6]. It is estimated that more than 60% of the communicable diseases are due to poor environmental health conditions arising from unsafe and inadequate water supply with poor hygienic and sanitation practices [7]. Likewise, most health problems of children in the country are communicable diseases due to polluted water and improper sanitation.

The problems of contamination of urban water distribution system are diverse. The major sources of water contaminants are mostly wastes from improper sanitation and agricultural and other activities that make their way to the water distribution networks [8]. Furthermore, break in the distribution system, age and improper maintenance of the distribution system, and low level of chlorine usually compromise the integrity of the distribution system and quality of potable water.

Therefore, this requires proper protection of water supply from contamination and regular surveillance of water sources to reduce water-related diseases. Continuous examination of water quality analysis based on detection of indicator organisms is among the methods of assessing the hygienic condition of water [9]. Physicochemical parameters such as turbidity, pH, temperature, nitrate, and others are widely accepted as other critical water quality parameters for drinking water. These parameters either directly influence microbiological quality or affect disinfection efficiencies and human health.

Several studies carried out in Ethiopia on the physicochemical and bacteriological quality of drinking water from various sources showed that water sources were contaminated with pollution indicators such as faecal and total coliforms [4, 8–15]. These indicate that water-quality problems are rampant in water-delivery systems of the country. This necessitates establishment of sustainable monitoring and evaluation system of municipal water distribution systems. This study was, therefore, initiated to assess the status of drinking water quality from sources to households in Nekemte town.

2. Materials and Methods

2.1. Study Area

Nekemte is a market town and separate woreda in Western Ethiopia. It is located in the East Welega Zone of the Oromia Region. Nekemte has a latitude and longitude of 9°5′N 36°33′E/9.083°N 36.550°E and an elevation of 2,088 meters above sea level. The population of the town is estimated to be 110,688. The average temperature of the town is 17.6°C, and the average annual rainfall is 1988 mm. There are agricultural farms in and around the city which are irrigated with river water. These rivers receive numerous discharges of raw sewage, community refuse, and urban wastewater. Drinking water of the town comes from large reservoirs located in Diga Woreda, which is about 12 km away from the center of the town (Figure 1).

A cross-sectional study was conducted to assess the bacteriological and physicochemical quality of drinking water from source (untreated, before undergoing any treatment), disinfection point (treated, when it leaves the disinfection unit), main distribution system tank, and private tap of the town from September 2015 to March 2016. The samples were collected three times from each sampling site within 15 days interval.

A total of 30 triplicate water samples were collected from sampling points according to the WHO guidelines [16]. Of these, 27 were private taps distributed in 9 Kebeles (the smallest administrative unit of the town). Three different streets were selected purposely from each Kebele to include both the old and new areas. Then, three sites were selected by a simple random sampling method, and one household with tap water was selected randomly from each site. Written informed consent was obtained from each household to collect water sample and noted for second and third round sampling. Samples (250 ml) were collected in sterilized glass bottles rinsed thoroughly with nitric acid and sterilized distilled water. For the chlorinated water samples, about 2.5 ml sodium thiosulphate was added into each sampling bottle to stop the chlorination process during transportation [11]. Water samples were transported to Nekemte Water Supply and Sewerage Service Enterprise Laboratory and Oromia Regional Health Laboratory, Nekemte Laboratory, in a cold box containing ice freezer packs for physicochemical analysis and bacteriological count, respectively.

2.3. Sample Analysis

2.3.1. Total and Faecal Coliforms Count

Total and faecal coliform counts were carried out by membrane filtration technique [15]. A sterilized pad dispenser was used to introduce the growth absorbent pads into the base of Petri dishes, and the growth pads were saturated with the Lauryl Sulphate Broth. 100 ml water sample was filtered using a membrane filter (0.45 µm) in a vacuum filtration apparatus, and all the filters were transferred to the absorbent pad which was saturated with the broth. The Petri dishes were incubated at 37°C for 4 hr for resuscitation to recover physiologically stressed coliforms before incubation. Then after, plates for total coliform and thermotolerant coliform counts were incubated at 37°C and 44°C, respectively, for 24 hrs, and then colonies were counted and recorded [15].

2.3.2. Analysis of Physicochemical Parameters

The physicochemical parameters were analysed by standard procedures. Physical parameters such as pH, temperature, and EC were measured using a portable digital pH meter, a thermometer, and an EC meter, respectively, at sites of sample collection. Turbidity of the samples was determined using a turbidity meter in the laboratory. The remaining water-quality parameters including nitrate, iron, manganese, phosphate, sulphate, and free residual chlorine, physical parameters, and TDS were determined following standard methods [15] using a DR 2400 spectrophotometer (Loveland, USA).

2.4. Data Analysis

The data were recorded, organized, and summarized in a Microsoft excel sheet. Data analysis was carried out by SPSS version 23. Descriptive statistics, one-way ANOVA (Duncan’s multiple range test (DMRT)), and linear regression were employed to analyse the data at significance level and 95% confidence interval.

3. Results and Discussion

3.1. Bacteriological and Physicochemical Characteristics of Water from Untreated Source, Reservoir, and Disinfection Point

The physiochemical characteristics of water samples collected from sources, disinfection, and distribution points are shown in Table 1. The results showed that average temperature records of the water samples range from 20.5 to 20.8 C without showing significant difference among the sources (Table 1). Similarly, earlier studies in Gondar zone [12] and Bahir Dar [17] reported a mean temperature of 21.3 C and 23.8 C, respectively. In tropics, the climate is characterized by high temperature and rainfall, and these factors might have contributed to the high temperature records of water samples from different cities of Ethiopia that did not meet the WHO standard of <15 C [18].

The pH of water samples was within the narrow range of 6.8–7.03 and did not vary significantly among sampling points. It remained within the recommended standard limits of 6.5–8.5 [18, 19]. The pH values of water obtained in this study are lower than the results of previous studies, i.e., the average basic pH records of various cities water sources, pH 7.6 at Akaki Kality, subcity of Addis Ababa [10]; pH 8.3 at Ziway [20]; and pH of 7.8 at Adama [14]. The variation could be due to geological conditions of the water sources.

The turbidity of water samples was within the range of 0–12 NTU with the highest record in untreated water from sources (Table 1). The average turbidity values of water sources were found to be significantly higher ( ) than that of treated water sources. Turbidity value of source water did not comply with both WHO and NGL standards [18, 19]. The TDS records of water samples in the present study were found to be below the recommended standard limits of both [18, 19].

Electrical conductivity in natural waters is the normalized measure of the water’s ability to conduct electric current. This is mostly influenced by dissolved salts such as sodium chloride and potassium chloride. The highest EC (70 μs/cm) was recorded from untreated water sources, while the lowest electrical conductivity was recorded from water samples obtained from disinfection (46 μs/cm) and reservoir (45 μs/cm) points. The EC records of water source from other cities of the country are much higher than the current study [11, 21]. These variations might originate from geological factors, agricultural activity, and the soil types of the study area.

Nitrate concentrations of the water samples from sources, disinfection point, and main distribution tank were 1.8 mg/1, 1.3 mg/1,and 1.3 mg/1, respectively. The phosphate concentrations were 1 mg/1, 0.6 mg, and 0.56 mg/1, respectively. The two ions concentrations in untreated water sources were significantly higher than the rest points. However, there were no variations between disinfection point and main distribution tank water sources both in nitrate and phosphate concentrations. Nevertheless, the nitrate records of the water sources were much less than the recommended limits of <50 mg/l in drinking water [16, 19]. This indicates that the nitrate and phosphate concentrations are not the problem of water in the study area. The nitrate content of water source samples measured in this study is less than the maximum values of 10.8 mg/l and 12.9 mg/l from source waters of Ziway town [20] and Bahr Dar town [17], respectively.

The free residual chlorine (FRC) content of water samples from disinfection point and main distribution tank were 0.23 mg/l and 0.28 mg/l, respectively. These values were less than the maximum concentration set by WHO. These values are slightly lower than the results reported at the treatment outlet of Ziway (0.79 mg/l) town [20] and recorded at Akaki Kality, subcity of Addis Ababa (0.67 mg/l) [10]. However, the FRC values were by far better than 0.03 mg/l recorded from the main distribution tank of Bahir Dar town [17].

The samples were also analysed for bacteriological quality, and our results showed that all water sources contained higher load of TC (Table 1). Likewise, FC was detected in water sources at all stages. In all cases, both TC and FC counts were above the recommended levels set by WHO standards [18]. However, significant reduction was observed for FC, which might be attributed to the treatment process. The degree of bacterial contamination of untreated source water in this study was found to be higher than that in the earlier studies [17, 22]. The difference between the current study and earlier works elsewhere in Ethiopia might be due to the variations of study season and socioeconomic characteristics of the communities residing in the study areas. In addition, the water sources of the current research area were surrounded by open defecation areas and many farming fields.

3.2. Bacteriological and Physicochemical Quality Analyses of Household Water Sources

3.2.1. Bacteriological Quality of Household Tap Water

The highest TC count was recorded from tap water at sampling site 3 of Kebele 08, with 95 CFU/100 ml, followed by 78 CFU/100 ml at sampling site 1 of Kebele 08 (Table 2). The lowest TC count was found at sampling sites from 05 with 14 to 16 CFU/100 ml. Total coliform counts of the tap water were lower than water samples from the main distribution tank after treatment indicating that the treatment system significantly reduced microbial load of the water. On the contrary, more than 63% of the tap water samples did not show any FC count. The highest FC count of 22.5CFU/100 ml was recorded from sampling site 3 of Kebele 06, whereas no faecal coliform was detected from all sampling sites of Kebele 07 and 09 (Table 2).

Generally, faecal coliforms counts in household taps were lower than that recorded for the main distribution tank, except two sites from Kebele 08 and Kebele 05. The reduction of the TC and FC counts in household tap water samples could be attributed to free residual chlorine applied at the disinfection point of the treatment system. In general, 100% of the tap water samples did not meet the TC standard (1–10 CFU/100 ml) set by WHO, whereas about 37% of the samples failed to meet “safe water quality” with regard to FC criteria of 0 CFU/100/ml [16]. Similarly, a previous study had detected both TC and FC in all tap water samples of Bahir Dar city of Ethiopia [8].

3.2.2. Physicochemical Quality of Household Tap Water

In this study, selected physical and chemical characteristics of household tap water which have public health implications were analysed to assess its status. The results of this study showed that the nitrate concentration was in the range of 2.2–6 mg/l with the lowest record from Kebele 02, site 01 and Kebele 04 site 03, and the highest record was from Kebele 01, site 02 (Table 2). This might be due to the over leaching of nitrate-containing organic wastes and from the use of fertilizers in the nearby agricultural fields. Our results are comparable to the average values of 0.3–7.0 mg/l from Ziway town [20], and less than nitrate content reported from Bahr Dar (9–30.1 mg/l) [17].

The phosphate concentration of the tap water samples was within 0.35–1 mg/l (Table 2). Majority (90%) of the water samples from household tap had higher phosphate concentration than disinfection point and main distribution tank water samples (0.6–0.56 mg/l) (Table 1), indicating that there is contamination of this ion in the supply network. The sulphate concentration of the tap water samples was within 11–26 mg/l, which was higher than the levels recorded from source, disinfection point, and main distribution tank water samples (4–14.5 mg/l) (Table 1).

All water samples from households contained less than 0.5 mg/l FRC except all sites from Kebele 03. Furthermore, two site samples did not contain FRC. All taken together, more than 15.2% of the water samples was found to be inferior to the proper water treatment standard using chlorine set by WHO [18] and ESA [19]. In general, this indicates that there is limitation in the water chlorination system in the town. Similar studies showed that 37.5% and 95.7% of tap water samples from tap water distribution systems in Ziway [20] and Bahr Dar towns [17] contained lower FRC than the recommended limits.

Our results showed that the temperature of the tap water samples ranged between 16.8°C and 22.1°C without showing any significant difference among the sites (Table 3) and hence did not meet the WHO standard of <15°C [18]. Likewise, similar earlier studies [8, 12] reported higher temperature values in drinking water from different Ethiopian cities. The pH of tap water samples varied from 6.6 to 7.0 (Table 3) without any significance among the sampling points. In general, the pH values of drinking water samples from source to private tap were in the recommended range of 6.5–7.8 (WHO 2006; ESA 2013). Similarly, previous studies showed that the pH values of drinking water in various cities of the country were within the recommended range [10, 14, 20, 23].

The turbidity of the tap water samples was in the range of 0.1–1.7 NTU without significant differences among the sampling sites. The turbidity of all tap water samples was significantly lower than that of the source water (Tables 1 and 3), and all of them were below 5NTU, a maximum acceptable value of WHO [16] and ESA [18]. Compared to the results of other similar studies from different towns of the country, turbidity records of tap water in Nekemte is very low [8, 10, 14, 20].

The TDS (37–46.5 mg/l) measurements of the tap water samples did not show significant ( ) differences from the water sources and water main distribution tanks showing that there is no external factor that could contribute to the increase or decrease of these parameters in the tap water distribution system. The TDS values of tap water samples fell below the maximum acceptable standard of 600 mg/l [16]. Similarly, Yasin et al. [11] had obtained lower TDS (524.7) in Serbo town tap water. In contrast, high TDS values were recorded from tap water of Debre Zeit town [23]. The electrical conductivity (EC) measurements of water samples were found to be in the range of 58–70 μS/cm. These results were much lower than those of the research conducted in Debre Ziet [23] and Serbo towns [11].

4. Conclusions

In this study, the physicochemical and bacteriological quality of water samples from untreated source, main distribution system (main distribution tank), and tap water supply systems of Nekemte town were analysed, and majority of them were within the permissible range of both WHO and Ethiopian drinking water standards. However, Fe, Mn, FC, TC, and temperature did not meet the standards. About 85% of tap water samples analysed showed FRC values less than the standard set by WHO. This indicates that there was insufficient chlorination in the treatment system. All water samples from both the sources and household taps were contaminated by TC and FC. On the contrary, the majority of water samples from household taps were not contaminated with FC. This implies that water contamination is both at the source and in the supply network. Moreover, the presence of water-quality indicator bacteria might be associated with poor waste disposal systems and management of water sources. Therefore, there is a need to design an efficient waste disposal system and a catchment area management system around the water sources. In addition, regular drinking water-quality assessment of the source, main distribution tanks, distribution systems, and pipes should also be employed to ensure that the water is safe for human use. The present study was limited to assessing bacteriological and physical-chemical parameters from source to household tap connections of the water supply system in dry season. Thus, a similar study should be conducted during the wet season of the year. In addition, further study should consider additional water-quality parameters such as heavy metals and their source.

knowhow. The statistical report also supp orts this. Of t he

total respondent s 85.4% confirmed as the project idea

emanated fro m the commu nity ; 82.4% reported as the site

selection was done predominantly by the woreda water

office and 83.9% also asserted as they were not in volved in

To have a full picture about communities’ contr ibution,

data was collected on the type of support they provided.

Accordingly, it was found that, of 181 respondents who

participated in the project develop ment 44.8% contributed

their labor, money and local materials; 2 8.2% contributed

labor and money; 7.7% contributed labor and lo cal material ;

7.2% contributed la bor, money and loc al material; 5.5%

contribution either in money or materia l .

In addition to participation dur ing the project construction,

communities’ res ponsibility and pa rticipation in managi ng

the water sup ply systems d uring oper ation is also t he key for

the sustainability of the schemes . Field observations had

given a chance to observe communitie s’ participation in the

management and use of the water schemes. The presence of

fences and guards in most of water point s is a positive

participatory response from the beneficiaries reflecting their

desire to sustain the water schemes. The finding of the

household s urvey and in terviews wit h the wate r projec t

coordinators of th e s ample Kebeles also reflected the high

degree of responsibi lity the majorities (197) assume and

have in protecting and maintai ning the long - term

performance of the water schemes. Hence, they are

performing different activities including paying service fee

on time; labor an d money contribution during operation an d

maintenance; protecting the schemes from damage and

contaminatio n by fencin g and plantin g trees.

In general, in the sample kebele s of Gonji Kolela woreda

the existing participation a nd contribution of the communit y

was found to be prom ising for futu re planning and

implementation of additional schemes in the area to enhance

adequacy of water supply and better satisfy the community’s

water need.

4. Conclusion and Recomme ndations

Conclusion

The social and economic importance of provision of

potable water supply is widely recognized. Wat er supply

projects have impacts on people's lives, which extend far

beyond the expected im provements to health and re duction

in time spent to collect water.

In Ethiopia rural water coverage has increased at

promising rates since 1990, from 8 percent to 26 perc ent

according to JMP figures, and from 11 percent to 62 percent

according to gov ernment figures. Des pite such

improvements, rural water supply coverage across such a

large population and geographic area is f ound to be a

challenge; and so it is timely to assess the conditions in

different pa rts of the countr y. Thus, this r esearch is an

attempt in this direction.

Fr om the findi ngs of the stud y, it can be co ncluded that the

water supply in the study area, Gonji Kolela Woreda, is far

less adequate due to multiple reasons. The stud y elicited the

main reasons why water supply systems have become

inadequate in the area. The woreda technicians or experts are

few in number and thus are not able to provide tech nical

support in all sites of the woreda’s water supply schemes.

Moreover, the institutional, technica l, material and financial

support to the woreda water bureau was f ound to be very

weak, which highly deter the capacity of the bureau. This

weak institutional capacity was due to shortage of skilled

manpower, lack of logistics and lack of sufficient budget for

monitoring a nd follows up a nd operatio n and maintena nce.

Buil ding financial capacity for a well - organized and

equipped woreda of fice requires part nership among th e

regional state, the local community as owners of the schemes,

and NGOs as supporter . Although the re is a fair ly good l evel

of functional ity in the wor eda , in some of the water schemes

partial and complete non - functionality were observed and

this highly limited effective coverage in the area. If

meaningful sustainability in water schemes is to be achieved,

renewing or r eplacing t he syste m when it gets o ld o r unable

to function, is par amount .

In the study areas, involvement of local communities to

decisions related to development of rural water supply is

great. From the study it has been found that the par ticipation

of local people during project initiation a nd development

phases was significant. The willingness of the societ y to

participate in and contribute to the development and

management of wat er supply projects w as found to be

promising for further proj ect planning and implementat ion in

the area.

Recomme ndation

For the succe ss in the achie vement of s ustainable r ural

water supply coverage in Gonji Kolela woreda, it is

recommended to give attention to the foll owing major

actions:

To achieve me aningful su stainabilit y with the ri ght

support framework and stre ngthen the manager ial and

technical capacity at woreda level, attention should be given

to capacity building in terms of manpo wer, logistics and

budget. Thus, appropriate, and sustainable financing

strategies are required from regional and zonal bu reaus no t

only for day - to - day management practices, but also for cost

recovery to replicate the system.

In order to keep water supply system sustainable,

there should b e preventive a nd regular maintenance

program by local institutions. It is, therefor e,","The presence offences and guards in most of water point s is a positiveparticipatory response from the beneficiaries reflecting theirdesire to sustain the water schemes.

For a decade, it grew at more than 10% a year and this has contributed to significant development progress. Increasing access to safely managed water and sanitation can help sustain this progress and accelerate poverty reduction.

But economic growth in Ethiopia is a thirsty business and diminishing water supplies can translate into slowdowns and cloud economic prospects. Water touches every aspect of development. It is essential for food production, for example, and water and sanitation are critical to improving human capital outcomes such as reducing child mortality, tackling communicable diseases and increasing life expectancy.

That’s why Ethiopia is one of the Global Water Security & Sanitation Partnership (GWSP)’s priority countries, with specific and strategic investments. Simply put, Ethiopia is where some of the most impactful GWSP-supported innovative interventions and approaches are tested, refined and scaled-up.

Ethiopia successfully met its Millennium Development Goal (MDG) for drinking water supply ahead of 2015 but fell some way short of achieving its MDG target for sanitation. A key challenge in reaching Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6 is that few people have either safe in-house water access and or latrines with safely managed fecal waste.

‘Safely-managed water’, as defined by the SDGs, must be on premises, available when needed, and free from contamination. At present, only 63 percent and 4 percent are on premises in urban and rural areas respectively.

So GWSP is helping rural communities with the knowledge and knowhow they need to help maintain water facilities and expand access to water services. The World Bank’s Water GP is helping to establish supply chains for spare parts, procuring equipment and tools, and building local private operators’ capacity. In addition, a pilot is currently

underway to look at the viability of rural utilities working across village clusters to achieve economies of scale.

Open defecation is still practiced by 32 percent of Ethiopia’s rural population and 7 percent of urban households. Handwashing facilities are limited and fecal sludge management is also limited, particularly in rural areas. To reach the SDG 6 goal of 'sustainable and safely managed sanitation” it will be critical to develop city-wide holistic sanitation services in urban areas and off-site sanitation infrastructure in rural areas.

This is where the experiences fostered by GWSP can step in and provide support. The Partnership builds on decades of knowledge, learning and practical experience from the World Bank, the Water Partnership Program (WPP) and the Water and Sanitation Program (WSP). And WSP’s technical assistance was instrumental in helping the government of Ethiopia develop an integrated urban sanitation and hygiene strategy. This groundwork contributed to design improvements in a $445 million World Bank loan to improve existing onsite and sewer-based solutions, increase FSM services and expand decentralized wastewater treatment plants.

GWSP is now helping several cities implement the national strategy through the Citywide Inclusive Sanitation approach (CWIS) to ensure that fecal sludge is safely captured, transported and treated in urban areas. Over 20 utilities across the country were trained in the use of CWIS tools, materials and approaches for the design of urban sanitation interventions. The national and international advisors who support the government in implementing the project also received guidance on CWIS approaches and principles.

The GWSP’s five themes of institutions, inclusion, sustainability, resilience and finance inform all of its water and sanitation interventions in Ethiopia. To increase the capacity of institutions, GWSP support is helping establish training curricula in local colleges aimed at improving the operations and maintenance (O&M) and construction skills of local private operators, technicians, and artisans. Technical assistance is also being provided to help develop skills in sanitation marketing and behavior change.

The cost of constructing safely managed latrines is often prohibitive for women, the poor and other disadvantaged groups, putting inclusion at risk. To overcome this challenge, GWSP will help shape a $205 million Water, Sanitation and Hygiene Project so everyone, especially women, can have a seat at the table and a voice in the conversation. Mechanisms to improve transparency will be developed to ensure women’s participation in rural areas and small towns across nine regions.

Through its work on water, sanitation, institutions and inclusion, GWSP is helping strengthen even further the robust foundations of economic growth and human capital in Ethiopia.","Increasing access to safely managed water and sanitation can help sustain this progress and accelerate poverty reduction.

SITUATION OVERVIEW Ethiopia is experiencing extreme weather variability with some areas experiencing drought, while others are impacted by flooding. Based on the NMA weather forecast for the belg/gu season (January to April/May), the Government-led Flood Task Force released a Flood Alert listing the areas at risk of flooding during the current rainy season.

According to NMA weather outlook, belg/gu rain will increase its temporal and spatial coverage even beyond the usual belg/gu dependent areas of the country. In May, the rains are anticipated to increase across most parts of the country. Moreover, heavy fall is likely to occur in some places of eastern, southern, southeastern, and southwestern parts of the country.

In the past few weeks, flood incidences were reported from some areas of the country. On 24 April, flash floods killed four persons and damaged 53 houses (fully) and 212 houses (partially) in Dire Dawa; on 25 April, river overflow damaged social infrastructure and affected livestock in Jinka town, SNNP; and on 25/26 April, flash floods affected 34,507 households and displaced 15,195 households in Erer, Sitti, Nogob and Korahe zones, Somali region.

Local communities in the Dawa zone that spoke to humanitarian partners, stated that they have never experienced such amount of water in the Dawa River. On May 4, the flood caused a total collapse of the main bridges between Hudet to Negalle and Mubarak to Filtu. In addition to this, the rains made travel to rural areas within the Dawa zone difficult.

In SNNP, the rain-induced landslide in four woredas of Gamo zone (Chencha, Gerese, Gacho Baba, and Kemba) from 11 to 18 April resulted in eight fatalities, displacement of 1,383 people, destruction of 34 houses and the damage of 234 hectares of land. Similarly, some 1,665 people were affected by landslide and heavy rain in Bonke woreda (Gamo zone). The zonal Red Cross Society provided NFIs (clothes and household utensils) and the zonal DRMO delivered flour (14 quintals) to the displaced and affected community.

Similar reports of storms / heavy rainfall were received from the zones of Hadya (Lemo and Shashego woredas), Halaba (Wera), Silite (Sankura), and Basketo Special woreda.

So far, close to 219,000 and 107,000 people are affected and displaced respectively due to floods in Somali, Afar, SNNP, Dire Dawa and Harari. Over 90% of the flood-affected and displaced people are from the Somali region. The flood task force is reactivated, and response activities are ongoing in the Somali region.

By large, the belg/gu rain will be expected to have a positive impact on water recharging and agriculture/pasture development activities. However, it is always advisable to take all the necessary precautions, prevention, and mitigation measures to minimize the negative impact of flood disasters on peoples' lives and livelihoods. Nevertheless, there may be a need for partners to support affected and displaced communities together with the Government.

The Government-led multi-agency needs assessment started early May in the Somali region. The assessment will gauge the impact of the floods on people's lives and livelihood and also, will identify food and non-food needs. The findings will be expected to trigger humanitarian responses using EHF and other funding mechanisms.

HUMANITARIAN RESPONSE

In the Somali region, IOM distributed 500 standard NFI Kits to 500 displaced households in Borda-Korah kebele of Ber'ano woreda. IRC pledged to distribute wash NFIs for 2,000 families, ES/NFIs for 700 households, and 1,000 dignity kits. SCI updated for considering SWAN to respond. UNICEF promised to recheck WaSH stock for the flood response.

SOS is planning to procure body and laundry soap amounting to ETB 492,000. SOS has a contingency fund estimated ETB100,000 which can be used as cash transfer to the flood-affected people. SOS is also re-programming ETB 3,000,000 for cash response. ADRA is planning to distribute cash to 2,000 households in Kalafo woreda through Awash Bank. RDRMB sent food and ES/NFIs to 1,000 displaced households in Kalafo woreda but the trucks are stuck in Gode due to flood road blockage. Still, huge gaps remain in ES/NFIs, WaSH, and food in Somali and other regions.

In Kalafo, Mustahil and Ferfer, roads are inaccessible by land for large trucks carrying supplies. The Regional President requested humanitarian partners to consider airlifting aid in inaccessible locations.

In the Afar region, the Government distributed food and NFIs for half of the displaced people. The regional DPFSPCO already requested additional food and NFIs assistance to NDRMC.

GENERAL COORDINATION

On 27 April, the National Flood Task Force was reactivated to coordinate flood preparedness and response activities at national and sub-national levels. The Flood Task Force is chaired by NDRMC and OCHA provides secretariat support.

Similarly, a Regional Flood Task Force was reactivated in the Somali region, and a joint assessment started in early May to identify needs in severely affected areas.","The flood task force is reactivated, and response activities are ongoing in the Somali region.

Excessive heavy rains in Ethiopia that started in April and peaked in May have led to flooding, displacement, loss of lives and livelihoods, as well as damage to infrastructures in different parts of the country.

According to national authorities, flooding has so far affected more than 470,000 people, of whom more than 300,000 people are displaced. The Somali region was severely hit, with nearly 80 per cent of the flood-affected and displaced people are located.

The Government of Ethiopia, the UN and other humanitarian agencies, and communities are responding to the needs of flood-affected and displaced people, although with limitations.

In the hardest-hit region Somali region, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) distributed non-food item kits to 500 displaced households. Water, sanitation, hygiene and health interventions are also ongoing with support from humanitarian partners. In Oromia region, IOM is preparing to undertake water trucking, emergency latrine interventions and partial non-food item kits distribution targeting 3,500 households. The World Food Programme (WFP) is providing food assistance.

Additional resources of US$25.6 million are urgently required to address unmet needs, including food, emergency shelter, health, water, sanitation, and hygiene services, as well as early recovery support.","The Somali region was severely hit, with nearly 80 per cent of the flood-affected and displaced people are located.

At least 7.8 million people have been receiving emergency food aid since April, up from 5.6 million at the start of the year, but a further 700,000 people in the country’s Somali region did not receive supplies “due to resource constraints” and they are now feared to be on the brink of starvation.

In July, there were 376,000 severely malnourished children under five and 3.6 million moderately malnourished children and women who were either pregnant or breastfeeding a child.

Oxfam warned that the international community – currently preoccupied with other issues such as Isis, Donald Trump and North Korea – must act urgently to prevent the crisis from turning into a “catastrophe”.

Some 228 districts, more than half the country, are now classed as “hotspot priority one” areas where people will die without help.

“The number of districts requiring immediate life-saving intervention increased to levels not seen since the height of the El Niño drought impacts in 2016,” the report said, referring to the natural weather system that increased the world’s average temperature last year, exacerbating the situation in Ethiopia.

“The 19 per cent increase in priority one districts is largely due to the deepening drought conditions, which continue to deplete water and pasture sources, significantly impacting livestock body condition and milk production.

“Milk is the main source of food and income for the majority of households in the drought-affected areas.”

About two million animals have died in the Somali region alone, according to the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO).

But, as some areas suffer from drought, others are experiencing severe flooding.

“In Oromia region, four incidents of flash floods were reported in Adama, Arsi and East Shewa zones in the second week of July, destroying more than 50 houses and more than 800 hectares of fruit and vegetable crops,” the report said.

“In Afar region, a flooding incident on 20 July has affected 204 households and damaged one school and health centre in Megale [district].”

The report warned a total of more than 1.5 million people were expected to be affected by flooding this summer with 500,000 likely to be forced to leave their homes.

There is also an ongoing outbreak of acute watery diarrhoea in six regions.

So far the international community has committed $382m towards an appeal for $948m of aid sought in January this year.

“All humanitarian partners, including donors and recipient agencies, are encouraged to inform OCHA Ethiopia of cash and in-kind contributions,” the report said.

Abdoul Karim Bah, the FAO’s deputy representative in Ethiopia, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation that it was “crucial” to provide aid between now and October when the rains are due to come.

“If we don’t act now, hunger and malnutrition will only get worse among (herding) communities,” he said.

And Manish Kumar, Oxfam’s humanitarian programme manager in Ethiopia, told The Independent in a statement that “yet another poor rainy season has pushed 700,000 more people to the verge of starvation in southern Ethiopia”.

“A deadly mix of severe malnutrition coupled with acute watery diarrhoea puts thousands of lives at risk, particularly the elderly and children,” he said.

“People will have to wait until the next rains in October for any reprieve. Urgent action is needed to prevent this crisis from turning into a catastrophe.”

Mr Kumar said the Ethiopian government was taking action to address the situation, but added that “the scale of suffering is overwhelming and rising”.

“Of the $1.25bn needed to provide emergency aid, less than 40 per cent has been donated,” he said.

“The international community needs to step up its efforts so that people can get the help they urgently need now.”

The UK has provided £30m to pay for food for 1.5 million people in the worst-affected areas. Last year, the UK funded emergency food for three million people. It is also trying to help Ethiopia improve its long-term resilience to drought as the climate changes.

Priti Patel, the UK’s International Development Secretary, who visited the country last month, told The Independent in a statement that British taxpayers had “led the way in providing a lifeline for millions of people, including in Ethiopia, who are at risk of starving to death as extreme hunger stalks East Africa”.

“However, while Britain leads, others must follow and I have lobbied the UN, other donor countries and the government of Ethiopia to act now and put funds into this emergency situation,” she said.

“We are showing our continued leadership by saving lives, providing food, water and medicine for those at imminent risk of dying from drought and conflict. Others who are funded by the UK, such as the UN, should do more.","Millions of people in Ethiopia require “immediate life-saving intervention” after a severe drought and major flash floods have devastated livestock and crops, the United Nations has warned.

But it’s going almost unnoticed.,"On Thursday, the Ethiopian government increased its count of the number of people requiring emergency food aid from 5.6 million to 7.7 million, a move that aid agencies say was long overdue. The figure is expected to rise further as southeast Ethiopia confronts another fierce drought.

But with food crises erupting across the continent and the government's budget strained by last year’s drought, the money isn't there to fight it. There could eventually be as many people in Ethiopia needing emergency food assistance as in Somalia and South Sudan combined.

Ethiopia, long associated with a devastating famine in the 1980s, returned to the headlines last year when it was hit by severe drought in the highland region, affecting 10.2 million people. Food aid poured in, the government spent hundreds of millions of its own money, and famine was averted.

AD

Now it’s the turn of the lowland region, particularly the area bordering Somalia, where a drought brought on by warming temperatures in the Indian Ocean has ravaged the flocks of the herders in the region and left people without food.

AD

With their sheep and goats mostly dead, the nomads are clustered in camps surviving on aid from the government and international agencies — but that food is about to run out.

“This response capacity that is currently holding it at bay is about to be overwhelmed,” said Charlie Mason, humanitarian director of Save the Children, which is particularly active in Ethiopia’s impoverished Somali region. “We’ve spent all the money we’ve got, basically.”

With donors focused on Somalia across the border, little international aid has found its way to the Ethiopian areas hit by that drought. “I think it’s partly because there are other priorities, and they are not signaling loudly enough to donor offices,” Mason said.

According to a document detailing Ethiopian’s humanitarian needs that was drawn up in January by the government and aid agencies, Ethiopia needs nearly $1 billion to confront the crisis, more than half of which it still lacks. That figure also does not take into account the revised estimates in the numbers of people requiring aid.

AD

AD

During last year's drought, Ethiopia came up with more than $400 million of its own money to fight off famine, but this year, it has been able to commit only $47 million, probably because of an exhausted budget.

There have also been accusations that the government is playing down the severity of the crisis to keep the country from looking bad internationally. During the earlier drought, it was months before the government admitted there was a problem, in part because Ethiopia had gained a reputation as Africa’s rising star and didn’t want to go back to being associated with drought and famine.

The contrast is clear in the bustling capital, Addis Ababa, where rainy skies and a hive of construction projects make it feel thousands of miles away from any drought. While Pizza Hut restaurants are set to soon open in the capital, thousands of children in the arid southeast suffer from acute malnutrition, and cholera is ripping through the relief camps.

The United Nations World Food Program (WFP), which is working in Ethiopia's drought-hit Somali region, has started cutting its food rations to 80 percent. It is short $121 million for its Ethiopia operation this year, and the money is expected to run out over the summer.

If no new money arrives, the rations could be cut to 420 calories for the whole day — the equivalent of a burger. The government’s food contribution will probably suffer a similar fate.

“It’s stretching the humanitarian community,” WFP regional spokeswoman Challiss McDonough said, referring to the string of crises in the Horn of Africa and elsewhere on the continent. “I don’t think of it as donor fatigue. Quite frankly, the donors have been extremely generous, continuing to be so — but they are overwhelmed.”

AD

There is also the fact that the Horn of Africa has been incredibly unlucky these past few years in terms of weather. Though famine was averted, many parts of the Ethiopian highlands are still recovering from the 2015-2016 drought, which was attributed to the El Niño ocean-warming phenomenon in the Pacific.

AD

The U.N. World Meteorological Organization said Friday that there is a 50 percent to 60 percent chance that the Pacific will see another strong warming trend this year, which means Ethiopia’s highlands will be slammed again at a time when world resources are scarcer than ever.

“The droughts are coming more frequently and more often and they are worse — and that’s climate change. That’s very, very clear,” McDonough said. “You talk to any farmer how are the rains now compared to 20-30 years ago, they see a difference in their lifetimes, particularly the older ones.”

AD

Even while they have one of the smallest carbon footprints on the globe, herders’ fragile existence in the arid climate of the Horn of Africa is probably the most threatened by climate change.","The figure is expected to rise further as southeast Ethiopia confronts another fierce drought.

Since November 2016, families across the Somali region have lost a great number of livestock, which are the foundation of livelihoods of traditional pastoralists — the majority of people living here. These recurrent climate shocks have sparked ripple effects across the region, as families fight to keep their animals alive, access food to survive and ward off the many diseases that often accompany such a fragile humanitarian situation.

More investment needed to fight climate shocks

To raise awareness of this dire situation and the critical need for more investment in programmes that promote climate resilience, three UN Food Agency Chiefs travelled to Ethiopia from 1 to 4 September. They included the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)’s Director-General José Graziano da Silva, the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD)’s President Gilbert F.

Safe water supply, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) services are a crucial part of preventing disease and protecting human health during infectious disease outbreaks, including the current coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19). Yet these same disease outbreaks place substantial stress on the utilities responsible for delivery.

The staff-intensive nature of utilities makes them particularly susceptible to labor force reductions due to staff illness, physical distancing or quarantine. With budgets already tight, utilities may find themselves constrained even further as affected households struggle to pay for services. And reduced transportation and potentially intensified customs restrictions can disrupt supply chains, leading to shortages of the chemicals and parts that utilities require to continue operating.

World Bank

That’s why resources from the World Bank’s Second Urban Water Supply and Sanitation Project in Ethiopia have been urgently mobilized to help overcome these challenges and maintain an adequate level of service during the response to the COVID-19 pandemic. This project supports essential water supply and sanitation services for more than 3 million Ethiopians with:

623,000 people in urban areas with access to improved water sources;

61,000 new piped household water connections;

Safe management of excreta for 2.7 million people in urban areas;

More than 50,000 sewer connections in Addis Ababa; and

1,000 public latrines

Under the project, the World Bank is working closely with the Addis Ababa Water and Sewerage Authority (AAWSA) to further increase water supply. Activities include borehole rehabilitation for existing groundwater sources across the city as well as the replacement of 20 water pumps in order to provide safe and reliable services to densely populated areas.

This project is also helping the AAWSA learn from and apply best practices and expertise of water utilities across the world. Some of the lessons so far include the importance of constantly updating emergency planning procedures when events are moving rapidly, identifying vital supplies and ensuring that suppliers can still provide them, and implementing a communications plan that keeps staff, customers and other stakeholders informed of developments.

Outside of Addis Ababa, the project is working with water utilities in 22 of Ethiopia’s largest cities to provide funding and technical support for essential tasks. Procuring chemicals and reagents that remove impurities and maintaining back-up power generators may not be immediately obvious interventions for a pandemic response. But they are, however, extremely important to provide water fit for consumption.

The World Bank is also working with the government to identify additional border cities that need critical support. These cities regularly receive an influx of travelers and goods – most of Ethiopia’s supplies come by land from neighboring countries, which have higher COVID19 caseloads – so these border communities require support and WASH services to mitigate the spread of the virus.

Both AAWSA and secondary city utilities also benefit from the hard work of sanitation workers in small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Ethiopia’s sanitation workforce bridges the gap between sanitation infrastructure and the provision of public services. The World Bank is working with government to mitigate occupational and environmental health risks for these essential members of the response efforts.

The nature of such complex work and the rapidly changing picture of localized outbreaks and resource shortfalls mean that coordination is vital. That’s why the World Bank has established a WASH COVID coordination platform that meets virtually three times a week to help the government, local entities and NGOs work closely together. This mechanism means they all can provide updates as well as coordinate complementary support to ensure the optimal use of resources and timely responses.

World Bank

The Global Water Security and Sanitation Partnership (GWSP) is supporting Ethiopia as a priority country, where some of its most innovative interventions and approaches are tested, refined and scaled-up. GWSP has enabled the project to conduct rapid sanitation assessments for all of the cities supported to identify a pipeline of sanitation investments tailored to each city’s needs. In addition, GWSP support is helping cities develop business plans and strategies to improve operational efficiency and reduce the losses from water leaks, services not being invoiced to customers, or both.

GWSP has also supported field-level leadership trainings in partnership with the Vitens Water Worx Project, a collective of public water operators, along with international study exchanges to help embed best practice into implementation.

In parallel, the recently approved COVID-19 Emergency Response and Health Systems Preparedness Project is supporting communications and information outreach activities to encourage behavioral change around handwashing and sanitation. The One WASH—Consolidated Water Supply, Sanitation, and Hygiene Account Project is also funding the dissemination of hygiene promotion and behavior change materials. The business community are playing their part too – handwashing stations are now positioned at the entrance to many banks so that customers can maintain good hygiene habits.

Helping water utilities deliver clean and reliable water, providing sanitation to those who need it most, and promoting handwashing behavior change – these are actions that can help protect people in the short term and help prevent outbreaks in the years to come.","Water utilities rarely grab the headlines, but their ability to keep water flowing is among the most important contributions in a pandemic response.

Months have gone by since the electricity generator shut down in Rob Gebeye, a small mountain community in the Oromia region, and yet secondary school teacher Tullu Abebe still gets nervous when he cannot hear the rumble of the diesel engine that pumped the village’s water for years.

“Then I remember that the sun is pumping the water now. It’s still very surprising,” Abebe says.

The diesel generator was replaced in 2018 by a 36-panel solar water pump, which generates electricity to draw water from the community borehole up to a storage tank. The savings on diesel costs have cut the water rate fee per household down to $0.30 per month, less than half the previous $0.70. It also enabled the community to buy a storage tank with twice the capacity and provide clean water to almost all the 4,000 residents in the community.

The Rob Gebeye solar water pumping plant is part of the rural water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) component of Ethiopia’s extensive One WASH National Program. The African Development Bank contributed more than a third of the funding for the program, which operates under a Consolidated WASH Account – a pool of financing provided by the Government of Ethiopia and its development partners.

One WASH, launched in 2014, is increasingly seen as critical to helping the country fight off the coronavirus pandemic. Its original objectives included improving the health and well-being of rural and urban communities by increasing sustainable access to water supplies and sanitation and the adoption of good hygiene practices.

“The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the way society perceives the importance of water development and sanitation, and has brought to light the relevance of the Bank Group’s efforts to fix the issues that enable sustained benefits from water development and sanitation, for the health and well-being of the people of Africa,” says Wambui Gichuri, Director of the Water Development and Sanitation Department at the Bank.

In Ethiopia, the Bank and other partners’ funding is supporting an ambitious nationwide program intended to serve 110 million people in Africa’s second-most populous country. Other partners include the World Bank, Britain’s Department for International Development (DFID), the government of Finland and UNICEF.

A Water.org study found that while 42% of Ethiopians have access to clean water, only a tenth of those people have access to adequate sanitation services. The One WASH program aims to increase access to improved water supplies and sanitation services for residents of participating districts, wards and medium and small towns across the country.

The Bank has provided $178 million to the first phase of the program, out of the total budget of $463 million. The Bank-hosted Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Initiative Trust Fund has extended grants of up to $7 million for One WASH projects. The program focused on serving rural communities frequently plagued by droughts, malnutrition, and waterborne diseases.

“Sustainable water and sanitation services in the rural areas strengthen education, maternal and child health, nutrition and livelihoods. In focusing on the rural environment, we address the WASH needs of over 60% of the population,” says Dr. Beshah Mogesse, Commissioner for Ethiopia’s Water Development Commission. “This has positioned us to better respond to the threat of the coronavirus.”

In addition to solar powered water pumps, One WASH is also embracing safe water development systems including boreholes, hand pumps, diesel pumps, gravity pumps, solar pumps, and electric grid power to bring safe, potable water to Ethiopians. Solar pumps offer low-cost, environmentally friendly and sustainable water delivery, not only in Ethiopia but across the continent, says Osward Chanda, Manager of the Bank’s Water Security and Sanitation Division.

“We want to use solar and other renewable systems wherever we can,” Chanda says. “Renewables reduce the cost of access to water for communities, while mitigating the effects of climate change.”

Solomon Abera, a representative of the Wuchale District in which Rob Gebeye is situated, says waterborne diseases that were common among children have virtually disappeared. Consequently, attendance at Rob Gebeye secondary school, especially that of girls, has increased by more than 80 percent.

“The One WASH National Program did not plan for the COVID-19 pandemic,” says Water Commissioner Mogesse. “But it has prepared us to fight the pandemic better than we would have been without the program, especially in the unserved rural communities.”

The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic continues to have a firm grip on the world and it is getting progressively clear that people with minimum access to essential services such as water will be on the receiving end.

African countries such as Ethiopia have been facing water shortage, poor sanitation and lack of access to clean water sources for long. At least 60-80 per cent of communicable diseases are attributed to limited access to safe water and inadequate sanitation and hygiene services.

Only 42 per cent of the population has access to clean water and only 11 per cent of that number has access to adequate sanitation services in Ethiopia, according to a study conducted by Water.org. In rural areas of the country, these figures are even lower — as a result, health problems are common among villagers and their livestock.

National population – 104,957,000

People living below poverty line (BPL) – 30.8 %

Percentage of rural population lacking access to water – 68.94%

Percentage of rural population lacking access to safe sanitation – 95.82%

Major water resources – 12 major basins (8 rivers, 1 lake & 3 dry basins)

Source: Charity Water Ethiopia

According to another study conducted by an organisation, one-third of the population there did not have access to safe water. About 31 per cent of Ethiopian population (32 million) relied on unsafe water for their daily needs, according to the Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP), a global database of water, sanitation and hygiene data.

Another 28 per cent had limited access; meaning the water was likely safe, but it took over 30 minutes to retrieve it because of distance to the source, overcrowding there or both. More than 62 million people live without basic access to safe drinking water in Ethiopia.

In fact, Ethiopia alone accounts for 7.5 per cent of the global water crisis.

The basic act of washing hands, needed particularly to keep the virus SARS-CoV-2 at bay, is challenging in several developing countries like Ethiopia. According to the JMP data, 41 per cent of households have no hand-washing facility at all.

About 51 per cent have the facility, but no reliable source of clean water or soap. The remaining 8 percent have ‘basic’ access, meaning they have access to a facility with soap and water.

This makes maintaining healthy hygiene and sanitation is difficult for most communities in Ethiopia.

Ethiopia is home to many major rivers amongst sub-Saharan African countries with a likely average of 1,575 cubic metre of available water resources per capital per year. Though plenty of water is available in the country, only 3 per cent of water resources can be accessible.

The demand for drinking water in rural areas is mostly fulfilled using groundwater through shallow wells, deep wells and spring wells. Those who have no access to water supply, usually obtain water from rivers, unprotected springs and hand-dug wells. To add to their woes, several rivers there are highly polluted which makes it unfit for drinking, handwashing and other household purpose.

The main reason for river or surface water pollution in Ethiopia is fast population growth, uncontrolled urbanisation and industrialisation and poor waste management practices. The rivers in Addis Ababa, including the big and the small Akaki, are simply used as a receptacle of all kinds of wastes released in the city.

Addis Abba holds about 65 per cent (more than 2,000) industries of the country and most of them are located along river banks. More than 90 per cent of these industries do not have any kind of treatment facilities and therefore, they discharge their solid and liquid waste into nearby rivers or stream.

The biota of most of these rivers has been destroyed. Further, most research studies show that the river water quality is so bad, it is not even fit for irrigation and livestock washing.

Ethiopia is also highly prone to drought. Clean water is the most basic need to combat water-borne diseases, particularly COVID-19. Clean water is also vital in fight against future pandemics.","African countries such as Ethiopia have been facing water shortage, poor sanitation and lack of access to clean water sources for long.

African countries such as Ethiopia have been facing water shortage, poor sanitation and lack of access to clean water sources for long. At least 60-80 per cent of communicable diseases are attributed to limited access to safe water and inadequate sanitation and hygiene services.

Only 42 per cent of the population has access to clean water and only 11 per cent of that number has access to adequate sanitation services in Ethiopia, according to a study conducted by Water.org. In rural areas of the country, these figures are even lower — as a result, health problems are common among villagers and their livestock.

National population – 104,957,000

People living below poverty line (BPL) – 30.8 %

Percentage of rural population lacking access to water – 68.94%

Percentage of rural population lacking access to safe sanitation – 95.82%

Major water resources – 12 major basins (8 rivers, 1 lake & 3 dry basins)

According to another study conducted by an organisation, one-third of the population there did not have access to safe water. About 31 per cent of Ethiopian population (32 million) relied on unsafe water for their daily needs, according to the Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP), a global database of water, sanitation and hygiene data.

Another 28 per cent had limited access; meaning the water was likely safe, but it took over 30 minutes to retrieve it because of distance to the source, overcrowding there or both. More than 62 million people live without basic access to safe drinking water in Ethiopia.

In fact, Ethiopia alone accounts for 7.5 per cent of the global water crisis.

The basic act of washing hands, needed particularly to keep the virus SARS-CoV-2 at bay, is challenging in several developing countries like Ethiopia. According to the JMP data, 41 per cent of households have no hand-washing facility at all.

About 51 per cent have the facility, but no reliable source of clean water or soap. The remaining 8 percent have ‘basic’ access, meaning they have access to a facility with soap and water.

This makes maintaining healthy hygiene and sanitation is difficult for most communities in Ethiopia.

Ethiopia is home to many major rivers amongst sub-Saharan African countries with a likely average of 1,575 cubic metre of available water resources per capital per year. Though plenty of water is available in the country, only 3 per cent of water resources can be accessible.

The demand for drinking water in rural areas is mostly fulfilled using groundwater through shallow wells, deep wells and spring wells. Those who have no access to water supply, usually obtain water from rivers, unprotected springs and hand-dug wells. To add to their woes, several rivers there are highly polluted which makes it unfit for drinking, handwashing and other household purpose.

The main reason for river or surface water pollution in Ethiopia is fast population growth, uncontrolled urbanisation and industrialisation and poor waste management practices. The rivers in Addis Ababa, including the big and the small Akaki, are simply used as a receptacle of all kinds of wastes released in the city.

Addis Abba holds about 65 per cent (more than 2,000) industries of the country and most of them are located along river banks. More than 90 per cent of these industries do not have any kind of treatment facilities and therefore, they discharge their solid and liquid waste into nearby rivers or stream.

The biota of most of these rivers has been destroyed. Further, most research studies show that the river water quality is so bad, it is not even fit for irrigation and livestock washing.

Ethiopia is also highly prone to drought. Clean water is the most basic need to combat water-borne diseases, particularly COVID-19. Clean water is also vital in fight against future pandemics.

157,https://www.powermag.com/rains-complicate-ethiopian-hydro-dam-dispute/,Rains Complicate Ethiopian Hydro Dam Dispute,"Ethiopia says it had reached a “major common understanding” with Egypt and Sudan related to the first filling and annual operation of the 6.4-GW Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), paving the way to a “breakthrough agreement” in the contentious dispute that is primarily about use of the River Nile’s waters.

As POWER reported in depth earlier this month, tensions between Ethiopia and Egypt related to filling of the GERD reservoir on the Blue Nile—a significant Nile tributary—escalated after U.S.-mediated talks collapsed in February. Egypt recently sought intervention by the United Nation’s Security Council, warning the dispute could “provoke crises and conflict that [could] further destabilize an already troubled region.” Ethiopia has continued pushing for a resolution brokered by the African Union (AU).

According to a July 21 statement from Ethiopia’s Office of the Prime Minister, the three countries agreed to continue talks during a recent virtual meeting hosted by the AU and observed by the European Union (EU) and the U.S. “Accordingly, Ethiopia, Egypt, and Sudan agreed for further technical discussions on the filling to continue in the AU-led process and proceed to a comprehensive agreement,” the office said.

However, the office also said that current rainfall and runoff in the region have made it “conducive” to achieve first filling of the massive dam. The ministry noted that the “dam under construction is already overtopping.”

Ethiopia’s push to unilaterally fill the dam has been a major point of contention in the decade-long dispute. Tensions escalated again last week after satellite images released on July 14 by U.S. firm Maxar Technologies showed water beginning to fill in a reservoir behind the dam.

Ethiopia’s Water Minister Seleshi Bekele on July 16 reportedly stressed that the water levels in the reservoir were owing to heavy rainfall, and not due to a conscious efforts to fill the dam. But, as reported by Ethiopian state-owned media, Bekele also said first filling of the dam will allow first tests of two turbines. While the statement on July 21 did not specify how much water is now in the reservoir, Ethiopia has previously said the first-year target was 4.9 billion cubic meters of water. Bekele reportedly said 560 meters above sea level is the height required to hold that amount of water. The dam is capable of holding 74 billion cubic meters of water to enable 6.4 GW of power.

Egypt responded to the images last week by demanding an urgent clarification. Sudan, meanwhile, raised alarms that water levels were dropping along the river. “It was evident from the flow meters in the al-Deim border station with Ethiopia that there is a retreat in the water levels, equivalent to 90 million cubic meters [three billion cubic feet] per day, confirming the closure of the gates of the Renaissance Dam,” Sudan’s Ministry of Irrigation and Water Resources said in a statement.

Foreign Policy on Wednesday reported that the Trump administration is mulling withholding some aid to Ethiopia if negotiations hit another impasse. Citing unnamed sources, the news magazine also suggested the project has fueled divisions and confusion over handling of the emerging crisis by the U.S. Treasury and State departments.

Still, South Africa’s President Cyril Ramaphosa, who chaired the AU virtual meeting on Tuesday, said on Twitter that “The trilateral negotiations remain on track.” He described the meeting as “constructive,” and thanked all parties involved for their commitment to “finding African solutions to African problems.”

On Tuesday, meanwhile, the Egyptian presidency noted in a statement that “It was agreed, at the conclusion of the summit, to continue negotiations and focus for the time being on giving priority to developing a binding legal agreement on the rules for filling and operating the Renaissance Dam.”

Ethiopia says the hydropower project is crucial to its economic development. Egypt is worried the dam will affect flow of the Nile, its main source of fresh water.

THE DAM

The $4 billion Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) was announced in early 2011, as Egypt was in political upheaval following a popular uprising that toppled former President Hosni Mubarak.

The dam is the centerpiece of Ethiopia’s bid to become Africa’s biggest power exporter, with a projected capacity of more than 6,000 megawatts.

Ethiopia has said it will start filling the reservoir behind the dam in 2020, though construction has been hit by delays.

The first stage of the filling process is expected to take two years and bring the water level in the reservoir to 595 meters out of an eventual 632 meters.

NILE WATERS

The Nile Basin river system flows through 11 countries. The Blue Nile and White Nile merge in Sudan before flowing into Egypt and towards the Mediterranean.

Egypt currently bases its share of the river’s waters on a 1959 deal that gave it 55.5 billion cubic meters water annually, and Sudan 18.5 bcm.

Other countries were not given allocations at that time. Ethiopia was not party to the agreement and does not recognize it.

EGYPT’S POSITION

Egypt, which has a rapidly growing population nearing 100 million, relies on the Nile for around 90% of its fresh water.

Even without taking the dam into account, the largely desert country is short of water. It imports about half its food products and recycles about 25 bcm of water annually.

Egypt accuses Ethiopia of not factoring in the risk of drought conditions such as those that affected the Nile Basin in the late 1970s and early 1980s.

While acknowledging such a scenario is unlikely, Egypt says it could lose more than one million jobs and $1.8 billion in economic production annually.

It therefore wants the first, two-year stage of the filling process to be extendable, and for Ethiopia to guarantee it 40 bcm per year after the first stage is completed.

ETHIOPIA’S POSITION

Ethiopia, with a population of more than 100 million people, accuses Egypt of trying to maintain a colonial-era grip over the Nile’s waters.

Addis Ababa says Cairo is trying to hold the project hostage by imposing rules over the filling and operation of the dam.

It says it is taking the interests of Egypt and Sudan - the other downstream nation - into account, and that Egypt’s requirement of a guaranteed 40 bcm is unrealistic.

It also says that while it could fill the reservoir in two to three years, it made a concession by proposing a four to seven year process.

Ethiopia has repeatedly rejected Egypt’s suggestion of a fourth party mediator, saying Cairo is trying to sidestep three-way discussions.

TALKS

Both sides have accused each other of delaying negotiations, which resumed in Cairo and Khartoum in September and October, before stalling again.

After Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi met Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed on the sidelines of a summit in Russia in October, the two sides agreed to restart technical talks.

The COVID-19 pandemic and disparate international response to the deadly virus has put diplomacy on a standstill. International organizations, including the United Nations, have virtually shuttered their offices. Bilateral engagements have also dwindled amid travel restrictions and countries turn their attentions inward to managing the Corona virus.

Perhaps one exception is North-East Africa region, where heightened tensions and diplomatic squabble is quietly playing out in the background following stalled negotiations between Ethiopia, Sudan and Egypt over the filling and operation of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD). Egyptian officials are jet-setting across Africa and the Middle East to shore up pressure on Ethiopia.

This is not surprising. The Nile, one of the longest river basins in Africa, is home to a little over half a billion people, who depend on its waters for their livelihood. The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, a major development project on the Nile river, is playing a central role in water development discourse with tremendous potential for regional integration and economic development. However, progress on reasonable sharing and utilization of the Nile waters has eluded the Nile Basin countries thanks to unseemly politicking by Egypt and its insistence on maintaining externally imposed colonial-era agreements that are contrary to the interests of other countries.

Ethiopian and Egyptian divergence over the GERD began in 2011 when Addis Abeba launched the project. It returned to international spotlight in September 2019 after Egyptian President Abdelfattah Al Sisi used his speech at the United Nations to frame the Dam as a threat to his country's ""water security"" and enlisted the international community, specifically the President of the United States, to personally intervene. Subsequently, the two countries and Sudan agreed to involve the U.S. government and the World Bank, as observers, in their trilateral technical negotiations to reach an amicable agreement on the initial filling and operation of the GERD. However, the negotiations broke down after promising start and much progress.

Ethiopia and Egypt are back to trading accusations over failure to reach an agreement. The questionable role of American facilitators further exacerbated diplomatic wrangling, public mistrust and politicization.

Egypt has cunningly built the narrative that it is the only natural benefactor of the Nile waters; that the Ethiopian Dam poses an existential threat to the Egyptian people; that the issue of water security is a matter of human rights for Egypt, and that given the threat of water scarcity amidst rapidly growing population even an iota of its share of the Nile water should not be reduced. (Egypt currently receives 55.5 billion cubic meters per annum under the 1959 agreement between Khartoum, Cairo and Great Britain. Ethiopia was not party to that agreement.)

It is time for Ethiopia and the Nile basin countries to straighten the facts and unmask the flagrant injustice and correct the hegemonic Egyptian narrative. For one, the Nile water is a resource and wealth for the over 500 million people living in and around the river system. In Ethiopia, where about 86 percent of the Blue Nile water originates, it is a lifeline for more than 40 million people who eke out a living in the basin areas. The river also covers 63 percent of land in Sudan and provides 77 percent of fresh water for more than 45million people. Hence, no country should have an exclusive right to the Nile's water on the basis of obsolete colonial treaties.

The Egyptian stranglehold on the Nile waters is unacceptable. Egypt has twice ignored protests from upper riparian countries when it built the Aswan High Dam, and two other colossal projects, namely the Toshka and Al-slam canals that took the Nile water from its natural course in contravention of established norms. Yet, Cairo seeks to dictate what other riparian states can and can't do with the Nile waters. Basin countries must now come together anew to challenge this hypocrisy and seek a judicious and equitable use of the Nile waters.

Population pressures

Contrary to the deceptive portrayal of Egyptian politicians and media, Ethiopia or all Nile Basin countries have no illusion to understand the economic and psychological significance of the Nile river for the people of Egypt. It is also unnatural to think that Ethiopians have a desire to block the water from flowing downstream or make the Egyptian people and civilization perish. The fear-mongering narrative is not only politically expedient, it is also intended to sow discord in the region.

One thing must be crystal clear: In this day and age, no one would be allowed to starve and perish from deprivation of water resource. All the same, it is important to understand that upper riparian states face tremendous demographic and developmental pressures. They need to feed a growing population; respond to rapid urbanization; modernize subsistence agriculture and light their hospitals and education facilities using hydropower.

Demographic change has always been the primary driving force for social, economic and technological advancement. The Nile basin, with more than 500 million people, is heavily impacted by population growth, in which the youth constitute the largest portion. Generally, demand for water is expected to increase in the coming decades as population growth raises water consumption levels, not to mention added demand from new investments, particularly in agriculture and manufacturing.

Egypt often points to its projected population growth to assert its exclusive use of the river Nile. However, all basin countries, including Ethiopia, can make an equally compelling argument given their similar or even more pronounced population explosions. Ethiopia and Egypt are also arguably more heavily dependent on the Nile river than any other basin country and hence there should not be an exclusive case to make than cooperation for fair and equitable sharing of the Nile water.

Access to electricity as a human right

If Egypt is worried about ""water security,"" abject poverty is a matter of existence for millions of Ethiopians, who depend on recurrent humanitarian assistance and safety net programs. The dire straits of the economy and demands from fast-growing population makes the use of water resources ever more critical. Energy production is a key pillar for the country's economic development.

Still, above and beyond aspirations of development, access to electricity, in and of itself, is a fundamental human right. Under the globally agreed 2030 Agenda, access to energy is a vital, cross-cutting element of infrastructure that is critical for achieving poverty reduction in all its forms and many of the Sustainable Development Goals. However, recent rates of growth in electricity access indicate that Africa will not meet this target. Furthermore, the current number of people without electricity is expected to continue with Africa's population boom.

Egypt, as a state party to the SDGs as well as the African Union Agenda 2063, is fully aware that efficient utilization of water resources is central to achieve many of the goals set by these development targets.

For context, Egypt, the main beneficiary of the Nile river, has 100 percent electricity access while nearly 60 million Ethiopians still live off-the-grid. According to a recent World Bank and African Development Forum joint Study, a number of other Nile basin countries have less than 25 percent access to electricity. Only 25 to 50 percent of Kenyan and Sudanese households have access to electricity.

If African nations want to see their economies transform, the issue of electricity must be tackled head-on as access to reliable electricity is the backbone of any modern economy.

To be clear, this does not justify arresting the flow of the Nile waters. And that is not what upper riparian states are demanding. Rather to apply the principles of equitable and reasonable utilization of the waters to allow the people of the basin at least an opportunity to have a light bulb above their heads.

GERD is at the heart Ethiopia's development aspirations and poverty reduction strategy. But it also offers many benefits to the other riparian states, ranging from energy export to flood management as well as silt reduction at downstream dams in Sudan and Egypt.

""The Dam will greatly reduce the problems of silt and sediment that consistently affect dams in Egypt and Sudan,"" the late Prime Minister, Meles Zenawi, noted at the launch of the project. ""When the Dam becomes operational, communities all along the riverbanks and surrounding areas, particularly in Sudan, will be permanently relieved from centuries of flooding.""

He touted further benefits to Sudan and Egypt, including the potential for increased power supplies and reduction in wastage from evaporation.

Water security for Egypt or Ethiopia?

The principle of ""water security"" must be understood as the right of all Nile Basin States to reliable access to and use of the river system for health, agriculture, livelihoods, production and environment. It is not exclusive to a single country in the Basin.

According to reliable scholars and scientific studies, Egypt is more endowed than Ethiopia with groundwater resources. For example, from the Nubian aquifer alone, Egypt can harness some 150,000 BCM of water. By contrast, Ethiopia has only an available surface water in the order of 122 BCM, 70 percent of which is generated in the Nile basin.

The studies further indicate that Egypt can produce a fresh water in the order of 5250 BCM only if 100 meter thickness of the ground water storage is utilized. In addition to this, unlike landlocked Ethiopia, Egypt could access additional water resources through desalination from its huge coastline, using advanced and yet cheaper technology. Therefore, an efficient way of water use coupled with reduction of wastages through traditional agricultural and urban practices would enhance the available water resource in Egypt as well as other riparian countries.

The way forward

Ethiopia had the full trust on the observers, the U.S. Treasury and the World Bank, as well as the negotiating parties, Egypt and Sudan, to take the issue of filling and operation of the Dam one step closer to finalization.

However, Egyptian intransigence has once again led to stumbles in the tripartite negotiations. The negotiations were further complicated by other geopolitical considerations, very much attached to the interest of Egypt, and yet far from Ethiopia and the Nile basin countries. Still, there is only one feasible way out of the GERD stalemate. All riparian states, including Egypt, must agree to manage the Nile waters in a more sustainable, efficient and equitable manner than the hegemonic efforts to politicize and internationalize the issue.

Egypt's ongoing efforts to envelope multiple actors, including the League of Arab States and the European Union, who are not directly affected, will only stifle the dialogue. Egypt has finally turned its gaze to Africa as the last stop on the list of its diplomatic offensive. This shows not only the place and attention Egypt gives for Africa and its political and legal instruments but also the Egyptian tendency to try and impose hegemonic will on the upper riparian states.

A good illustration of this Egyptian contempt for and lack of trust in African mechanisms is the Cooperative Framework Agreement (CFA) negotiated among ten Nile basin countries in 2010. The agreement was signed by all, except Egypt and Sudan.

Four of the signatories have ratified the framework through their legal mechanisms. Egypt refuses to abide by the negotiated agreement, yet it insists on the implementation of a colonial-era agreement. President Al-Sisi sought U.S. and World Bank intervention at a time when he served as the Chairperson of the African Union, which has prioritized African solutions for African problems.

Despite lack of any treaty obligations, Ethiopia has nevertheless persisted in upholding principles of causing no significant harm. It should spare no efforts to reduce impacts on lower riparian countries. The three countries are closer, more than ever before, to reach an agreement on initial filling and operation of the GERD. This is no time to resurrect technical details already settled, including dam safety concerns, by the Panel of Experts.

It is, however, high time to restart good-faith negotiations, within the purview of the Nile Basin Initiative and the legal and political instruments of the African Union. If Egypt truly believes in being part of the African family, there is no reason to look elsewhere for deliverance. Ethiopia must insist on Africanizing the GERD negotiations and for Egypt to respect regional bodies and instruments.

Furthermore, Ethiopia should continue to hold firm in resisting any and all external pressure on this African project, solely built and financed by Ethiopians. That includes possible offers for compensation during the filling period as it undermines in monetary terms the value of GERD and obliges Ethiopia to compromise on its legal right. AS

[Dr. Mohamed S. Helal, Assistant Professor of Law, Moritz College of Law and Affiliated Faculty, Mershon Center for International Security Studies, The Ohio State University, and is currently serving as a legal counsel with the Egyptian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.]

For almost a decade, Egypt, Ethiopia, and Sudan have been engaged in negotiations on the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD). The principal purpose of these negotiations was to conclude a treaty to govern both the filling of the GERD reservoir and the operation of the dam. Although I’ve negotiated several treaties as a government lawyer and studied many more as an academic, the negotiations on the GERD were particularly educational and enriching. Never in my years of service had I witnessed a process where the technical and scientific aspects were as complex, or where the political stakes were higher, or where the heavy hand of history was as overbearing.

In this three-part post, I will share my thoughts about these negotiations. Part I provides an overview of the decade-long negotiations on the GERD. Part II focuses on the final rounds of negotiations that were attended by United States and the World Bank, and which led to the drafting, through U.S. facilitation and with technical input from the World Bank, of a final agreement on the GERD, which was initialed by Egypt, but that Ethiopia has rejected. Finally, Part III discusses the legal framework governing these talks with a special focus on the 2015 Agreement on Declaration of Principles. Needless to say, nothing in this post should be attributed to the government of Egypt. These are my personal reflections.

Before retracing the path of the GERD negotiations, an introductory comment is apposite:

As I reflect on what were truly labyrinthine negotiations on the GERD, I am left with the heart-wrenching sensation that unfolding before us is a “tragedy of disappointment” (the phrase is Woodrow Wilson’s, not mine). If these talks were guided by science and law, we would have reached an agreement years ago. Indeed, the path towards a win-win solution is clear. GERD is a hydropower project. It is designed to contribute to Ethiopia’s developmental and poverty-alleviation plans. Egypt, on the other hand, is a water-impoverished nation of 100 million souls that is entirely dependent on the Nile. If the negotiations were exclusively aimed at bringing the GERD online to enable Ethiopia to expeditiously and sustainably generate hydropower, without harming downstream riparians, then an agreement is attainable. Indeed, as I discuss in Part II, a fair and balanced agreement brokered by impartial actors is already on the table.

The tragedy, however, is that the negotiations are not primarily driven by either science or law. Political turmoil hindered the negotiations (all three countries experienced some form of regime change during the past ten years), domestic political considerations and electioneering, especially in Ethiopia which is holding an election this year, made grandstanding expedient and compromise harder, a (wholly imagined) sense of historical injustice and (an equally illusory) sense of entitlement, popular perceptions and misperceptions, cultural mythology and even folklore, all combined to turn the negotiations into a zero-sum game. Moreover, although the talks were focused on the GERD, it became apparent that, for Ethiopia, the GERD was not only a hydropower dam, but also an instrument to establish and codify an unregulated right to exploit the riches of the Blue Nile and construct upstream projects.

I am no idealist. Going into the negotiations, everyone realized that these factors would push and pull the parties and influence their positions. However, I had hoped that, especially on Ethiopia’s part, there would be greater political will to reach an agreement and a greater preparedness to adopt a cooperative posture. Instead, what we in Egypt have seen is unrelenting unilateralism. Construction of the dam commenced without informing or consulting downstream riparians; the environmental impact assessments and socio-economic studies that are required by international law to determine the transboundary effects of the dam have not been undertaken; there are no measures in place to mitigate the adverse effects of the dam; there are no guarantees that the dam is structurally safe; and now, the filling of the GERD reservoir is expected to begin in 100 days in the absence of agreed rules on the filling and operation of the dam.

As such, we are so close, yet so far. An agreement is on the table and within reach, but the political will to grasp this opportunity is lacking. Nonetheless, I remain hopeful that a breakthrough may still be possible. Before considering the way forward, however, let’s first briefly revisit the past ten years of negotiations on the GERD.

Building a Dam in the Dark

GERD was a closely guarded secret. Aside from the occasional leak in the local media, downstream states had virtually no knowledge of Ethiopia’s plans to construct the GERD or of the size and design specifications of this dam.

Although it was understood that Ethiopia had been considering, for several decades, building a hydropower facility somewhere in the general vicinity of the GERD, it quickly became apparent, once more information was made available, that this dam was going to be exponentially larger than anything previously conceived. In 1964, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation proposed building a dam in that area that could store between 11-16 billion cubic meters (BCM) of water. Similarly, in 2007, the Eastern Nile Technical Regional Office (ENTRO), which is a part of the Nile Basin Initiative, issued a report on the feasibility of constructing what Ethiopia called the “Border Hydropower Project”, which was designed to hold slightly over 14BCM of water.

The GERD, however, is a much grander undertaking. With a maximum water storage capacity of 74BCM and a power-production capacity of 6450MW, the GERD will become the largest hydropower dam in Africa. To put things into perspective, in terms of hydropower production, the GERD is more than twice as large as two of America’s largest and most iconic dams, the Hoover Dam and the Robert Moses Niagara Falls Dam. Its water storage capacity is equally impressive. At its maximum capacity of 74BCM, the GERD will store 150% of the average annual flow of the Blue Nile, which is 49BCM, and its reservoir will be larger than Lake Mead, America’s largest human-made lake.

The Warning Bell: The Report of the International Panel of Experts (IPoE)

In response to concerns expressed by downstream riparians that they had been left in the dark about the GERD, Ethiopia agreed to establish a panel composed of ten experts (two from each of the three countries, and four neutral experts). The IPoE’s mandate was to “review the design documents of the GERD, provide transparent information sharing and to solicit understanding of the benefits and costs accrued to the three countries and impacts if any of the GERD on the two downstream countries.” After a whole year, during which it met six times and conducted four field visits to the GERD, the IPoE issued its report on May 31, 2013. The findings documented in this report were deeply troubling.

For starters, the IPoE described the “Hydrological and Reservoir Simulation Study” that was undertaken to assess the downstream impacts of the GERD as being “very basic, and not yet at a level of detail, sophistication and reliability that would befit a development of this magnitude, importance and with such regional impact.” The report also highlighted that the “operating rules are not given for the existing dams/hydropower installations and very little detail on the planned operation” of the GERD was provided. Therefore, the IPoE recommended undertaking “a more comprehensive assessment of downstream impacts of the GERD, based on a sophisticated water resources/hydrological system simulation model.”

Similarly, the Transboundary Environmental Impact Assessment was considered to be “too general to provide any effective basis for quantitative impact assessment.” Indeed, the IPoE expressed concern that “the most important water quality issue, which concerns the reduction of dissolved oxygen because of the decay of flooded vegetation and soil, is not adequately addressed.” It also noted that “the potential negative impact on recession agriculture and riparian forest as well as impact on seasonal replenishment of groundwater along the Blue Nile and the main Nile are not addressed.” Moreover, the IPoE found that “an economic assessment of the GERD project from a regional perspective which takes account of the project’s benefits and costs in downstream countries” was not undertaken. Therefore, the IPoE recommended “that a trans-boundary impact assessment is undertaken for the downstream impact zones within Sudan and Egypt.”

Equally disconcerting was the fact that the IPoE found serious flaws with the design specifications of the GERD, which cast doubt over the dam’s structural safety and stability. The IPoE noted that “structural measures might be needed to stabilize the foundation to achieve the required safety against sliding.” This recommendation reflected the fact that the IPoE had found that the “shear strength parameters used in the analysis are considered too optimistic,” and called for “increased conservatism” in the “design shear strength” to ensure the structural stability of the dam “in view of the scale and importance of the project.”

Chasing a Chimera: Implementing the Studies Recommended by the IPoE

For five years after the IPoE report was issued, the three countries engaged in endless, and often byzantine, negotiations on the completion of the recommended studies. During that period tens of meetings were held at every level of inter-governmental intercourse and in every imaginable format. Several summits of the Heads of State and Government were held, and countless trilateral meetings were convened between either the ministers of foreign affairs or the ministers of water affairs. Six-party talks, that included the foreign ministers and the water ministers, were also held. There were also two rounds of nine-party talks in which the directors of the intelligence agencies joined the foreign ministers and the water ministers. All the while, continuous expert-level discussions were held at the Tripartite National Committee that was overseeing the studies recommended by the IPoE, and an international consultant, the French firm BRLi, was hired to conduct these studies. A treaty, the 2015 Agreement on Declaration of Principles (DoP), was even concluded to guide this process. As I discuss in detail in Part III of this post, the DoP stipulated that the studies recommended by the IPoE shall be used to agree on the rules governing the filling and operation of the GERD and that the entire process should be completed within fifteen months.

Unfortunately, these efforts by presidents, prime ministers, ministers, hydrologists, engineers, and a French consultant, came to naught. Underlying the procedural wrangling and the substantive disagreements that torpedoed the efforts to conduct the IPoE studies was a single, all-important trip-wire. This was the “baseline scenario,” which is the reference case against which the impact of the dam would be measured. Throughout this process, Ethiopia refused to employ current downstream water uses as part of the baseline scenario. While I cannot speak on behalf of my Ethiopian colleagues, my presumption is that, for Ethiopia, the concern was that adopting a baseline scenario that included current uses, would amount to recognition of previous water-sharing agreements to which Ethiopia is not a party. The problem with that position is fourfold:

Politically, this was entirely unpalatable. Ethiopia was seeking to establish a hydrological tabula rasa by resetting reality and extinguishing current downstream uses.

Scientifically, it was simply nonsensical. Ethiopia was essentially proposing to measure the impact of the GERD without a measuring stick. How can the hydrological and environmental impacts of the GERD be determined without factoring-in variables such as the natural flow of the Blue Nile, the historical record and current levels of the fluvial discharge, the status and vulnerabilities of the riparian ecosystem, the state of groundwater aquifers connected to the Nile River, etc. Moreover, socio-economic impacts cannot be calculated without considering downstream withdrawals and uses, current projects and waterworks, water dependency ratios, population densities and demographic projections, hydropower production levels, etc.

Factually, never, during ten years of negotiations did Egypt bring up previous water-sharing agreements, nor did it seek to extract any recognition by Ethiopia of treaties to which it is not a party. Egypt always understood that would be a non-starter for Ethiopia. Instead, as demonstrated by the 2015 Declaration of Principles, which I discuss in Part III, Egypt sought to reach an agreement solely on the GERD on the basis of established principles of international law, without affecting or prejudicing existing or future riparian rights and obligations of the parties.

Legally, the two cardinal principles of the law of non-navigational uses of international watercourses, namely: the principle of equitable and reasonable utilization and the obligation not to cause significant harm, are unworkable without a baseline scenario predicated on existing uses. Quantifying equity, defining reasonableness, and preventing harm are simply impossible without considering existing uses. The fine-tuned balancing act that is required to identify the countervailing equities of the relevant parties is undoable unless the cost of the harm suffered by current uses is identified and compared to the potential payoff from planned projects. (I discuss the confounding relationship between the principle of equitable and reasonable utilization and the obligation not to cause significant harm, and the complexities of applying these rules: here)

The end result is that the studies recommended by the IPoE were never conducted. The construction of one of the largest hydropower dams in the world is almost complete without a comprehensive record of its potential impacts. Not only does this constitute a violation of international law by the dam owner and operator, it is also a breach of our collective responsibility to protect and preserve the sacred trust that is the Nile River and its riparian ecosystem for the benefit of future generations.

Enter the Hydrologists: The National Independent Scientific Research Group (NISRG)

As attempts to conduct the studies recommended by the IPoE ran aground, the NISRG was created in mid-2018 to formulate the technical modalities of the filling and operation of the GERD. This was a group of fifteen (nominally) independent hydrologists from the three countries who held five (out of an originally agreed nine) meetings. Although, ultimately, the NISRG failed to fulfill its mandate, it did prove to be the most productive of all the forums in which negotiations on the GERD were held. Four principles were agreed as the basic parameters of an agreement on the GERD. These were:

Principle One: To apply an adaptive and cooperative approach to the filling and operation of the GERD, which ensures close coordination between the GERD and the High Aswan Dam (HAD) in Egypt, and provides mechanisms for both dams to adapt to the changing hydrological conditions of the Blue Nile and share the burden of adjusting to future periods of drought.

Principle Two: To apply an annual minimum release. Once the water level at the GERD reaches a level that enables it to generate hydropower, Ethiopia will release a minimum amount of water to ensure that the HAD reservoir remains at sustainable levels.

Principle Three: Identifying “critical levels” in the reservoirs of the GERD and the HAD, which is a cutoff point in the water level in the reservoirs of both dams. The water below the critical level is designated as a “strategic reserve” that is used to mitigate the effects of droughts and prolonged droughts.

Principle Four: Establishing a joint coordination mechanism.

Based on these principles, Egypt presented a comprehensive proposal on the filling and operation of the GERD. Because this is not the place to describe the details of this proposal (if you’re interested, a video is available), suffice it to say that it was a fair and balanced approach that satisfied Ethiopia’s developmental objectives, while protecting Egypt against future droughts. Unfortunately, Ethiopia summarily rejected this Egyptian proposal. In fact, an utterly useless two-day ministerial meeting was held in Cairo on September 15-16, 2019 that failed to even adopt an agenda because Ethiopia refused to recognize that Egypt had presented a proposal. Two weeks later, the final meeting of NISRG was held in Khartoum. During that meeting, which at times witnessed heated exchanges between the delegations, Ethiopia presented a novel proposal that Egyptian hydrologists felt included numerous technical flaws. More alarmingly, that Ethiopian proposal revealed that Ethiopia was not prepared to agree on operational rules for the GERD. Instead, it was suggested that the operational rules should be renegotiated annually. That made the proposal untenable. As a result, it was concluded that the NISRG had reached a dead-end, and that a new process was needed to achieve a breakthrough.

That was when Egypt called upon the United States of America and the World Bank to participate in the negotiations. I tell the story of those negotiations in Part II of this post.","For almost a decade, Egypt, Ethiopia, and Sudan have been engaged in negotiations on the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD).

Helal, Assistant Professor of Law, Moritz College of Law and Affiliated Faculty, Mershon Center for International Security Studies, The Ohio State University, and is currently serving as a legal counsel with the Egyptian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Part I of this three-part post can be found here.]

In part II of this three-part post, I discuss the negotiations on the GERD that were held in recent months, which were attended by the United States and the World Bank, and I also provide a broad description of the agreement that was reached at the conclusion of this process.

The American End-Game:

By late-2019 it had become apparent to everyone in Egypt that trilateral talks on the GERD were fruitless. Every forum and format of negotiations had been exhausted, and during the final meeting of the NISRG, it was abundantly clear that the divergences between the three countries were growing. We were also running out of time. Ethiopia had announced that it would commence the filling of the GERD during the upcoming wet season of 2020, which is when heavy rains over the Abyssinian Highlands induce the storied annual flood of the Nile that Herodotus of Halicarnassus so beautifully (but hopelessly inaccurately) described in The Histories.

Therefore, on the basis of article 10 of the 2015 Agreement in Declaration of Principles (DoP), which allows the states party to settle disputes regarding the implementation of the DoP through, inter alia, mediation, Egypt invited the United States and the World Bank to join the negotiations in order to assist the three countries in reaching an agreement on the GERD.

The U.S. and the World Bank accepted Egypt’s invitation, which led to the launch of intensive negotiations that included twelve meetings that lasted from November 2019 until February 2020. During the five meetings that were held in the region, the U.S. was represented by an outstanding team from the Department of the Treasury, while the remaining meetings in Washington D.C. were chaired by U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin. The dates and locations of these meetings were as follows:

November 6, 2019: Meeting of the Ministers of Foreign Affairs and Water Affairs – Washington D.C. November 15-16, 2019: Meeting of the Ministers of Water Affairs – Addis Ababa December 2-3, 2019: Meeting of the Ministers of Water Affairs – Cairo December 9, 2019: Meeting of the Ministers of Foreign Affairs and Water Affairs – Washington D.C. December 21-22, 2019: Meeting of the Ministers of Water Affairs – Khartoum January 8-9, 2020: Meeting of the Ministers of Water Affairs – Addis Ababa January 13-15, 2020: Meeting of the Ministers of Foreign Affairs and Water Affairs – Washington D.C. January 22-23, 2020: Meeting of the Legal and Technical Working Groups – Khartoum January 28-31, 2020: Meeting of the Ministers of Foreign Affairs and Water Affairs – Washington D.C. February 3-10, 2020: Meeting of the Legal and Technical Working Groups – Washington D.C. February 12-13, 2020: Meeting of the Ministers of Foreign Affairs and Water Affairs – Washington D.C. February 27-28, 2020: Meeting of the Ministers of Foreign Affairs and Water Affairs – Washington D.C.

Because the twists and turns of this grueling rollercoaster of negotiations are far too many to describe in detail here, I will offer a few general reflections.

First and foremost, Egypt and Ethiopia had fundamentally diverging objectives. On one side, Egypt sought to reach a comprehensive treaty on the GERD. This treaty should establish clear substantive rights and obligations that protected the core interests of the three countries, while providing procedural guarantees to ensure the effective implementation of the agreement. Ethiopia, however, appeared unamenable to concluding an agreement that established unambiguous obligations. It pursued an amorphous, indeterminate, and toothless text that would operate at the twilight of legality. Indeed, my Ethiopian colleagues repeatedly dubbed the document that we were negotiating as an “understanding” not a treaty, and insisted that this document would outline “guidelines,” as opposed to stipulating rules.

Second, in terms of substantive breadth, Egypt called for an agreement that covered both the filling and operation of the GERD, and that included detailed drought mitigation measures to protect downstreamriparians. Not only is this consistent with article five of the 2015 DoP, which requires the three countries to agree on the “first filling” and “annual operation” of the dam, but it is commonsensical. A megaproject the size of the GERD ought to operate according to definite rules that provide sufficient clarity and precision to downstream riparians regarding the amount of water that will be released from the dam in all hydrological conditions.

Ethiopia, on the other hand, preferred agreeing on the filling of the GERD, while retaining unlimited freedom of action regarding the operation of the dam. Indeed, during the final meeting of the ministers of water affairs in Addis Ababa on January 8-9, 2020, Ethiopia submitted what can only be described as a non-proposal on the operation of the GERD. It stated the following: “At the end of the rainy season, the annual operation rule will be prepared and communicated.” Similarly, in the section on drought mitigation measures, it stated that “The percentage and release condition shall be determined through water affairs institutions of the three countries for the prevailing condition.” Practically, this means that downstream riparians would be locked in perpetual negotiations on ever-changing operational rules that would make them subject to the will and whim of an upstream riparian.

Third, Egypt exercised considerable flexibility throughout these negotiations. This was most evident when, upon Ethiopia’s insistence and America’s prodding, Egypt fundamentally altered its proposals for the filling and operation of the GERD. As discussed in Part I of this post, the NISRG had agreed that the filling and operation of the GERD would be adaptive and cooperative. For Egypt, which sought to reach an agreement that was consistent with international best-practices, this meant that the GERD and the High Aswan Dam (HAD) should operate as part of a coordinated “multi-reservoir operation.” Ethiopia, however, refused to integrate the GERD into a multi-reservoir operation and insisted that the discussion should focus exclusively on the GERD.

To accommodate this, the entire philosophy of the agreement was altered. Negotiations became focused on regulating the water release levels from the GERD during normal (i.e. average and above-average) hydrological conditions and determining the volume of water to be released from the GERD during periods of drought. After a technical agreement was reached on these matters, Ethiopia then did a volte-face. Although the agreement was, upon Ethiopia’s insistence, designed solely to govern the GERD, Ethiopia began arguing that drought mitigation measures should not be limited to the GERD, but should also be the responsibility of downstream reservoirs. In short, Ethiopia wanted to have its cake and eat it too. It sought to tailor-make each section of the agreement to fit its interests. Ethiopia would retain all the rights and privileges of the agreement, but wanted the burdens and obligations to be borne by its downstream co-riparians.

Fourth, and perhaps most importantly, for Egypt this is an agreement on the GERD. It is not a comprehensive regime for the utilization of the Blue Nile, nor is it a water apportionment arrangement. Ethiopia, however, intended to use this agreement to establish an unrestricted right to construct future waterworks upstream of the GERD. It has always been Egypt’s position that it is unquestionable that Ethiopia, as a co-riparian that enjoys an equality of right with other riparian states, has the right to enjoy the benefits of the Blue Nile. That right, however, must be governed by international law. Ethiopia, on the other hand, wanted to consecrate an unregulated right to the waters of the river; in essence, it sought to become the unchallenged princeps legibus solutus of the Nile.

Originally, the negotiations were scheduled to end by mid-January. It was agreed, however, to extend the talks for an additional month, and by mid-February it was decided that the U.S. would, on the basis of the technical and legal agreements reached by the parties, facilitate the drafting of the final text of the treaty. The final agreement, which was prepared with technical input from the World Bank, was shared with the parties on February 22, 2020. After reviewing the agreement, Egypt announced that it had accepted it and decided to initial it on February 28, 2020. Ethiopia, on the other hand, rejected the agreement.

This agreement is not an American text that was imposed on the parties. It is an agreement that is based entirely on the positons of the three countries. It is a fair and balanced formula that preserves their core interests. While I cannot divulge the content of the text, I am can share with Opinio Juris readers the broad contours of the agreement.

This agreement is predicated on a grand compromise: Ethiopia will be able to fill the dam as expeditiously as permitted by the hydrological conditions, and, in the long-term, it will be guaranteed the ability to generate hydropower from the GERD sustainably. On the other hand, Egypt and Sudan would be protected against the ravages of droughts or prolonged droughts that might coincide with the filling of the GERD or that might occur during the operation of the dam. This agreement achieved that through the following:

Stage-based filling: Egypt accepted a stage-based filling plan proposed by Ethiopia. The execution of each stage is dependent on the hydrological conditions of the Blue Nile, whereby in average years the filling would proceed according to schedule, while in above-average years it would be accelerated and in below-average years it would be decelerated.

Drought mitigation measures during the filling: The three countries agreed that Ethiopia would bring all the GERD hydropower turbines online within two years. The only limitation on this initial two-year filling period is that if an exceptionally severe drought were to occur (this type of drought has no more than a 2-3% chance of happening), the completion of this initial stage would be extended slightly. If a drought occurs after the initial two years, the agreement stipulates that the GERD will release, according to a detailed formula and over an extended period of years, a specified percentage of the water stored in the dam above 603m. To avoid boring readers with the engineering complexities and inane technicalities, suffice it to say that at a water level of 603m (which would be reached only in the worst droughts), the GERD would retain almost 25BCM, its turbines would be fully operational, and it would generate electricity at an efficiency rate of around 80% of its capacity.

Operational rule: This aspect of the agreement, which again was accepted by all three countries, is elegantly simple. Once the GERD water level reaches 625m, which Ethiopia calls the “optimal operating level,” the GERD will release the total volume of water entering the GERD reservoir.

Drought mitigation measures during operation: These provisions are similar to the drought mitigation measures during the filling. If a drought occurs during the operation, the GERD is required to release the water stored above 603m according to a detailed formula and over an extended period of years.

Dispute resolution and coordination mechanism: The agreement includes a hybrid dispute resolution mechanism that combines negotiation-based solutions to disputes with the option to refer the matter to binding arbitration (needless to say, Ethiopia rejects binding arbitration). The agreement also includes a coordination mechanism that allows for streamlined data exchange and regular meetings to ensure the implementation of the agreement.

Any compromise text is naturally imperfect. While it preserves the core interests of the parties, it also balances the payoffs and distributes the costs equitably. It gives each of the parties some wins that justify their losses and offers a sufficiently balanced formula to ensure that the agreement is sustainable. The agreement prepared by the U.S. in coordination with the World Bank does just that. Ethiopia will generate all the electricity it needs and Egypt will be protected against the vagaries of the changing hydrological conditions of the Blue Nile.

Moreover, this agreement does not mortgage the future. A stream of articles (here, here, here) has been published by the Ethiopian officials and commentators that claim that their rejection of the agreement is, partially, because it is a water-sharing agreement, and that it seeks to impose so-called colonial agreements on Ethiopia. This is patently untrue. The agreement is designed to govern the filling and operation of the GERD, without prejudicing the riparian rights, obligations, and equities of the parties. It is not a water allocation agreement (in fact, it explicitly says so), nor does it make any explicit reference to, or establish any implicit connection with, preexisting agreements. While it might be politically expedient, especially in an election year, to claim that the agreement drafted by the U.S. and World Bank seeks to entangle Ethiopia in a water-allocation arrangement, the short-term political payoff from this tactic does not, in my view, even begin to outweigh the huge benefits that will accrue to the three countries from this agreement.

The ball is now in Ethiopia’s court. A fair and balanced treaty is on the table. What we need is the kind of political will and visionary leadership that can capitalize on this opportunity and chart a new course for the entire region.","The American End-Game:By late-2019 it had become apparent to everyone in Egypt that trilateral talks on the GERD were fruitless.

In the third and final part of this blogpost, I will discuss the rules of international law that govern the GERD. These are the rules that apply between the three riparian states (Egypt, Ethiopia, and Sudan) both generally regarding their utilization of the Nile River and specifically in relation to the GERD.

The Law of the Dam:

Like any question or controversy in international law, the GERD is governed by a combination of lex specialis and lex generalis. The most important of the former is the Agreement on Declaration of Principles (DoP), which was concluded by the three countries on March 23, 2015. In addition, there are a series of declarations, documents, joint and unilateral statements that either generate additional legal obligations or clarify the scope and content of established obligations that bind the parties. The applicable lex generalis includes rules emanating from both conventional and customary international law. Preexisting bilateral treaties between Egypt and Ethiopia and between Egypt and Sudan provide broad background rules that continue to govern their riparian relations, while the customary rules of, inter alia, international environmental law, international human rights law, and of course, the law of the non-navigational uses of international water courses continue to be relevant and applicable.

Obviously, this is not the place to delve into the jurisprudential debate over the interaction between lex specialis and lex generalis (if, like myself, this is a topic that interests you, I recommend reading this piece, which I never tire of rereading). However, suffice it to say that lex specialis and lex generalis are often locked in an organic relationship of symbiotic interdependence. While lex specialis provide the primarily applicable rules, lex generalis will often step-in to fill gaps unaddressed by the former. Lex generalis alsoconstitute the universe of background rules that give lex specialis normative direction and assist in applying and interpreting these context-specific rules. As such, when considering the law of the GERD, we must examine the applicable lex specialis in light of the established lex generalis and apply the former without jettisoning the latter.

The 2015 Agreement on Declaration of Principles (DoP):

The DoP (available here) consists of ten provisions. It identifies that the “purpose of GERD is for power generation,” and affirms the commitment of all three countries to the two cardinal principles of the law of the non-navigational uses of international watercourses: the principle of equitable and reasonable utilization and the obligation not to cause significant harm. It reaffirms broad, almost hortatory, principles, such as sovereign equality, territorial integrity, and confidence building, and underscores the duty to cooperate in a manner that is mutually beneficial. It also states that Ethiopia shall “continue the full implementation of the dam safety recommendations” of the IPoE (see Part I of this post).

The core provision of the DoP, indeed, its backbone, is article five. It commits the three countries to “implement the recommendations of the International Panel of Experts (IPoE), respect the final outcomes of the Tripartite National Committee (TNC) Final Report on the joint studies recommended by the IPOE Final Report throughout the different stages of the project.” It also stipulates that “the three countries, in the spirit of cooperation, will utilize the final outcomes of the joint studies, to be conducted as per the recommendations of the IPoE Report and agreed upon by the TNC, to:

a. Agree on guidelines and rules on the first filling of GERD which shall cover all different scenarios, in parallel with the construction of GERD.

b. Agree on guidelines and rules for the annual operation of GERD, which the owner of the dam may adjust from time to time.

c. Inform the downstream countries on any unforeseen or urgent circumstances requiring adjustments in the operation of GERD.

– To sustain cooperation and coordination on the annual operation of GERD with downstream reservoirs, the three countries, through the line ministries responsible for water, shall set up an appropriate coordination mechanism among them.

– The timeline for conducting the above-mentioned process shall be 15 months from the inception of the two studies recommended by the IPoE”

In the interest of clarity, the obligations generated by article five, which reflect the object and purpose of the DoP, can be summarized into the following:

First: Reaffirming the obligation to implement the studies recommended by the IPoE.

Second: Utilizing the IPoE studies in the negotiations on the filling and operation of the GERD.

Third: Agreeing on “guidelines and rules” to govern the first filling and annual operation of the GERD.

Fourth: Allowing for the construction of the GERD while negotiations on the “guidelines and rules” governing the filling and operation of the GERD are being conducted.

Fifth: Setting a fifteen-month timeline for the entire process.

In terms of its scope and impact on the lex generalis governing the utilization of the Nile River, the DoP is fairly limited. Some writers have argued that the DoP has displaced all previous agreements relating to the use of the Nile waters. For instance, Salman M. A. Salman, an authority in the field, wrote (here p. 69-70) that the DoP marked the emergence of a “new legal order … replacing for all practical and legal purposes, the 1902 Treaty and the 1959 Nile Waters Agreement.”

In my view, this is incorrect. The DoP is an exceptionally narrow treaty. It applies to a single project that is being undertaken by a single riparian state on a single tributary of the Nile River. It is of no relevance to the White Nile or to either the Atbara or Sobat Rivers. It is not a water apportionment agreement nor does it regulate other water abstractions by Ethiopia, Sudan and Egypt. It is merely an interim agreement that obliges the three states to reach an agreement on the filling and operation of the GERD on the basis of the principle of equitable and reasonable utilization and the obligation not to cause significant harm and in light of the IPoE Report and the content of the studies that it recommended.

Therefore, if and when a comprehensive agreement on the filling and operation of the GERD enters into force, the DoP will have exhausted its object and purpose and will be relegated to the status of a legal artifact. As such, older and broader bilateral treaties that have been concluded between the three countries to regulate their use of the Nile waters will continue to apply. For instance, the 1993 Framework for General Cooperation between Egypt and Ethiopia and the 1959 Nile Waters Agreement between Egypt and Sudan, will remain valid and binding in the bilateral relations between the three countries. If an agreement on the filling and operation of the GERD is reached, those older lex generalis agreements will apply insofar as they are not displaced by an agreement on the filling and operation of the GERD, while if we do not reach an agreement on the GERD, those lex generalis will remain in force and applicable between the three countries inter se.

To Fill or Not to Fill: The Specter of Unilateralism

Ethiopia has announced that it will commence the filling of the GERD sometime during the summer of 2020. Ethiopia has asserted that it is entitled to begin the filling of the dam without an agreement with its downstream co-riparians, and has argued that the DoP either permits or at least does not prohibit the unilateral filling of the GERD. It is also argued, as an Ethiopian scholar contended (here), that the “DoP states only that the three countries will use studies to agree on the first filling and annual operation of the dam. That is why they have been negotiating since 2015. But what if they fail to agree on the studies? The DoP is silent and did not address this scenario. In other words, nothing in the DoP prohibits Ethiopia from filling and testing the GERD.”

I beg to differ.

First:To justify the unilateral filling of the GERD by arguing that the DoP does not explicitly prohibit such an act is, to quote ICJ President Dame Rosalyn Higgins, “formalism of an un-evenhanded sort.” Such an argument defeats the purpose of the DoP and empties its objective of all meaning.

The DoP includes two categories of obligations: an obligation of means and an obligation of result. The latter is the obligation to agree on “guidelines and rules” to govern the filling and operation of the GERD, while the former – the obligation of means – is to utilize the studies recommended by the IPoE during the negotiations on the “guidelines and rules” of the filling and operation of the GERD. While inter-related, these two obligations are ultimately separate and distinct. They are neither sequential nor mutually exclusive. The process of completing the IPoE studies is a distinct endeavor from the process of agreeing on the “guidelines and rules” governing the filling and operation of the GERD. The latter can, and has indeed, proceeded without the former.

The practice of the three countries confirms this assertion. On May 15, 2018, the three countries adopted a document titled the “Outcome of the Second Nine-Party Meeting of the Ministers of Foreign Affairs, Water, and Heads of Intelligence of Egypt, Ethiopia, and the Sudan.” This document included instructions to the French firm BRLi, which was hired to conduct the studies recommended by the IPoE. In parallel, this document established the NISRG, which as discussed in Part I of this post, was tasked with formulating the rules of the filling and operating of the dam. No mention was made of the IPoE studies in the mandate of the NISRG. In short, the two processes, were kept entirely separate.

Second: Having established that agreeing on the “guidelines and rules” of the filling and operation of the GERD is not dependent on completing the IPoE studies, it immediately becomes apparent that the DoP requires the parties to reach an agreement on the filling and operation of the GERD and that unilaterally filling the GERD is impermissible.

A close reading of paragraphs (a) and (b) of article five is vital in this regard. These two provisions establish distinct obligations to agree on “guidelines and rules” for both the “first filling” and “annual operation” of the GERD. These obligations are entirely separate from the obligation of means to complete and utilize the IPoE studies that is included in the chapeaux of paragraphs (a) and (b). As such, the DoP made the “first filling” and the “annual operation” of the GERD dependent on reaching an agreement between the parties on the “guidelines and rules” governing those two processes.

An especially important feature of the DoP confirms this conclusion: Paragraph (a) of article five identifies the only activity that may proceed unilaterally without the IPoE studies and regardless of the status of the negotiations on the “guidelines and rules” of the filling and operation. That activity is the construction of the GERD. As per article five, Ethiopia is permitted to construct the GERD in parallel with the completion the IPoE studies and while the three countries are negotiating the “guidelines and rules” of the filling and operation of the dam. By explicitly stipulating that the construction of the GERD may proceed unilaterally, but, conversely, subjecting the “first filling” and “annual operation” of the dam to an agreement to be concluded between the parties, the DoP has made the commencement of the filling conditional on reaching an agreement on the “guidelines and rules” of the filling and operation. Filling the dam in the absence of such an agreement would constitute a material breach of the DoP.

Fourth (and finally) the 1997 judgment of the ICJ in the Gabčíkovo–Nagymaros case is apposite here. In that case, Czechoslovakia (and then Slovakia) unilaterally implemented a project (dubbed Variant C) that diverted the waters of the Danube. The Court found that this violated the 1977 agreement with Hungary which made the Gabčíkovo–Nagymaros project a “single and indivisible operational system.” While the GERD is neither jointly owned nor jointly operated, the situation is analogous to the Gabčíkovo–Nagymaros case. In that case, the ICJ noted that “[i]t is true that Hungary, in concluding the 1977 Treaty, had agreed to the damming of the Danube and the diversion of its waters into the bypass canal. But it was only in the context of a joint operation and a sharing of its benefits that Hungary had given its consent.” Like Hungary, Egypt signed the DoP only in the context that the filling and operation of the GERD will be undertaken according to agreed rules. And conversely, like Czechoslovakia (and Slovakia), by signing the DoP, Ethiopia limited its freedom of action and assumed an obligation to fill and operate the GERD according to agreed rules. Filling the GERD unilaterally would place Ethiopia in a positon that is similar to Czechoslovakia, which the Court noted had violated international law by “unilaterally assuming control of a shared resource, and thereby depriving Hungary of its right to an equitable and reasonable share of the natural resources of the Danube.”

The only case where Ethiopia could perhaps argue that it is permitted to fill the GERD unilaterally is if Egypt had refused to engage in negotiations on the “guidelines and rules” of the filling and operation, or if it acted in bad faith and sought to derail these negotiations to prevent Ethiopia from filling the dam. The reality, as I describe in Parts I and II of this post, is the opposite. Not only has Egypt tirelessly engaged in these negotiations, it even accepted and initialed an agreement on the filling and operation of the GERD that was prepared by impartial mediators. Ethiopia, however, derailed the process of completing the IPoE studies, rejected the agreement prepared by impartial parties, and is preparing to unilaterally commence the filling.","While lex specialis provide the primarily applicable rules, lex generalis will often step-in to fill gaps unaddressed by the former.
Agree on guidelines and rules for the annual operation of GERD, which the owner of the dam may adjust from time to time.
Second: Utilizing the IPoE studies in the negotiations on the filling and operation of the GERD.
No mention was made of the IPoE studies in the mandate of the NISRG.
These obligations are entirely separate from the obligation of means to complete and utilize the IPoE studies that is included in the chapeaux of paragraphs (a) and (b).",2020-05-04 00:00:00,[],"['dop', 'ipoe', 'rules', 'far', 'ethiopian', 'grand', 'guidelines', 'lex', 'iii', 'gerd', 'negotiations', 'filling', 'dam', 'studies', 'renaissance', 'agreement', 'account', 'close', 'operation']"

CAIRO - 2 March 2018: Water efficiency is considered one of the Egyptian National Security issues, the Nile River is the country’s most important water source.The ancient Egypt culture was built on the sides of the river, the Nile provides Egypt with 95 percent of its water, in 1902, 1906, 1929 and 1959, Cairo signed agreements with the Nile Basin countries that guaranteed 55 billion cubic meters of Nile water per year for Egypt.Egypt suffers from a water deficit of 30 billion cubic meters; it annually needs at least 90 billion cubic meters of water to cover 90 million citizens’ needs. However, it currently has only 60 billion cubic meters, of which 55.5 billion cubic meters come from the Nile and just under five billion cubic meters come from non-renewable subterranean water in the deserts.Further decrease in Egypt's water resources is expected amid the construction of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), which could have a negative impact on Egypt’s Nile water share.Despite the latest negotiations between Ethiopia, Egypt and Sudan to resolve the technical issues of the dam, Egypt is keen to look for new sources of water and to rationalize its usage to overcome any water scarcity problems in the future.Agriculture in Egypt depends heavily on the Nile River, and it consumes 84 percent of Egypt’s water resources; therefore, the State is working on keeping its water security as much as it can through taking some procedures that may help ration water.The government has taken procedures aiming to ration water consumption through preventing the cultivation of crops that need large amounts of water.Minister of Irrigation and Water Resources Mohamed Abdel Atti decided to reduce the rice agriculture area in Egypt from 1,700,000 feddans to 724,200 feddans (1 feddan = 1.038 acres); According to the ministry this decline will save three billion cubic meters of water. At the same time the ministry is working on launching campaigns to raise farmers’ awareness to reduce water usage.On the other hand, some experts expect that reducing the rice cultivated areas will lead to a decrease in production, decrease the quantities offered in the markets and lead to higher prices and a trend towards imports to cover the needs of the local market to insure food security.The Ministry of Agriculture has identified 53 varieties of strategic water-saving crops that are adapted to the different environment and climate conditions, focusing on breeding during the coming period, which included seven varieties of rice.Egypt is preparing a LE 900 billion national plan for water management over the next 20 years in participation with nine ministers to develop solutions for water scarcity, according to Abdel Atti on Sunday.During the “Egypt Can…With the Sons of the Nile” conference held on Sunday in Luxor and attended by 23 Egyptian international scientists, Abdel Atti remarked that the country allocates LE 70 billion out of LE 900 billion in investments for the crisis of water shortage.The groundwater in the Nile Valley and Delta is about 6.5 billion cubic meters, rain water on North coast is 1.3 billion cubic meters.Cairo, Giza and Qalyubia are considered the highest water consuming governorates because of their high populations.The amount of clean water produced throughout the country in 2016 was 9,297 million cubic meters. The highest rate during the last eight years was in 2012/2013 when it reached 9,727 million cubic meters.","Will reducing cultivated rice areas rationalize water?

In 2014, around 91 percent of the Egyptian population received water directly into their residence.[1] However, while access to water is almost universal and reliable in urban areas, a significant number of households are still not connected with the water system in rural areas and in urban slums.[2] 7.3 million people are deprived of access to safe water, among which 5.8 million live in rural areas and 1.5 million in urban areas. In rural areas, around 12 percent of the population live in dwellings not connected to the water system while, in urban areas, it’s 4 percent which do not have water connection. They are usually located in urban slums and poor settlements.[1] In urban slum areas, only around 77 percent of households have piped water coming into their homes and in many cases the connection is illegal.

In Egypt, 8.4 million people are deprived of access to improved sanitation, mostly in rural areas. Overall, 10 percent of the Egyptian population did not benefit from access to improved sanitation, with marked geographical and socio-economic disparities in 2014.[1] In rural areas, on average, the share of population without access to adequate sanitation was around 15 percent in 2014, compared with around 1 percent among urban dwellers.1 96 percent of all Egyptian households have place for washing hands, with no substantial difference between urban and rural households. However, in rural areas, around 13 percent of those households don’t use soap or other detergent.[1]

Regarding water, sanitation and hygiene in schools, most updated statistics report access to piped water coverage at 98 percent in urban areas and at 84 percent in rural areas.

Lack of access to safe water and proper sanitation facilities as well as poor hygiene contribute to the spreading of diseases, which significantly and negatively impact on children’s health and nutrition. In Egypt, diarrhea is the second leading cause of death among under-5 children.

169,https://www.ecomena.org/egypt-water/,Water Crisis in Egypt,"Egypt has been suffering from severe water scarcity in recent years. Uneven water distribution, misuse of water resources and inefficient irrigation techniques are some of the major factors playing havoc with water security in the country. Egypt has only 20 cubic meters per person of internal renewable freshwater resources, and as a result the country relies heavily on the Nile River for its main source of water. The River Nile is the backbone of Egypt’s industrial and agricultural sector and is the primary source of drinking water for the population.

Rising populations and rapid economic development in the countries of the Nile Basin, pollution and environmental degradation are decreasing water availability in the country. Egypt is facing an annual water deficit of around 7 billion cubic metres. Infact, United Nations is already warning that Egypt could run out of water by the year 2025. According to My Custom Essay experts you can see the information provided below that could be essential for students who write academic papers.

Let us have a close look at major factors affecting Egypt’s water security:

Population Explosion

Egypt’s population is mushrooming at an alarming rate and has increased by 41 percent since the early 1990s. Recent reports by the government suggest that around 4,700 newborns are added to the population every week, and future projections say that the population will grow from its current total of 92 million to 110 million by the year 2025.

The rapid population increase multiplies the stress on Egypt’s water supply due to more water requirements for domestic consumption and increased use of irrigation water to meet higher food demands.

Inefficient Irrigation

Egypt receives less than 80 mm of rainfall a year, and only 6 percent of the country is arable and agricultural land, with the rest being desert. This leads to excessive watering and the use of wasteful irrigation techniques such as flood irrigation [an outdated method of irrigation where gallons of water are pumped over the crops].

Nowadays, Egypt’s irrigation network draws almost entirely from the Aswan High Dam, which regulates more than 18,000 miles of canals and sub-canals that push out into the country’s farmlands adjacent to the river. This system is highly inefficient, losing as much as 3 billion cubic meters of Nile water per year through evaporation and could be detrimental by not only intensifying water and water stress but also creating unemployment.

A further decrease in water supply would lead to a decline in arable land available for agriculture, and with agriculture being the biggest employer of youth in Egypt, water scarcity could lead to increased unemployment levels.

Pollution

The pollution of river Nile is an issue that has been regularly underestimated. With so many people relying on the Nile for drinking, agricultural, and municipal use, the quality of that water should be of pivotal importance. The reality is that water of Nile is being polluted by municipal waste and industrial waste, with many recorded incidents of leakage of wastewater, the dumping of dead animal carcasses, and the release of chemical and hazardous industrial waste into the river.

Industrial waste has led to the presence of metals in the water which pose a significant risk not only on human health, but also on animal health and agricultural production. Fish die in large numbers from poisoning because of the high levels of ammonia and lead. Agricultural production quality and quantity has been affected by using untreated water for irrigation as the bacteria and the metals in the water affect the growth of the plant produce, especially in the Nile Delta where pollution is highest.

Sewage water from slums and many other areas in Cairo is discharged into the river untreated due to lack of water treatment plants. Agricultural runoffs frequently contain pollutants from pesticides and herbicides, which have negative effects on the river and the people using it. All of these factors combine together to make Nile a polluted river which may spell doom for the generations to come.

Regional Upheavals

Egypt controls majority of the water resource extracted from the Nile River due to colonial-era treaty, which guaranteed Egypt 90 percent share of the Nile, and prevented their neighbors from extracting even a single drop from the Nile without permission. However, in recent years countries along the Nile such as Ethiopia are taking advantage are gaining more control over the rights for the Nile.

A big challenge is tackling the issue of Ethiopia building a dam and hydroelectric plant upstream that may cut into Egypt’s share of the Nile. For some time a major concern for Egypt was Ethiopia’s construction of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) in the Blue Nile watershed, which is a main source of water for the Nile River. Construction of the Renaissance Dam started in December 2010, and has the capacity to store 74 to 79 billion cubic meters of water and generate 6,000 megawatts of electricity for Ethiopia a year.

This creates major concern for Egypt, who is worried that this damn would decrease the amount of water it receives (55.5 billion cubic meters) from the Nile River. Egypt is concerned that during dry months, not enough water will be released from the GERD thus decreasing the water received downstream. This will greatly hinder Egypt’s attempts to alleviate the water shortages during those months.

Conclusions

Water availability issues in Egypt are rapidly assuming alarming proportions. By the year 2020, Egypt will be consuming 20 percent more water than it has. With its loosening grip on the Nile, water scarcity could endanger the country’s stability and regional dominance. It is imperative on the Egyptian government and the entire population of to act swiftly and decisively to mitigate water scarcity, implement water conservation techniques and control water pollution develop plans that would install more efficient irrigation techniques.

With climate conditions expected to get drier and heat waves expected to become more frequent in the MENA region, Egypt cannot afford to neglect the importance of water conservation anymore and must act immediately to augment its natural water reserves. It will be a good idea to use eco friendly cotton bags next time you go shopping.

Overview

Since 1978, USAID has invested more than $3.5 billion to bring potable water and sanitation services to over 25 million Egyptians. USAID constructed and rehabilitated wastewater systems in Cairo, Alexandria, and the three Suez Canal cities. Later, USAID helped the Government of Egypt (GOE) establish the Holding Company for Water and Wastewater, a water regulator and a national umbrella organization to standardize and govern local water utility companies. USAID worked with the GOE to strengthen the policy, legal, and regulatory framework for water distribution and access. USAID supported the GOE in restructuring tariffs, helping water companies come closer to achieving cost recovery for operations and maintenance – in other words, sustainability and self-sufficiency.

With reforms in place, USAID continues to support GOE plans to ensure self-sufficient water subsidiaries and increase access to clean water and sanitation services in underserved rural areas where citizens suffer from unreliable and sometimes low-quality potable water and few wastewater connections. Water pollution in canals and drains represents the greatest threat to public health in rural areas where wastewater is discharged without treatment and carries the risk of waterborne diseases. Moreover, population growth has led to an expansion of settlements near the heavily polluted, unsanitary waterways, putting residents further at risk. Current USAID efforts are improving access to services for more than one million rural residents, which is essential to their health and livelihoods.

Activities

EGYPT UTILITIES MANAGEMENT: USAID partners with Egypt’s national Holding Company for Water and Wastewater and its subsidiaries to improve access to water and sanitation in underserved communities of rural Upper Egypt by providing access to safe water, constructing wastewater facilities for basic sanitation, and supporting water and sanitation policy and governance.

172,http://www.emro.who.int/egy/programmes/neglected-tropical-diseases.html,Vector-borne diseases,"Vector-borne diseases are illnesses caused by pathogens and parasites in human populations and account for more than 17% of all infectious diseases.

Egypt is affected by at least seven vector-borne diseases of public health concern, including lymphatic filariasis, malaria, schistosomiasis and Rift Valley fever. However, many of these diseases are preventable through evidence-based protective measures.

WHO has worked with the MoHP to conduct a vector control needs analysis and provided assistance in the development of a plan of action to build national capacity in the areas of integrated vector management, vector mapping and resistance monitoring, as well as sound management of public health pesticides. WHO supports the MoHP in the scale up of vector mapping and increased surveillance of vector risk in key areas.

Schistosomiasis

Once highly endemic and affecting large numbers, schistosomiasis is now low-endemic throughout the country.

WHO works with the MoHP and the National Schistosomiasis Control Programme (NSCP) to control morbidity and reduce prevalence of infection in all affected areas through successful implementation of a strategy based on repeated, regular treatment with anti-helminthics of school-age children, the highest risk group. Treatment is provided through the primary school health system and other ongoing health or education programmes.

Following the progress made in reducing the burden of schistosomiasis, in February 2014 WHO supported the MoHP in the development of the eight year Plan of Action on the elimination of schistosomiasis in Egypt.

In order to sustain low endemicity and eventually achieve elimination, new strategies based on sensitive surveillance tools need to be adopted to prevent resurgence and recrudescence. School-based deworming campaigns need to be continued in uncovered areas, particularly in Upper Egypt.

Schistosomiasis

Malaria

Since 1998, no indigenous malaria cases have been reported by the malaria control programme anywhere in the country. However, imported cases are regularly reported, mainly from subSaharan Africa, and remain a significant challenge. In 2014 a malaria outbreak was discovered in Aswan.

WHO works with the MoHP to quickly respond to cases of malaria. Assistance is given to strengthen the malaria surveillance and information system, reinforce malaria notification and improve the capacity of health staff in the public and private sectors to diagnose and treat malaria. WHO is supporting the MoHP to scale up vector mapping and enhance surveillance of malaria vector risk in hot spot areas.

Malaria

Regional programme for malaria control and elimination

Lymphatic filariasis

Lymphatic filariasis has been eliminated from most areas of Egypt. However, sustained mass drug administration activities and post-mass drug administration surveillance are still required. The mapping of chronic infected villages has been completed and they are being targeted by programme activities.

WHO works with the MoHP building the capacity to carry out epidemiological surveillance, which is essential for the monitoring and evaluation of disease occurrence and impact of mass drug administration activities. Further effort needs to be placed on alleviating the suffering of chronic lymphatic filariasis patients. With increased political commitment and sustained programme efforts the elimination goal can be achieved.

Mixed etiology was also responsible for several out-

breaks; for example, (1%) of the reported outbreaks

involved mixed agents. Non- Legionella bacteria and para-

sites were identiﬁed in four mixed-agent outbreaks:

C. jejuni , Campylobacter lari , Cryptosporidium spp. and

Helicobacter canadensis ;S almonella spp. and G. lamblia ;

S. sonnei , Cryptosporidium spp., G. lamblia and Clostridium

difﬁcile; and C. jejuni , Entamoeba spp. and G. lamblia . Two

outbreaks involved bacteria and norovirus. Norovirus gen-

ogroups I and II and C. jejuni were identiﬁed in one out-

break. Norovirus genogroup I, Campylobacter spp., and

Salmonella spp. were identiﬁed in the other. The remaining

mixed-agent outbreak involved C. jejuni , norovirus, and

G. lamblia. Mixed-agent outbreaks were most reported dur-

ing 2001–2008 [34] .

Investigators identiﬁed 720 deﬁciencies during 1971–2008.

A single water system deﬁciency or source of contamination

was found in 685 outbreaks. Two deﬁciencies were identiﬁed

in 16 outbreaks and three deﬁciencies were identiﬁed in one

outbreak. In almost all (94%) of the multiple-deﬁciency out-

breaks, investigators found contamination from distribution

system mains, storage facilities or premise plumbing (e.g.

cross-connections or backﬂow) in addition to contamination

from untreated or inadequately treated water. In 30 outbreaks,

engineering and environmental information was inadequate to

identify a deﬁciency [37] .

Metal contaminants in drinking water still represent a rele-

vant health issue in several areas of the world. In particular,

the presence of high arsenic in groundwater, usually linked

to the geological characteristics of the territory, is a challeng-

ing task for risk managers, especially when alternative sources

of water for human consumption are not available.

The concentrations of arsenic in nearly all samples taken

from source water exceeded the maximum permitted concen-

tration for drinking water quality guidelines. There is a strong

body of evidence linking arsenic intake with a variety of health

problems. Chronic effects on humans may be caused by pro-

longed consumption of water with even very low concentra-

tions [38] . This poses a threat to human health because of

the high carcinogenic effect of arsenic. Water-borne arsenic

is a major cause of morbidity and it is the only contaminant

that has been shown to cause human cancers following expo-

sure through drinking water. Moreover, arsenic is responsible

for many unfavorable health effects including hyperkeratosis

and peripheral vascular disease [39] .

In our study, cadmium levels in almost all samples taken

from source water exceeded the maximum permitted concen-

tration for drinking water. Chronic cadmium exposure may

cause kidney damage, usually a tubular dysfunction associated

with reduction of glomerular ﬁltration and stone formation.

Besides, an association between cadmium exposure and

chronic renal failure (end stage renal disease) has been shown

[40] .

Similarly, lead concentrations in most water sources sam-

ples were found to be higher than the permitted maximum con-

taminant levels in drinking water quality guidelines. Children

exposed to high lead concentrations for long periods may have

behavioral disturbances along with learning, memorization,

and concentration difﬁculties. Lead-induced inhibition of

hemoglobin synthesis may lead to anemia. In addition, evi-

dence for renal damage has been shown in some studies [41] .

Likewise, mercury levels in nearly all samples taken from

source water exceeded the maximum permitted concentration

for drinking water. Chronic exposure to mercury in drinking

water may be associated with neurological and psychological

symptoms, such as tremor, personality changes, restlessness,

anxiety, sleep disturbance, and depression. Renal, visual, and

auditory adverse effects may occur as well [42] .

Heavy metals concentrations in all samples taken from

plant and tap water were less than the maximum contaminant

levels (MCL) despite the presence of these metals in most sam-

ples from source water at levels higher than MCL. This would

indicate the efﬁciency of water treatment and the integrity of

water pipe systems at the studied localities.

The results for metal levels in source water samples showed

variability regarding both sampling location and sampling sea-

son. The studied metals in source water samples from different

locations were above the WHO standard limits except from

Tanta, where many samples for different metals were below

the maximum contaminant level. Some samples showed lead

and/or mercury levels below the standard limits in Mahalla

Al-Kobra and Kafr Al-Zayat regions. Geographic locations

may affect the quality of water, depending on the mineral com-

positions of the soil and the presence of pollutants and heavy

metals. Also, differences in human activities including indus-

trial and agricultural activities vary according to location

and season.

The ﬁndings reported here, must be an alert to health agen-

cies concerned with safe water supply in Egypt because chronic

exposure to these heavy metals has been associated with a

range of disorders from mild to the most severe. Another con-

cern is that people living in these locations consume ﬁsh or

other products collected from rivers, and at the present time

there is no information about the level of contamination in edi-

ble tissues of these products.

The current study shows a signiﬁcant degree of contamina-

tion in water sources from the studied areas in Gharbiya gov-

ernorate. This level of contamination is not constant in all

locations and might be associated with season of the year

and anthropogenic activities. The high metal concentrations

measured in this study raise concern about the health of com-

munities settled in the studied area. It is therefore warranted

that drinking water should be regularly monitored for heavy

metals in order to prevent excessive buildup of these heavy

metals in the human food chain.

To be able to set priorities, good quality data on the levels of

contaminants in water and related morbidity and mortality are

needed, although the interpretation may be complicated by the

multi-factorial nature of many diseases. Well-designed epidemi-

ological studies are also needed for some of the contaminants

such as chlorination by-products, ﬂuoride and uranium where

information on exposure–response relationships is missing or

of insufﬁcient quality. In other cases, toxicological studies are

also required to help to determine the potential risk.

Conclusions

Water sanitation in the middle region of the Nile Delta is far

from ideal. Biological agents especially the neglected protozoal

infections such as giardiasis and cryptosporidiosis constitute a

Then supplies in the canal linking his seven acres to the river dwindled as other farmers drew more water, and he had to abandon half the plot.

His smallholding is one of the victims of a creeping water crisis, exacerbated by Egypt’s growing population and the impacts of climate change.

Egypt fears things could get even worse as Ethiopia starts filling the reservoir behind a giant dam upriver.

On Wednesday, the United States was hosting talks between the countries and their fellow Nile-user Sudan to try to restart stalled talks over the hydropower project.

U.S. President Donald Trump said he met with officials from Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan to discuss the issues involved.

“The meeting went well and discussions will continue during the day!” Trump said in a Twitter post.

But even if Washington succeeds where years of trilateral negotiations have failed, Egypt will still have broader water problems that have left it struggling to sustain food production.

“There is very little Nile water,” said Abd-Rabo, standing next to the plot where he grows wheat and fodder in Fayoum, about 100 km (60 miles) south of the capital, Cairo.

“In winter, sometimes there’s a bit more, but mainly because the land doesn’t need a lot of water in the winter. But in the summer, we don’t get any.”

Egyptian officials say they currently have around 570 cubic meters (150,000 gallons) of water per person per year - hydrologists consider a country to be facing water scarcity if supplies drop below 1,000 cubic meters per person annually.

Mud and soil

Egypt’s figure is expected to drop to 500 cubic meters by 2025. That is without taking into account the impact of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, which Egypt says will lower water levels further, though Ethiopia says it has taken the needs of Egypt and Sudan into account.

The stakes are high. Talk of physical conflict between the countries along the Nile has receded, but Egypt sees the dam as an existential threat that could decimate farming and damage power supplies.

More than 80% of its water is used for agriculture, but scarcity means Cairo already imports about half its food and is the world’s largest wheat importer.

The government is urging farmers to use more efficient irrigation and plant seeds with shorter life spans that require less water. It is also trying to recycle more water.

But the water management and irrigation schemes have not reached everyone.

“We are still using old irrigation techniques, which use mud and soil, and waste water,” said Aref Mohamed, a farmer near the southern city of Luxor.

Fines to stop farmers planting water-intensive rice in the northern Nile Delta are not being as strictly enforced as last year, locals say. The area under rice cultivation has shot up to 1.75 million acres (0.7 million hectare) from about 800,000 acres over the same period, according to irrigation ministry estimates.

Temperatures

Climate change presents another risk. With temperatures rising, Egypt could lose 30% of its food production in southern areas by 2040, according to the U.N. World Food Programme.

Heatwaves have already reduced crop productivity and in Fayoum, residents say temperatures have been rising for years, forcing farmers to use more water for less land.

“We have not got any produce from this land over the past three years because of the temperature levels,” said another farmer in Fayoum, asking not to be named. “Now, if I have two feddans (2.1 acres), I will plant one and leave the other one.”

The effect of climate change in upstream nations is uncertain.

“It is unclear whether there will be an increase or decrease of rainfall in countries of (the Nile) source,” said Tahani Mostafa Sileet of Egypt’s water resources and irrigation ministry. “As such, we don’t know whether to adjust our politics based on an increase or a decrease of resources.”

But any alteration to Nile flows could make “huge difference”, said Randa Aboul Hosn of the UN development agency UNDP. Every “2% drop of water affects one million people,” she said.","Image: REUTERS/Amr Abdallah DalshHis smallholding is one of the victims of a creeping water crisis, exacerbated by Egypt’s growing population and the impacts of climate change.

175,http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/359272/Egypt/Politics-/Egypts-water-challenges-Beyond-the-dam-saga-.aspx,Egypt's water challenges: Beyond the dam saga,"Recent months have seen further negotiations between Egypt, Sudan and Ethiopia on the terms under which the latter’s Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam will be filled and operated, with little sign so far of a break in the long-running deadlock.

Egyptian officials have long warned that the mega-dam, being constructed on the Blue Nile in the Ethiopian highlands, could impact the other two countries, which are downstream, and have stressed that Egypt is largely dependent on the Nile for its freshwater resources.

It is clear, however, that Egypt’s water challenges extend beyond the potential impact of the new dam, and to fully understand this vital issue, many other factors, problems and potential solutions need to be taken into account.

With the increase in Egypt’s population to over 100 million, Egypt's water consumption has reached between 105 to 110 billion metres per year.

The annual flow from the Nile has been stable at 55.5 billion cubic metres for many years; Egypt is therefore classified as a country in water poverty.

Experts and researchers say that Egypt has a longstanding problem whereby its share of water remains fixed but its population growth continues, as does economic development, increasing demand.

Egypt suffers from a water deficit of 30 billion cubic meters; it annually needs at least 110 billion cubic meters of water to cover its needs. However, it currently has only 80 billion cubic meters, of which 55.5 billion cubic meters come from the Nile.

To find out more, Ahram Online took a closer look at some of the key issues related to the country’s water challenges.

A growing water crisis

The average availability of freshwater per capita in Egypt has steadily decreased from about 1,893 cubic metres per capita per year in 1959 to about 900 cubic metres in 2000, and then to 700 cubic metres in 2012. This figure puts the country below the threshold of water poverty, which according to the World Bank is 1,000 cubic metres of water per person per year.

Egypt has a high population growth rate, and given this, it is expected that the share of water per capita will continue to decrease to 534 cubic metres by 2030, which is nearly half the international threshold for water poverty.

In addition, the evaporation of surface water from Lake Nasser, Egypt’s vast reservoir, is believed to exceed the previous estimated amount. The current average evaporation rate is 7 millimetres per day,expected to reach 7.3 millimetres by 2050.

Water poverty poses a threat to economic growth and also threatens the quantity and quality of water resources in the country, which exacerbates the current problem of contamination of shallow groundwater from industrial chemicals and overuse of fertilisers and pesticides. In addition, farmers still largely rely on ineffective irrigation methods, resulting in water loss due to evaporation and over-irrigation, and to soil damage.

According to the water resources and irrigation ministry, Egypt already uses 127 percent of its water resources, and will need an additional 20 percent by 2020.

The United Nations expects Egypt to suffer from water scarcity by 2025. Assuming the continued growth of the population and taking into account land reclamation projects in the desert and the fact that more than 50 percent of grains consumed are already imported, Egypt cannot meet its demand for food only by relying on Nile water for irrigation.

Egypt is therefore already using most of its Nile flow, and plans to use more during the upcoming years.

In addition, Egypt is also seeing the effects of climate change, which have affected the Nile Basin countries and, as a result, the flow of the Nile.

Several studies have shown that the Nile is very sensitive to climate change, mainly due to the decline in rainfall rate by 4 percent.

Given these factors, experts agree that Egypt should intensify its search for alternative ways to increase its share of water, whether through desalination of seawater, rationalisation of consumption, and attention to providing new water sources such as re-using wastewater in agriculture and maximising the use of groundwater, in order to face its growing water crisis, which could potentially be exacerbated by the completion of the GERD.

Wasted rainwater

Rainwater, if properly used, could be one of the most important weapons in combating Egypt’s water crisis. According to reports by the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the amount of rain that falls on Egypt is estimated at 51 billion cubic metres annually,which is nearly equivalent to the country’s share of Nile water.

However, Egypt has failed to take advantage of this water resource; only 1.3 billion cubic metres per year are currently used, as this is the amount that falls on the Nile Delta region. The other areas of Egypt, most of which are desert, do not have enough flood waterways or infrastructure to channel rainwater in useful ways.

The agriculture ministry has said in reports that the amount of rainwater that could be used is 13 billion cubic metres, which is sufficient to cultivate 600,000 acres of agricultural land annually.

In recent years, Egypt has developed a strategy to deal with its seasonal bouts of torrential rain, based on two important elements. The first is to reduce the risks of flooding and other damage via methods such as dams, walls, and water crossings, to direct flood water into waterways. The second is to maximise the benefits of this natural phenomenon, turning it into a useful source for water.

In addition, the irrigation ministry has decided to construct a man-made lake to collect flood and rainwater in Hurghada in Red Sea governorate, with a capacity of 5 million cubic metres. The project aims to direct the water to underground reservoirs and therefore provide water to local communities and surrounding villages.

The government also plans to construct a number of dams and industrial lakes in Red Sea governorates and in Upper Egypt at a cost of EGP 400 million, but these projects have not been completed yet.

There is a need to increase the infrastructure for channelling rainwater into reservoirs in desert areas, so this water can be used in agriculture or drinking if needed, as happens in some Gulf countries.

Water experts agree that by maximising rainfall storage projects, Egypt could generate an amount of water that is nearly half its current annual share of Nile water.

""The Renaissance Dam is only part of Egypt’s water problem, not the whole of it,"" Ahmed Fawzy Diab, a senior international water expert, told Ahram Online.

“Far from [focusing on] other sources of water such as desalination of seawater and groundwater, it is necessary to set up the necessary equipment and infrastructure to collect flood water, and to set up climate change prediction techniques, to benefit from rainwater based on geological studies,” he said.

According to Diab, in recent years the state has established several barrier dams, blocking dams and lakes in Sinai, but it has slowed down the process because of the high financial costs.

The lakes have been used in irrigation operations, for filling the underground water reservoirs, and for capturing 5 million cubic metres of rainwater annually.

Diab stresses that rainwater is one of the purest types of water to drink if initially treated properly.

“It is therefore necessary to take advantage of rainwater and flooding by directing it to reservoirs and industrial lakes,” he said, while noting that “most important of all is to rationalise consumption, as Egyptians should know that water is a matter of life or death to them.”

Desalinating seawater

During the 31st educational symposium of the Egyptian armed forces last October, President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi revealed a plan to cut off the supply of Nile water to the northern coast and the Red Sea areas.

These regions would instead get their water from seawater desalination plants, with investments in constructing these plants currently at EGP 200 billion and likely to rise in to EGP 300 billion in 2020.

Egypt has been expanding its desalination projects in recent years, in light of its concerns about water scarcity.

“Desalination of seawater is one of the best, most effective and quickest ways for Egypt to overcome its current water shortage,” water expert Diaa El-Din El-Qousy told Ahram Online.

During a conference on desalination in Arab countries held in 2017, Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly stressed that desalination of seawater is a top priority for Egypt now it has entered the stage of water poverty.

With the steady increase in population and the fixed amount of water resources, it is expected that there will be a steady decrease in the per capita share, he said.

Desalination of seawater is becoming “the strategic choice and a matter of national security for Egypt,” he said.

Madbouly noted that the urban development plan implemented by the state includes a total dependence on desalination of seawater in the new coastal cities, with desalination plants having been established in the new settlements of New Alamein, East Port Said and Galala, with a capacity of 150,000 cubic metres per day each.

Other stations are also being expanded, he said.

For example, Al-Yusr station in Red Sea governorate, has a capacity of 80,000 cubic metres per day, making it the largest operational desalination plant in Egypt.

Work is being done to localise the technology of seawater desalination industry in Egypt in cooperation with the Military Production and the Arab Organization for Industrialization, and the private sector and in cooperation with advanced Arab countries in this field such as Saudi Arabia, said Madbouly.

“Given the country’s extensive marine areas and thousands of kilometres of shoreline, desalination of seawater is an essential resource in bridging the water deficit and achieving self-sufficiency in drinking water,” El-Qousy said.

“Whether before or after the completion of the GERD, Egypt’s share of water is now insufficient…Egypt’s aim from the current negotiations is to limit the negative impacts to the least possible,” El-Qousy noted.

Desalination plants also offer to change the prospects of life in border governorates and remote areas that suffer from water supply problems.

El-Qousy believes that the best solution for Egypt to overcome its water crisis over the course of the coming few years is to establish scattered operations of water desalination plants in its coastal cities.

The amount of drinking water produced in Egypt is estimated daily at 25 million cubic metres per day, 85 percent of which comes from Nile water, while desalinated sea and groundwater, as well other resources, account for the rest.

A total of 63 desalination stations exist at present, with a total production capacity of 800,000 cubic metres per day. They are located in the governorates of North Sinai, South Sinai, Red Sea, Marsa Matrouh, Ismailia and Suez.

An additional 19 stations are under construction at a total cost of EGP 7.9 billion pounds in the governorates of Matrouh, the Red Sea, North Sinai, South Sinai, Port Said and Alexandria. They will have a total capacity of 375,000 cubic metres per day.

Desalination is a very expensive operation, however, and is mainly used by wealthy countries. Globally, only 25 billion cubic metres of desalinated water are produced per year, which represents 6 percent of drinking water in the world. Most of this is produced in Saudi Arabia, the US, Japan, Spain and Kuwait.

In Egypt, desalination costs between EGP 10 to 15 per cubic metre of water, which is very high, with 44 percent of the cost spent on electricity.

Wastewater treatment and re-use

Wastewater is polluted water resulting from different human activities, and the treatment of wastewater is important to protect the environment from effects of pollution.

The irrigation ministry has stressed the necessity of looking for unconventional solutions to the country’s water shortage, with the treatment of wastewater among those solutions, to meet the needs of agriculture and to provide drinking water.

Wastewater can be treated and used for a variety of activities, including for drinking, and this happens in many countries at present, including some European countries. However, these countries have advanced technology and sufficient financial resources to purify wastewater up to the seventh level, which is very costly.

In Egypt, treatment plants only purify wastewater to the second and third levels, therefore the water can only be -re-used to irrigate agricultural land.

While wastewater has been used in agriculture since 1915, the Egyptian state has expanded its use of wastewater for agriculture since the 1990s.

The amount of wastewater generated in Greater Cairo is currently estimated at about 6 million cubic metres per day, but only a very small part of this is used in agriculture.

Some studies indicate that the cost of purifying a cubic metre of wastewater for agricultural purposes ranges from EGP 0.15 piasters to EGP 2.

In addition to its high cost if used for drinking, the use of wastewater in irrigation of agricultural land poses a great risk to human health if not treated properly, due to the presence of different types of bacteria and viruses.

“Egypt is not only facing a problem of water quantity, but it is also facing a big problem in terms of water quality,” water expert Diab said.

“Sanitary and industrial wastewater treatment causes increased pollution rates in irrigation water, due to the lack of sufficient treatment plants,"" Diab argues; however, he stresses that treatment of wastewater will not lead to an increase in the total amount of water, but rather will improve water quality and reduce rates of health and agricultural pollution.

Drinking water consumption in Egypt is estimated at 11 billion cubic metres annually, of which 7 to 8 billion cubic metres are directed to wastewater, while the rest of it is wasted due to the lack of an efficient wastewater management network and weak infrastructure.

“A fundamental solution that the government must take is restructuring the whole wastewater sector in Egypt to achieve the best possible wastewater management,” Diab stresses.

During recent years, Egypt has seen significant progress in wastewater management.

In 2018, President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi opened the expansion of the Al-Gabal Al-Asfar wastewater treatment plant in Qalioubiya in Greater Cairo. The plant currently has a capacity of 500,000 cubic metres per day and serves nearly half of Cairo’s population.

Egypt has also been working on extensive plan to replace dilapidated wastewater networks and construct new ones.

Groundwater

“Egypt has great potential to desalinate ground water, a crucial option to overcome its water crisis,” El-Qousy said.

Groundwater is one of the most important sources of fresh water around the world, and it is present in Egypt in large quantities. Its uses are limited, however, due to both natural and technological factors.

Experts say therefore that while it is not the whole solution, it can form a partial solution to Egypt’s water problem.

Groundwater in Egypt is distinguished by its fixed stock, although the underground reservoir contains large quantities of water, but it is a reservoir that is replenished in some places and not renewed in many regions, especially the eastern and western desert regions and the Sinai Peninsula.

However, the use of groundwater can compensate to solving water shortage if done with certain precautions, because when drawing from these reservoirs is thoughtlessly, the percentage of soil salinity in them increases, which affects the entire environment.

“The Egyptian government should set limitations and regulate the use of groundwater wells, because they are non-renewable,” El-Qousy said, stressing that groundwater is a strategic water stock for Egypt for future generations.

Groundwater is different to reservoirs, he explained; the subterranean reservoir in the Nile Valley and Deltais a renewed reservoir because it depends on the infiltration of water from the Nile.

‘To maximise the utilization of groundwater, its use must not exceed 10 percent, so it can only be a partial solution to the water problem, especially in desert areas characterised by non-renewable geological groundwater reservoirs,” he said.

“Egypt’s stock of groundwater has existed since the rainy ages, which ended thousands of years ago, therefore its source has finished, and the current sources of renewal are confined to leaching from the Nile, or coming across the ground from Africa.

“Studies must be done to regulate the process of using groundwater, linking it to the amount that it is replenished annually,” he added.

Groundwater is the second biggest source of fresh water in Egypt after the Nile. In addition, it is the only resource for desert land, which make up about 96 percent of the country’s area. For these reasons, the state has been focused on this source and has been studying its potential utilisation for more than six decades.

In 2015, the state launched a vast agricultural project to cultivate 1.5 million feddans of desert land around the country. This huge project depends on groundwater for 88.5 percent of its water and on the Nile for 11.5 percent, with the aim of achieving self-sufficiency.

The project was divided into three phases includes the digging of more than 5,000 ground water wells at a cost of 70 billion EGP in eight governorates, mainly Ismailia, Qena, Marsa Matrouh, Al-Wadi Al-Gedid, and Aswan.

The irrigation minister stressed that the water management for the project is based on integrated studies carried out by the National Water Research Center, with the aim of optimising agricultural and urban investment within the limits of high safety precautions that ensure the sustainability of the underground reservoir.

Improving irrigation techniques

President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi said in 2018 that using modern irrigation and agricultural methods would save the country a huge amount of water that could be utilised in other sectors, and called on Egyptians to be careful when using each drop of water.

During the inauguration of the first phase of a project to establish greenhouses on an area of 100,000 acres in Marsa Matrouh governorate, El-Sisi said that the projects were not “luxuries,” but important projects that should be taken seriously by the government and citizens.

The greenhouse projects consume around 70 percent less water than traditional agricultural methods and can produce high-quality agricultural crops out of season.

El-Sisi said that the cost of constructing greenhouses is high, but saving water is vital.

Water experts say that other modern agriculture and irrigation methods can rationalise water consumption and drastically save large amount of water as well.

""Globally speaking, the main water problem is that the amount of rain is fixed and the land area, the seas and oceans are fixed, and therefore the amount of steam and clouds formed is constant, at a time when humans are increasing significantly, and thus the problem is a global one, not just one for Egypt,” El-Qousy said.

This month, the government announced a national plan to rationalise water and maximise the use of available resources in Egypt through 2037 at a cost of $50 billion, which aims to overcome problems related to water shortages.

The plan is based on four main axes: improving water quality and quality, rationalisation of use, water resource development, and creating an appropriate environment. It aims to provide alternative sources of drinking water, through desalination of water in coastal governorates, the establishment of groundwater extraction stations, and the re-use of treated water in some plantations.

The plan also includes the introduction of modern and technological irrigation systems, and working through specialised research centres to develop crops that consume less water, while reducing the time for crop growth.

It is expected that this plan will have a major impact on how water is used in Egypt, especially since the irrigation ministry said last year there was a state of emergency due to an expected decrease in water supplies in 2019 by about 5 billion cubic metres compared to the previous year.

The ministry attributed the expected decrease in the country's share of the Nile River water to the decrease in the rate of rainfall in the Nile Basin countries.

Traditional Egyptian irrigation methods used in the Nile Delta and Valley use large amounts of water, and in addition, it is difficult to convert the irrigation in these lands to modern methods.

According to the agriculture ministry statistics from 2019, a major problem is the overuse of old flooding irrigation techniques by farmers, especially in the Nile Delta and Valley, in addition to the lack of periodic maintenance of small lakes, the lack of which prevent large amounts of water from reaching waterways.

Another difficulty is the fact that a large part of the Delta lands in particular must be irrigated by flooding, which uses large amounts of water but prevents salinizing of the soil.

According to the information released by the agriculture ministry, the government is encouraging farmers to change irrigation methods. In 2018, 250,000 acres were cultivated with the more efficient irrigation system favoured by the government.

The ministry has said that the agricultural development strategy of 2030 depends on the optimal use of agricultural water resources and irrigation water, agricultural labour and capital and technological management, in order to increase agricultural production by 1.4 percent annually, thereby achieving both better rates of food security and water consumption levels.

There is significant conflict over access and rights to Nile water resources among the 11 riparian countries of the Nile Basin. Known for centuries as ‘the gift of the Nile’, Egypt is dependent on the river for virtually all of its water. Any development of infrastructure projects by the upstream riparians, such as dams, irrigation networks and pipelines, is considered a threat to Egypt’s interests regarding Nile water.

In 1999, all the riparian countries established the NBI in an attempt to strengthen cooperation and provide a forum for consultation and coordination among the basin states for the sustainable management and development of the shared Nile Basin water and related resources. Yet, since 2007, an ongoing dispute over the Cooperative Framework Agreement (CFA) has stalled the negotiations. The essence of the dispute is whether or not the CFA should recognize current water use of the downstream countries and colonial-era treaties, specifically an agreement between Egypt and Sudan from 1959, which the downstream countries consider to preclude upstream countries from developing their water resources without the consent of downstream countries. Downstream countries have been insisting on an explicit recognition of what they consider their historic water use and rights, while upstream riparians insist on their right to develop their water resources, which could significantly impact downstream river flows.

Tensions came to a head in 2011 when Ethiopia announced the construction of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), Africa’s largest dam. Sudan has been largely peripheral in the disputes over GERD, downplaying the dam’s potentially negative effects and throwing its support behind Ethiopia, while Egypt views the construction of GERD as a threat to its national security because of its potentially negative impact on Egypt’s water resources.","Disputed Surface and Groundwater ResourcesThere is significant conflict over access and rights to Nile water resources among the 11 riparian countries of the Nile Basin.

The Cause And Effect Of Water Pollution In Egypt

Water is the basis of life, which is without the life can not exist. It is a source of drinking water for humans and animals and the source of agriculture. Also, it is essential factor for the industry. Thus, our lives on the planet are linked to water and the great River Nile is the lifeblood of life in Egypt. Its revenue is used for domestic use, agriculture and manufacturing so that confirms our lives linked to water. The share of Egypt from the Nile is 55.5 billion cubic meters annually, under an agreement signed in 1959. Despite the growing number of Egypt’s population reaching nearly 62 million the Egypt’s share was not increasing, which means that per capita water from the river had fallen considerably (Tahlawi, M. & Farrag, S,2007). In addition, water quality of the River Nile decreased as a result of chemical and industrial processes, wastewater plants, and runoff.

Chemical And Industrial Processes:

The main reason behind the water pollution is chemical and industrial processes. This is because the factories and manufacturers in Egypt are throwing industrial and animal waste into streams and rivers that lead to environmental and health problems. The second reason is thermal pollution which is caused by heating water that leads to reduce the amount of oxygen in the water which in turn leads to death of the animals, plants and change in water temperature. Furthermore, there are other reasons that contribute to water pollution such as organic and inorganic pollutants, plastic waste and pesticides. For instance, pesticides and chemical fertilizers cause to increase the amount of nutrient in the water that provide suitable environment to grow algae in water. This contributes to diminish the quantity of oxygen in the water, which lead to death of marine animals. However, water pollution will leads to contamination of soil will cause problems that related to human health and nutrition. The contamination of soil occurs by direct contamination such as using of pesticides for agricultural purposes or waste factories. Also it may occur by indirect contamination when water mixed with chemical a material which leads to leads to poor fertility and low crop production. Furthermore, some of harmful chemical materials will affect on plants and natural composition. This will reduce the mount of nutritional value. However, not only does soil contamination relate to plants, but it also relate to human and animals. Where the contamination of food crops lead to cause health problems owing to eat Food plants or animals (Laurel, J. & Ruthann, A & Swartz, K. ,2008).

Wastewater Plants:

Not only does water pollution occur by chemical and industrial processes, but it also caused by wastewater plants. Campaigns have demonstrated the results of monitoring carried out by the ministries of health, housing, irrigation show that wastewater plants contaminate the groundwater in the villages and agricultural areas. These problems will cause to speared disease among those people who do not have clean drinking water supply. Groundwater is an important source for drinking and irrigation. The wasteful use and pollution by harmful substances is a continuing threat to this important source of fresh water. It is exposed to pollution due to irregularities waste plants, oil pipelines, mining, and radioactive materials. Therefore, The Ministry of State for Environmental Affairs is faced this phenomenon of Nile river pollution by implementation of the Environmental Protection Law. This new law led to the concerted efforts between various ministries and agencies which are contributed of deal with 100 million cubic meters of polluted wastewater had been dumped on the river. These efforts will continue to require all industrial establishments and tourist not exchange on the Nile water in order to protect it from any contamination (Tahlawi, M. & Farrag, S.,2007).

Runoff:

Runoff which is come from storms is not clear water because it contains a huge amount of wastes. Furthermore, it considers one of the most serious sources of pollution compared with municipal wastes. There are many studies which have been done by scientist in order to define the problem and resolve it. The writers show that urban runoff can lead to many problems such as direct pollution and overloading which is came from sewage treatment facilities. So writers refer these problems to hydraulic overloading and other kinds of pollution that come with runoff. However, the writers indicate that there is report one providing many solutions in order to reduce water pollution through banding source pollution and improving of level of methods and techniques for checking the street surface pollution. However, also there is research have been made by URS Company in order to collect information about source, quantities, and pollutant properties of street surface pollution and it found a huge amount of information that the pollution related with storm water and sewer system (James, D. & Gail, B & Franklin, J,1974).

From the above, it is clear the extent of contamination incident was the result of human activity on sea coasts and rivers. Also it is because of throw a cargo of sewage, industrial and agricultural in sea coasts and rivers. These harmful factors lead to decreased water quality in the River Nile. However, human consumption of water has increased rapidly with the increase in population numbers significantly Thus increasing the demand for water, at the time remained when the quantity of water resources on earth steady. Also with a shortage of cultivated land to be the protection of water and its sources of pollution in this age of the quantity and quality, and increasing the need to rationalize consumption and saved it is important. Also the right of future generations is to maintain the great river Nile. Also working to rationalize the consumption of water until it finds their children and grandchildren a clean and suitable for use for the purposes of life. Finally, drinking water should be protecting from waste and pollution.

180,https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2019/08/egypt-water-resources-plan-nile-flood-drop-5--million-bcm.html,Egypt declares water emergency as precaution,"Sibai said, “According to the ministry’s Nile Flood Forecasting Center 's data on the amount of rainfall on the Ethiopian plateau [and equatorial lakes] during the current rainy season, flood rates are still moderate,” meaning there won't be any extra water to increase the storage level in the Aswan High Dam reservoir.

The government imposed a state of emergency in all governorates to regulate and manage water, especially to meet water needs for drinking and domestic use. ""Egypt's annual water quota … will not be affected by the decline,"" Sibai said. “A state of emergency means keeping all of the Water Ministry’s departments on maximum alert to periodically follow up on the water situation in the main riverbed and all canals and water channels in the governorates.""

The ministry reported July 27 that the total annual Nile River flow dropped 5 billion cubic meters (1.3 trillion gallons, or 6.5 billion cubic yards) from the year before due to decreased floodwaters from the Ethiopian plateau and equatorial lakes.

“The job of an irrigation engineer in Egypt has changed,"" Mohammed al-Sibai, spokesman for the Ministry of Water Resources and Irrigation, told Al-Monitor. ""We no longer manage water flooding but manage water scarcity, and make precise plans to deal with it, so as not to harm the main interests and the citizens’ needs.”

CAIRO — Though water-scarce Egypt is on the verge of flood season, Cairo has declared a state of emergency due to a decline in water flow from last year. Yet water experts say the country is in good enough shape because of its reserves and water conservation measures.

Floodwaters flow into the Nile and then into the man-made Lake Nasser reservoir, created by the Aswan High Dam in Aswan province. Some of the flow comes from rain in Ethiopia's hills. Another source is water that Sudan discharges from its dams to accommodate the new season's floodwater coming from the Ethiopian plateau.

The annual water flow from the Nile is estimated at an average of 84 billion cubic meters of water. Egypt gets 55.5 billion cubic meters of water a year from this flow, while Sudan receives 18.5 billion cubic meters under the 1959 Nile Waters Agreement. The rest of the river's flow is stored behind the Aswan High Dam and is considered a strategic stock for Egypt in case of water shortage or droughts.

Egypt is diligent about monitoring water availability. “In addition to the declining water flow, Egypt is dealing with a water gap that is widening every year,"" Sibai said. ""Internal needs are now estimated at 114 billion cubic meters annually, while only 59.4 billion cubic meters of running surface water is available.""

Sibai said, “The water deficit will be fixed through water recycling projects, which provide 24 billion cubic meters of water. Egypt is now one of the top countries in terms of water-use efficiency, reaching a rate of 95%, according to international estimates."" Egypt also imports food and industrial products that, if grown or made internally, would require 34 billion cubic meters of water.

Despite the water scarcity in Egypt, ""the water year 2018-2019 has ended well,"" Sibai said. ""The daily challenges and problems that farmers face were dealt with in a number of ways, as endorsed in the 2017-2037 Water Resources Plan between nine ministries."" The plan addresses four areas: developing water resources, improving water quality, making water use more efficient while reducing the amount used, and community awareness.

According to experts in Egyptian water affairs, the decrease in the Nile River's flow from floodwater may not present a major danger at the present time, given Egypt's strategic water reserves in the Aswan Dam, in addition to the absence of serious climatic events such as the drought that hit the Nile basin in the 1980s.

Abbas Sharaqi, a water and geology professor at Cairo University, told Al-Monitor Egypt's current water scarcity is mainly due to its population growth, not the lower water flow from the Ethiopian plateau or equatorial lakes.

“The main rainy season in Ethiopia, which feeds the Nile, is in July, August and September, and the water reaches Egypt three weeks after the rainy season begins. The amount of floodwater can't be judged before the season ends in September,"" Sharaqi said.

""It's not possible to be in real danger, as long as there is a strategic water reservoir in the Aswan Dam, and official figures indicate that the water level there is so far within the safe limits,"" he said. “The most important challenge is to maintain safe [levels] of water in Lake Nasser.”

The decline in the Nile's water flow is a chronic but manageable challenge for the Egyptian government. Ethiopia had delayed filling the estimated 74 billion cubic meters of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam reservoir due to internal tensions. Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn resigned in February 2018; the dam project manager killed himself that July, according to authorities; and dam officials were arrested on corruption charges. Meanwhile, Cairo has yet to reach a clear agreement with Ethiopia to set common rules for filling the dam reservoir and avoiding any harm.

But last month, Egyptian Minister of Water Resources and Irrigation Mohamed Abdel Ati led an official delegation to Sudan and Ethiopia to discuss resuming negotiations and present Ethiopia with Egypt's vision of the rules for filling the Renaissance Dam.

Speaking about the effectiveness of such steps, Sibai said, “Leaderships in Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan do not trust one another, and we recognize the parties' appreciation of how critical the situation is. The issue is being managed by virtue of agreements and treaties that guarantee no harm is done to any party.”","The annual water flow from the Nile is estimated at an average of 84 billion cubic meters of water.

The Minister’s comments result from an international classification of nations of decreasing per capita of water, as reported by Egypt Independent.

For the last couple of years, Egypt has been the focus of climate various reports which have adamantly secured Egypt’s placement as a country in high-risk of water problems in the near future due to water scarcity. According to the Guardian, the UN predicts that Egypt will be approaching a state of “absolute water crisis” by 2025 and that the nation is already below the United Nations’ water poverty threshold.

Egyptians are not usually made aware of sustainable water consumption practices, with luxury fountains continuously built in shopping malls and artificial gardens set up in the outskirts of Cairo where the Nile doesn’t reach.

The Minister explained that due to Egypt’s booming population, there is a added pressure to secure food resources by increasing demand on water for irrigation and agricultural purposes. As such, the Ministry believes that the rates of the increasing population must be contained.

The Egyptian government has already dedicated more efforts to family planning initiatives, with the ‘‘Etnein Kefaya (Two is Enough)” campaign launched recently by the Ministry of Social Solidarity in order to get curb the number of children in Egypt, particularly in the most populated areas.

Last month, the government has raised the price of piped drinking water up to 46.5% for consumers of all consumption tier.

For residential use, the prices range between LE0.65 to LE2.25 per cubic meter and for commercial use, prices range from LE3 to LE10, depending on industry and consumption levels.

In the recent years, water scarcity in North Africa has undoubtedly grown to become a serious issue, especially in Egypt. Egypt faces a rapid population growth while agricultural land is not much available at the same rate, and this is just one of the many reasons leading to scarcity of water in Egypt.

For the last couple of years, Egypt has been the focus of climate various reports which have adamantly secured Egypt’s placement as a country in high-risk of water problems in the near future due to water scarcity. The UN predicts that Egypt will be approaching a state of “absolute water crisis” by 2025 and that the nation is already below the United Nations’ water poverty threshold.

As such, Egypt’s standing is below the level of water poverty and the country is suffering from water scarcity stated Egypt’s Minister of Agriculture and Land Reclamation Ezz Eddin Abo Setit last month. Indeed, the country suffers a shortage of water that reaches 54 billion cubic meters, and it needs a total of 114 billion cubic meters in order to cover its needs from water for agricultural, industrial and households needs. Egypt’s current resources only provide about 60 billion cubic meters.

Here are some of the significant factors that are affecting the water situation in Egypt.

1. Population explosion

The rate at which Egypt’s population is growing is alarming. The growth rate has increased by 41 percent as from the 1990s. To give you just a glimpse of how fast the population growth rate is, the government of Egypt states that around 4,700 babies are born every week in Egypt.

Currently, Egypt’s population is estimated to be around 97 million inhabitants and risks jumping to 151 million by 2050; Egypt ranks 13th in terms of population worldwide.

In the upcoming years, Egypt’s growing population will provide additional challenges to its already limited resources, social stability and economy. Accordingly, the Ministry of Social Solidarity launched an an aggressive two-year project called ”2 Kefaya (Two [children] is enough)” at the end of May in order to get curb the number of children in Egypt, particularly in the most populated areas.

Rapid population growth means an increased demand of water in the whole country not forgetting that the primary source of water is the River Nile. A third of its water gets lost by pumping low salinity drainage water into the Mediterranean Sea thus utilizing expensive electric power.

2. Pollution

The pollution of the River Nile is often underestimated; this is an important fact considering the importance of the river to the population of Egypt.

Most people depend on the river for drinking water, municipal water, and agricultural water thus it is vital to them. The painful reality is the fact that the river has been polluted by harmful chemical industrial waste, sewage leakages, municipal wastes, and dumping of dead animal carcasses, to mention a few, which has a significant risk to humans, animals and also agricultural production.

3. Inefficient Irrigation

Egypt receives very little rainfall of less than 80mm per year which means that the way to utilize agricultural land is through irrigation. The irrigation techniques, however, have not been appropriately implemented; this has lead to excessive watering and loss of water through evaporation. Most of the irrigation network in Egypt is from the Aswan high damn (Nasser’s dam); it regulates more than 18,000 miles of canals and sub-canals which irrigate farms adjacent to the river.

However, with the system being inefficient, it looses around 3 billion cubic meters of Nile water every year as per PRI. The inefficiency has led to not only a decrease in water supply but also a decline in arable land that is available for agriculture which has led to many people being unemployed as well.

4. Regional upheavals.

Egypt has had significant control of water extracted from the Nile River since the colonial-era treaty which ensured Egypt had a 90 percent share of the river. This prevented neighboring countries from the extraction of water from the Nile without Egypt’s permission. With time, Egypt has lost grip on the Nile, and countries like Ethiopia are creating dams along the river which is a big concern for the people of Egypt especially during dry months. Previously President Abdel Fattah Al Sisi has stated that, Egypt’s right to its water share of the Nile river was a “matter of life or death”.

Egypt’s main concern since the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) establishment in 2011 Its high storage capacity reaches 74bn cubic meters.

As per agreements signed in 1929 and 1959 in Ethiopia’s absence, downstream countries Egypt and Sudan together receive the majority of Nile Water. Egypt annually receives 55.5bn cubic metres of the estimated total 84bn cubic metres of Nile water produced each year, while Sudan receives 18.5bn cubic metres. Britain had signed the initial 1929 on behalf of Egypt, its then-colony.

Ethiopia began constructing the dam in 2011 and since then Egypt and Ethiopia have been locked in a diplomatic dispute, which reached a peak in 2013, following ousted President Mohamed Morsi’s threats.

Water availability is an issue that is continuously growing in Egypt every day with the climate being expected continually get drier and hotter over time. The consumption of water increases with the increase in the population of the Egyptians. With the country slowly loosening the grip of River Nile, it is crucial that the government acts decisively, and swiftly to implement water conservation measures like water recycling and control the water pollution at the River Nile.

Egypt’s Prime Minister Mostafa Mabouly revealed on 14 October that Egypt plans to treat sewage water and reuse it in agriculture and plantations.

Mohamed Mustafa, Chief Executive of Egyptian Water and Wastewater Regulatory Agency, said that they will study the quality of drinking water to come up with effective wastewater treatment solutions.

According to Sayed Ismail, deputy head of Project Management Unit (PMU), Egypt’s sanitation program wants to focus on increasing the productivity of wastewater management companies to ultimately provide a sustainable solution to drinking water and effective sanitation services.

As a result of Egypt’s water shortage, farmers in the Delta region and Upper Egypt have been facing trouble watering their crops during cultivation.

Water scarcity has also been a problem in new agricultural plants including Wadi al-Noqra plant located in Aswan. Al- Gedaan talk show reported that farmers in Aswan receive water bimonthly which has a great negative impact on their crops. The reuse of wastewater will help farmers during irrigation.

There is a huge gap between the amount of water Egypt produces and the amount locals consume. Egypt’s annual consumption is 110 trillion liters while it only produced about 60 billion liters. To fill the gap, the country exports about 34 trillion liters to provide sufficient water used for drinking and agriculture.

In a report published by the Central Agency for Public Mobilization and Statistics (CAPMAS), every individual’s share of water has decreased by 60 percent since 1970.

The water that will be treated by wastewater treatment plants will be directed for agriculture. The amount of water that is used for agriculture could then be used for drinking and individuals’ consumption.

According to Egypt Today, Egypt’s Minister of Water Resources and Irrigation Mohamed Abdel Atti revealed that the plant will be build in the east of the Suez Canal and will launch in 2021.

In April, Egypt’s Minister of Irrigation Mohamed Abdel Atty said that Egypt suffers a shortage of water that reaches 54 billion cubic meters, and it needs a total of 114 billion cubic meters in order to cover its needs from water for agricultural, industrial and households needs.

Additionally, highlighting the looming problem of future water scarcity in Egypt, a report published by the BBC suggested that Egypt’s capital of Cairo is most likely to run out of water due to the untreated agricultural and residential waste.

El-Sisi made the statement during a phone call with his South African counterpart Cyril Ramaphosa on Saturday as the two heads of state discussed the disputed Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD).

According to Presidency Spokesman Bassam Rady, El-Sisi said Egypt insists on the formulation of a full-fledged legal agreement between the concerned parties regarding the rules of filling and operation of the dam.

Egypt, Sudan and Ethiopia have been engaged in online talks sponsored by the African Union (AU), which is currently headed by South Africa, for nearly a month to reach an accord over the mega-dam on the Blue Nile.

Over years of negotiations, Ethiopia has always backtracked on signing a binding deal, including during the talks brokered by Washington that faltered in February when Ethiopia didn't show up at the final round of negotiations, and also during Sudan-brokered talks in June that led to Egypt escalating the matter to the United Nations Security Council.

During a press conference in Addis Ababa on Friday, Ethiopian foreign ministry spokesman Dina Mufti said Ethiopia wants a non-binding agreement on the GERD.

“The Ethiopian government does not look for a binding agreement concerning the current talks about GERD, only a guidelines agreement which can be revised at any time,” Mufti said.

Ethiopia hopes the massive $4.8 billion dam will allow it to become Africa’s largest power exporter. On the other hand, Egypt, which relies on the Blue Nile for 95 percent of its freshwater, fears the dam will diminish its water supply, which is already below scarcity level.

Egypt is not the only party that has repeatedly demanded the agreement be legally binding. Sudan has also raised the same concern at the end of the Khartoum-brokered negotiations that reached deadlock last month, and again in its three-page letter to the United Nations Security Council later in June.

Among the disputed legal terms that Sudan mentioned in its letter is the ""binding nature of the agreement."" It proposed a draft agreement that ""ensured that the agreement to be signed will be legally binding and cannot be amended or terminated without the agreement of all three parties.""

However, Sudan's letter said Ethiopia proposed a document of ""guidelines"" that can be revised and in some cases terminated.

On Thursday Sudanese Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok stated that reaching a binding agreement on the filling and operation of the GERD is a necessity for paving the way for future cooperation on the Nile.

Rady added in the presidency statement that the El-Sisi and Ramaphosa tackled during their phone call the latest developments on GERD within the framework of what was discussed during the mini-African summit held on Tuesday.

The AU issued a statement on Friday on behalf of its chairman Ramaphosa in which it stressed the heads of state and governments “agreed on the process of finalising negotiations on the text of a binding agreement on the filling and operation of GERD, which includes a comprehensive agreement on future developments on the Blue River.”

The presidential spokesperson added that Ramaphosa expressed during the phone call his aspiration for the continuation of intensive coordination between the two countries on the issue of the $4.8 billion dam to reach a fair and balanced agreement for all parties on this vital issue.

The Egyptian and South African presidents also discussed the latest on Libya, the statement said, as they exchanged viewpoints on how to activate the political settlement negotiations within the framework of the Berlin process and the ""Cairo Declaration"" initiative in an effort to undermine the dangers of terrorism, extremist militias and external interference that threaten regional security and stability.

The Cairo Declaration is a recent joint political initiative announced last month in Cairo by President El-Sisi, commander of the Libyan National Army Khalifa Haftar, and Libya's parliament speaker Aguila Saleh to resolve the Libyan crisis and end the armed conflict in the Egypt’s western neighbour.

The initiative, which was welcomed by various foreign and Arab countries, mandates an intra-Libyan resolution as a basis for resolving the country’s conflict under resolutions by the UN and past efforts in Paris, Rome, Abu Dhabi, and most recently in Berlin.

Shoukry told Alghad TV on Sunday that causing “significant harm is illegitimate under international law,” stressing that Egyptian authorities cannot stand by without dealing with matter “firmly.”

The FM affirmed the necessity of reaching an agreement, adding that failure to reach a deal would further increase tensions, which Cairo is trying to avoid.

He said any agreement should be binding, referring to Ethiopia’s refusal to agree to binding terms, and stressed that there must be a willingness to reach an agreement.

The Egyptian foreign minister made the statements after the 11th day of virtual talks saw the persistence of differences on major issues regarding the rules of filling and operating the dam.

The Egyptian announcement came following a meeting on Monday between the legal and technical committees of the three countries and another meeting between the countries' irrigation ministers to discuss the points of contention on both aspects.

The points of difference pressed by Egypt were mainly Ethiopia's failure to agree on rules for regulating the filling and operation of the GERD during drought, prolonged drought, and dry years.

The differences also include the rules for re-filling following a prolonged drought as well as the annual operation of the giant dam, the construction on which started near the Sudanese border in 2011.

The three countries' irrigation ministers agreed to submit on Tuesday to South Africa, the current president of the AU, their final reports concerning the path of negotiations in preparation for holding a mini-African summit.

Meanwhile, Ethiopia confirmed that “no breakthrough deal” was made in the latest round of talks, despite “progresses,” Ethiopian Water, Irrigation and Energy Minister Seleshi Bekele said on Twitter on Monday.

Bekele said that “the negotiations are expected to continue after a review by the President of the AU, AU Bureau members and the leaders of the three countries.”

The latest talks come as Ethiopia remains adamant to start filling the GERD reservoir this month to take advantage of the current heavy rain season, regardless of whether or not an agreement is reached with Egypt and Sudan.

The two downstream countries have repeatedly called on Ethiopia not to take any unilateral action concerning the filling of the dam.

Egypt, which relies on the Nile for 95 percent of its fresh water, fears the dam will significantly reduce the river’s flow, especially during the filling stages through periods of drought, extended drought and dry years. Ethiopia, on the other hand, says the project is key to its development.

The project draws the attention of the world to potential unrest in the relations between Ethiopia, on one hand, a key player in the Horn of Africa, and Egypt, on the other hand, a strategic country in the central pivot of the three continents of Africa, Asia, and Europe and one that maintains balance, peace and security in the Arab Region and the Middle East.

Ethiopia’s Violation of International Law

The GERD project unilaterally launched in April of 2011 by Ethiopia on the Blue Nile, the largest tributary of the Nile (the world's longest river) was seen by Egyptians as a project that took advantage of Egypt's political vacuum immediately after the forced resignation of its president at that time. The launching of the Dam construction without consultation with Egypt was seen as a violation of the principles of international law, the 1993 agreement signed between Ethiopia and Egypt, and the 1902 agreement signed between Ethiopia and the United Kingdom, which necessitates consultation with downstream countries on Ethiopian structures that may affect the flows of Nile headwaters through the Blue Nile, Lake Tana, and the Sobat River flowing downstream to Sudan and Egypt. Ethiopia seems to see the Nile river headwaters originating within its territories as a matter of absolute sovereignty and that agreements signed between Ethiopia and Egypt or the United Kingdom (on behalf of Egypt and/or Sudan) as ‎non-binding to Ethiopia.

Unfortunately, there was no comprehensive Hydraulic Impact Assessment, Environmental Impact Assessment, or Socio-economic Impact Assessment Studies that were conducted on the GERD and publicly shared by Ethiopia, or consulted upon with the affected downstream countries, Egypt and Sudan. These measures that Ethiopia ignore dare actually required by international law. Even when an international consultant was agreed by the three countries to conduct the joint impact assessment studies, after the fact, the consultant’s joint studies were halted at their inception by Ethiopia,which pressured the consultant to redefine the “baseline conditions” to include Ethiopia’s future plans for additional dams as part of the existing baseline conditions; a tweak of globally agreed terminology that would defeat the whole purpose of the impact assessment studies. Ethiopia’s avoidance to attend the final meeting in a series of USA-World Bank facilitated negotiations in the end of January 2020, and Ethiopia’s announcement to start the filling of the GERD in July of 2020 before reaching a final agreement with Egypt and Sudan, may be seen as another breach to international law, since it would be breaching the GERD Declaration of Principles (DOP) signed by the three countries in 2015. The DOP stipulated that the three countries are toagree on guidelines and rules on the first filling and annual operation of GERD, which means that the first filling should not take place without an agreement between the three countries on those guidelines and rules.

What does the Nile & the Blue Nile mean to Egypt?

Unlike any other river in the world, the Nile, and more importantly the Blue Nile, for Egypt is a matter of life and death. The Greek Historian, Herodotus, once said that ""Egypt is the Gift of the Nile"". To put this statement in technical terms, let's examine the following factual information. 85% of the Nile waters flowing to Egypt originate in Ethiopia through the Blue Nile, Atbara, and Sobat tributaries. 67% of the Nile water allocated and/or actually being used by Egypt and Sudan comes through the Blue Nile. The Average annual flow of the Blue Nile is about 50 Billion Cubic Meters (BCM) per year, while Egypt's historical uses, acquired and documented water rights allocation is 55.5 BCM/year. Theoretically speaking, one may also consider that the Blue Nile flows out of Ethiopia represent in volume, 90% of Egypt's historical water uses of the Nile. The Nile River is the only source of renewable water for Egypt, which depends on the Nile in meeting about 97% of its water needs.GERD and the Ethiopian attitude in dealing with the issue are threatening the destiny of Egypt’s lifeline, livelihood and national security.

Infringement attempts on Egypt’s 55.5 BCM Water Rights

Although the announced objective of the GERD is for hydropower generation, yet the Ethiopian strategy in negotiating the agreement on filling and operating rules since the unilateral Ethiopian decision to build the dam,may suggest a far more different objective than hydropower generation. Almost 10 years of Ethiopian procrastination had passed without reaching an agreement with downstream Egypt and Sudan.Ethiopia’s future plans shows that Ethiopia may be planning to use water storage behind the GERD Dam for consumptive use purposes such as irrigated agriculture, industrial and others. Studies have shown that, due to the exaggerated 74 BCM capacity of the GERD reservoir design, and the anticipated operational rules to maximize hydropower generation,the accumulative impacts of the associated seepage and evaporation losses from the reservoir behind the GERD Dam, can have detrimental effects on the Blue Nile river flows and hence would likely infringe on Egypt’s ability to continue to use its water rights and annual historical uses of 55.5 BCM.

Ethiopian positions during negotiations and press releases after meetings have been aiming at having a free hand on the Ethiopian headwaters of the Nile andattempting to strip Egypt off of its rights to its meager Nile share of 55.5 Billion Cubic Meters (BCM)/year. The Ethiopian official andmedia language has always been trying to discredit Egypt’s water rights, using phrases such as “contested Egypt shares”, and “Egypt’s claimed 55.5 BCM”. They repeatedly misinform the international community about the full water potential of the Nile Basin and attempt to mislead it by alluding to myths such as “Egypt is using all the waters of the Nile”.

An article published on April 2nd, 2020 by Ethiopia Insight, referred to Ethiopian negotiators indicating that “Egypt and the USA (during the 2019/2020 US-World Bank facilitated negotiations) had proposed an un-amendable plan, which amounted to a “water-allocation” arrangement that effectively protects Egypt’s claimed 55.5 BCM annual share of Nile waters.” Other than the fact that the draft February 21st, 2020 GERD agreement (rejected by Ethiopia) was a result of the facilitated 2019/2020 negotiations between Ethiopia, Egypt, and Sudan, and is not an Egypt-USA proposed plan, the agreement is drafted to ensure that GERD filling and operation does not significantly harm on Egypt and Sudan.

It was not a “water allocation” arrangement, but it was an agreement that, while attempting to maximize hydropower generation for Ethiopia, also attempts to minimize significant harm impacts by the GERD on Egypt’s and Sudan’s ability to continue to use their water rights and historical water uses. Any attempts to ignore these impacts may be considered aninfringement on Egypt’s and Sudan’swater rights. On the other hand, if GERD’s objective is hydropower generation which is supposedly a non-consumptive use, why does Ethiopia bring into the discussions Egypt’s right to its share of 55.5 BCM/year and why does it try to disclaim Egypt of this right?!Speaking of equitable utilization, is it too much for Egypt that hosts 20% of the Nile Basin countries’ population to benefit from only 3% of the Nile Basin’s 1660 BCM/year of the Nile Basin’s rainfall, or from even 0.8% of the 7000 BCM/year of Nile countries’ rainfall?! Ethiopia actually benefits from 23% of the Nile basin’s rainfall or 12% from the Nile countries’ rainfall. It is definitely a far more different reason than lack of water resources in Ethiopia that drives its infringement on neighboring countries’ water rights. To confirm that and to shed some more light on this matter, let’s examine Ethiopia’s renewable water resources.

Ethiopia’s Rainfall is Green Water for Ethiopia & Blue Water for Egypt

Ethiopia is endowed with an abundance of rainfall averaging about 848 mm/year, while Egypt, according to the United Nations Food & Agriculture Organization (FAO), is considered the country with the lowest rainfall rate in the world with about 18.1 mm/year. Ethiopia depends mainly on the direct rainfall (Green Water) in its consumptive uses, and on river flows (Blue Water) in hydropower generation, whereas Egypt is the most downstream country on the Nile River shared by 11 countries, and it depends,for its consumptive and non-consumptive uses,on the Nile River flows (Blue Water) originating outside its political boundaries and running through its desert lands. That’s why, for food production, Ethiopia mainly depends on rainfed agriculture, while Egypt mainly depends on irrigated agriculture. This is also reflected in Ethiopia’s largest livestock population in Africa with over 106 million heads, feeding on vast rainfed grazing lands, while Egypt, due to its water scarcity, is importing the majority of its livestock and meat products, and is the largest importer of wheat in the world. Livestock in Ethiopia is estimated to consume about 84 BCM/year of virtual water embedded in its natural rainfed (green water) feed and fodder. That’s equal to the whole natural Nile river flows at Aswan, and more than Egypt’s and Sudan’s Nile annual water shares combined (74 BCM). Egypt, on the other hand, with about 19 million heads of livestock, consumes one sixth of Ethiopia’s livestock water consumption, with only 14 BCM/year of virtual water embedded in irrigated feed (blue water) and mostly imported fodder. Comparing the impact of rainfall on land cover in Ethiopia and Egypt which are of similar surface area of around one million square kilometer, and according to the European Space Agency (ESA) satellite land cover imagery analysis, about 94% of Ethiopia’s surface area is green cover(rainfed agriculture, pasture, and forests) using “green water”,while about 94% of Egypt’s surface area is desert lands, with a thin valley running through, along the “blue water” of the Nile River.

Where does Ethiopia’s 936 BCM of Annual Rainfall go?!

According to FAO, Ethiopia receives an average of about 936 BCM/year of rainfall. Where does this water go!? Based on ESA land cover classification, 910 BCM of this rain falls on green cover including rainfed and irrigated agriculture lands, forests, and pasture lands, while 26 BCM of this rainfall drops onwater bodies, urban and barren lands.Out of the 910 BCM of rainfall on green cover, and as per the United States Geological Survey (USGS) satellite imagery for Evapotranspiration, about680 BCM is beneficially used and consumed as evapotranspiration from rainfed agriculture (107 BCM), irrigated agriculture (10 BCM), pasture (352 BCM), and forests (211 BCM). 29 BCM is evaporated from barren lands, urban areas and water bodies. 105 BCM contributes to aquifers as renewable groundwater. According to FAO, about 122 BCM of the 936 BCM of rainfall, contributes to surface water streams and rivers, where about 97 BCM exits the country through transboundary rivers and groundwater to neighboring countries; Egypt, Sudan, Eritrea, Kenya, Somalia, and Djibouti. The remaining 25 BCM of surface water contributes to internal lakes and streams within Ethiopia.

The above analysis indicates that out of the 936 BCM of annual rainfall on Ethiopia, the country benefits from 117 BCM in agriculture, 352 BCM in pasture lands (part of which contributes to livestock production), 211 BCM in forests for biodiversity, tourism and wood production, 105 BCM in renewable groundwater recharge, in addition to 25 BCM in surface water that stays inlakes and streams within the country. The remaining 126 BCM leaves the country through transboundary rivers (97 BCM) and upwards through evaporation losses (29 BCM). A small amount of this huge potential of renewable water resources is what sustains the Ethiopian population of more than 100 million people with domestic water, supplemental irrigation, and water for industrial uses and others. The rest of these renewable water resources are still there within the country on an annual basis to provide for future generations without compromising the 97 BCM of transboundary flows that is barely sustaining the existing populations of neighboring countries, especially Egypt.

According to watershed delineation analysis, the Nile River Basin, which is one of several river basins in Ethiopia, receives an average of 450 BCMof rainfall out of the 936 BCM of nationwide rainfall.

Comparing Ethiopia’s Per Capita Share of Renewable Water Resources to Egypt’s

Sustainable development is closely linked to availability of renewable freshwater resources. No matter how much a country invests in developing alternative and non-conventional resources, nothing can replace a natural sustainable renewable freshwater resource. Comparing renewable water resources available for Ethiopia versus Egypt, we see thatEthiopia receives an average of about 936 BCM/year of renewable rainfall. Subtracting evaporation losses and transboundary waters exiting the country, the remaining 810 BCM/year of renewable water resources, is available and contributes to rainfed agriculture, livestock production, surface water, and groundwater recharge (an important renewable source for domestic water and supplemental irrigation). This water is by far in excess of Ethiopia’s 100 million people water demand. On the other hand, Egypt is entitled to55.5 BCM/year from the Nile Basin waters for all its uses, including irrigated agriculture, domestic and industrial uses. If the small amount of sporadic rainfall of 1.5 BCM over Egypt is added to its Nile waters, Egypt’s renewable water resources sums up to 57 BCM/year. This water is reused and recycled several times to meet part of Egypt’s water demand for more than 100 million people. Egypt has to invest in agriculture drainage reuse, treated wastewater reuse, sea water desalination, and food imports in order to fill its water demand gap.

Egypt’s annual renewable water resources provides about 570 m3/person/year share of renewable water resources, which is below the water scarcity limit of 1000 cubic meter per person per year. On the other hand, Ethiopia’s renewable water resources provides about8100 m3/person/year share of renewable water resources.The vast difference in natural climatic conditions between upstream and downstream in the Nile Basin created thislarge difference between water abundance in Ethiopia and water scarcity in Egypt. Similar natural hydrological conditions created the transboundary Nile River originating in the Ethiopian Highlandsand the Equatorial Plateau upstream and running downstream through the deserts of Egypt. Egypt adapted to these harsh conditions and depended on the Nile River for years without problems. But what could create a problem,is when water abundant countries upstream attempt to infringe on downstream Egypt’s scarcewater resources.

Virtual Water tells more about the story of Ethiopia’s Water & Water Uses

On the demand side, the agriculture and livestock sector is the largest water consumptive sector. If we run a quick comparison on the “Virtual Water” (embedded water in products) in Ethiopia’s and Egypt’s imports, exports, and local production in that sector, a lot could be concluded on water resources availability and the state of the water in the two countries. The following analysis is based on waterfootprint.org data and FAO data on agriculture and livestock production, exports, and imports.

Egypt has to import a large amount of itsfood because of its water scarcity conditions. In 2012, right around when GERD construction seriously started, Egypt imported agriculture and meat products equivalent to about 48 BCM of ""Virtual Water"" at a cost of over$ 12 Billion. Ethiopia,with a similar population of about 100 million people like Egypt,imported in 2012 about5.7 BCM of Virtual Water in agriculture and meat products at a cost of $ 1.2 Billion, which is one tenth (1/10) of the cost of Egypt’s food imports. Onthe other hand, Ethiopia exported more than 6.4 BCM of virtual water in agriculture products and livestock, which was more than Egypt’s 5.2 BCMof agriculture & livestock virtual water exports for that same year. The value of these Ethiopian exports was around $ 2 billion which was double Egypt’s agriculture exports value of about $ 1 billion of that year.

The virtual water embedded in Ethiopia’s annual local agriculture and livestock production in 2012 was estimated to be about 124 BCM, mainly from direct rainfall contribution (green water). On the other hand, in Egypt, virtual water embedded in its local agriculture and livestock production in 2012 was estimated to be about 78 BCM mainly from irrigation water (blue water), reused water, and imported fodder.

You can’t have the cake and eat it too!!

Comparing virtual water in imports and local production between Egypt and Ethiopia, which is a reflection of each country’s water demand in that sector, we see that Egypt’s annual virtual water in agriculture and livestock amounts to 126 BCM, while Ethiopia’s annual virtual water in that sector amounts to about 129 BCM. Although the two countries seam to use almost the same amount of water to satisfy the needs of their similar size populations in that sector, however the difference is that Ethiopia provides 95% of this water from its available water resources (124 BCM), while Egypt could only provide37% of this water from itsavailable water resources (47 BCM) which is mainly originating in Ethiopia. Moreover, Egypt had to spend over $ 12 Billion to make available 38% of these water needsthrough imports and had to invest even more to make available the remaining 25% of these water needs through reuse of drainage and treated wastewater, groundwater development and imported fodder. And now, the 37% and most of the 25% of Egypt’s available water needs for agriculture and livestock are at risk by GERD, Ethiopia’s unilateral activities upstream the Nile, and continued Ethiopian messages on freedom to use the waters of the Nile River.

The above analysis reflects how Ethiopia’s water abundance allows it to grow its own food as opposed to Egypt, and even to export more virtual water than what Egypt could export to make available some of the necessary funds for importing lower value food products. Both countries have been surviving on varied dependencies on different types of waters; upstream Ethiopia depends more on Green Waterfrom direct rainfall, some of which is within the Nile basin, while downstream Egypt depends only on Blue Water from the Nile River itself. Moreover, a water scarce country like Egypt has to spend more money than an abundant water country like Ethiopia to provide for its food needs.

It's the power of nature that resulted invaried dependencies on green water in the basin for upstream versus blue water in the river itself for downstream. It would be unfair to have an abundant amount of green water, and still have an eye on the neighbors’ little amounts of blue water! “You can’t have the cake and eat it too!” Riparian countries within a shared River Basin should not ignore their own renewable ""Green Water"" and rainfed potential within the Basin, to fight over other countries’ ""Blue Water"" river’s existing uses, especially if it's their neighbor’s only piece of cake!

When Upstream Water Abundance switches to Water Hegemony

Given Ethiopia’s water abundance, its geographic location upstream of 85% of Egypt’s only renewable water resources, its unilateral decision to construct GERD on the main and largest tributary of the Nile, its continued attempts to deviate from concluding the GERD impact assessment studies, its procrastinating strategy in reaching an agreement on GERD filling and operating rules;all this suggests a different objective to the construction of GERD; a Water Hegemony Power rather than just Hydropower!

This is an increasingly relevant question given the pressures on water resources posed by population growth, climate change and changing lifestyles. This question is even more relevant in the Arab region, where water resources are scarce, public finances stretched and unemployment high. The Arab region is a global hotspot of unsustainable water use, with at least 30 percent of current water consumption exceeding sustainability limits. Fiscal challenges have also arisen, with overall fiscal balances (tax revenue and proceeds from assets sold minus spending) having deteriorated in the region since 2008. Finally, large and persistent levels of youth unemployment – hovering at about 25% for the past 25 years - present an urgent challenge for most Arab countries.

As the need to attract private investors to create jobs and move towards sustainable development becomes increasingly clear, we need to identify a new policy agenda that enables sustainable public and private sector investments in water.

Not enough financing

The water financing challenge is daunting. Despite enormous efforts, most Arab countries are not spending enough in water. And the issue is not just with the quantity of spending, but also with its quality. To address this shortfall, private capital and know-how need to be mobilized at an unprecedented scale. This is true for water, but also for other sectors. The region needs trillions of USD in quality investments of all kind to progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals.

Private finance is already playing an increasing role in responding to global environmental change. Through green bonds, for example, investors around the world are directing more and more resources to finance projects focused on climate resilience and environmental sustainability. The green bond market has seen an exponential growth in the last years, reaching $180 billion in 2019.

Ongoing innovation processes in financial products – tying them to environmental performance - seem to hold promise for improving the quantity and quality of water investments in the Arab region. In the last two years, sustainability-linked loans have emerged as a new instrument of sustainable finance. Contrary to green bonds, which tie funds to investments specifically targeted at climate resilience and sustainability, these loans tie interest rates to sustainability performance targets, including water conservation. Hence, an improvement in the borrower’s environmental performance as measured by specific performance indicators translates into lower borrowing costs. These mechanisms hold great potential, and are being adopted by large corporations, including water technology giant Xylem. Nonetheless, their scope and depth differ considerably, meaning that their application can be challenging in practice. Development finance is also increasingly used to support low-emission, climate resilient projects, however, the pool of climate finance available for water projects remains smalls compared to other flows of development-relevant finance. More can be done to mobilize financing for water-centered adaptation on the grounds that these investments build resilience while abating emissions, for instance through improved efficiency in water and energy use in irrigation.

Four foundations

While financial innovations can help harness private investment for sustainable development and food security, the benefits will only be reaped if the enabling policies are in place. This is the key message of “Towards a new generation of polices and investments in agricultural water in the Arab region: fertile ground for innovation”, a report we presented at the League of Arab States earlier this year. Prepared for the high-level ministerial meeting on agricultural water policies held on April 4th in Cairo, the report highlights four fundamental policy priorities that need to be pursued to leverage private and public finance and innovation for water sustainability. Unless these priorities are pursued, it will be difficult to build the necessary foundations for successful financing.

The first priority is to value water. Valuing water means protecting its quantity and quality, so that it can be allocated to the areas of highest social, environmental and economic value. Unless water’s value is properly recognized, we won’t be able to protect the human right to water, nor harness water’s productive potential to support the right to food. Cost recovery for irrigation is one way to value water, with several Arab countries having recently introduced water pricing in public irrigation schemes. Taking into consideration the lessons for past initiatives and new available technologies, further attempts can be made at involving the private sector in development, operations and maintenance of irrigation and drainage infrastructure. Measurement underpins valuation, so policies are needed to close the data gap, in particular, to enhance water accounting and modelling capabilities. With the global Valuing Water Initiative officially launched in 2019, now it’s the time to bring systemic change to the way water is valued.

Second, policy needs to accelerate the food system transformation. Water is at the heart of this transformation, with more reliable, transparent and sustainable management of this key resource required for agrifood sector development and higher value agriculture. Policies should aim at promoting climate-resilient agrifood value chains, reducing food loss and waste, building capacity, and fostering market competitiveness. This will help increase the productivity of competitive staple crops and crops with export potential. Technology has a key role to play here. Water saving agricultural technologies such as hydroponics can improve well-being, including nutritional status, for farmers and groups of people that are less integrated into the labor market, especially refugees. Achieving this transformation also means reassessing support policies for specific crops for which the region has no comparative advantage. Unless policy instruments that distort agricultural markets are replaced with more market-friendly support measures, it will not be possible to create supportive business environments for investment in modern, high value-added agriculture. Finally, the food system transformation hinges on improved governance of water resources, notably of groundwater, to address equity and sustainability issues between uses and users. This is perhaps the most challenging task, as existing state-centred groundwater governance models have not halted depletion, and successful cases of participatory and community-centred governance are rare too.

Third, digital technologies need to be put at the centre of agricultural water management. Digital is not just about IT infrastructure or mobile phones. It is rather an integrated set of opportunities leveraging technologies ranging from remote sensing to monitor evapotranspiration, the Internet of Things, and advanced analytics, through to farmer-centric services to guide irrigation applications and other water management. In the Gezira Irrigation Scheme in Sudan, geospatial analytics using remote sensing monitor crop water requirements and advise farmers through SMS on plant health and water needs. This led to yield increases of as much as 200% to 250%.

Finally, decisive action is needed to better target social protection measures. Cash transfers and social safety nets are instrumental to the region’s social cohesion and progress. Our report highlights that current policies focused on lowering consumer prices for specific food products have not contributed to the region’s agriculture competitiveness, and they have not helped tackling the region’s high rates of malnutrition and obesity. Targeted measures such as cash transfers, on the other hand, can empower individuals and reinforce social protection policies, while contributing to positive food security outcomes. As evaluations of Egypt’s first cash transfer program, Takaful and Karama, show, better targeting can make a positive difference in the lives of poor beneficiaries exposed to food price fluctuation.

Towards sustainable Arab agrifood systems

Since the earliest times, the Arab region’s spirit of agricultural enterprise has helped societies to thrive despite challenging environments. From the seventh to the eleventh century, this spirit radically transformed water management practices in a vast area, spanning present-day India all the way to Spain. This process not only affected agricultural production and incomes, but also urban growth, job markets and other spheres of life.

If the region’s spirit of agricultural enterprise is to survive and respond to today’s challenges, then local and global players must be willing to transform water management in food systems. This starts from sound policies, which will help mobilize much needed private finance and reduce existing inequalities and imbalances in access to water. This will help achieve the transformation of our food systems, the central theme of the recently announced UN Food Systems Summit in 2021, needed to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.

Prime Minister Mostafa Mabdouly directed the government to impose harsher penalties on those who waste water or steal water from public water pipes, according to a statement from the Cabinet on Thursday.

The meeting was attended by Minister of Water Resources and Irrigation Mohamed Abdel-Atti, Minister of Housing Utilities and Urban Communities Assem el-Gazzar, and Minister of Agriculture and Land Reclamation Sayyed El-Quseir.

""The prime minister ordered to install water-saving tap devices in all housing units, calling for expanding the establishment of desalination water plants in coastal cities and wastewater treatment plants,"" the statement said.

Despite the government's efforts to save every drop of water as the country faces water scarcity, 98.4 million Egyptians still live under the water poverty line by 50 percent, below the international line of 1,000 m3.

""Egypt suffers from an annual 21 billion cubic meters gap between water consumption and production. The consumption reached 110 billion cubic meters, while Egypt currently has 60 million cubic meters annually,"" announced Minister of Water Resources and Irrigation Mohamed Abdel Atti in October 2018.

""To mitigate water shortage, the government increased the number of sewage water treatment stations by 3.8 percent to rise to 432 in 2017/2018 from 416 stations in 2016/2017,"" the Central Agency for Public Mobilization and Statistics (CAPMAS) said in the annual bulletin in April 2019, adding that the quantity of water produced from such stations reached 4.6 billion m3 in 2018, comparing to 4.3 m3 in 2017

In 2019, Egypt announced the construction of the largest sewage water treatment plant to face water shortage that could affect around 0.5 million people in Sinai. The government’s efforts came amid Egypt’s concern over its Nile water share after Ethiopia has started building the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam on the Blue Nile since May 2011. The tributary of the Ethiopian Plateau feeds 80 percent of the Nile’s water to downstream states [Egypt and Sudan].

On July 21, a mini-summit between the leaders of the three countries was held under the brokerage of the African Union, to stress the need of reaching a binding legal agreement on the GERD’s filling and operation processes, which includes a legal mechanism serving as a reference to be used in case of any future disputes.","CAIRO - 23 July 2020: Amid its dispute with Ethiopia over the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (EGRD), Egypt is heading to toughen the penalties for water wastage in light of the county’s efforts to rationalize water consumption.

194,https://thearabweekly.com/nile-vital-source-water-turns-source-disease,"The Nile, a vital source of water, turns into source of disease","CAIRO - The Nile river, which me­anders from southern Egypt to the Mediterra­nean, has always been a lifeline for the country of almost 90 million people. It is, how­ever, becoming a source of death and disease.

Pollution is turning the Nile, which provides Egypt with almost all its water needs, into a scourge.

Around 4.5 million tons of pol­lutants, which include untreated or partially treated industrial waste, agricultural waste and sewage, flow into the Nile every year, according to the Egyptian Organisation for Human Rights.

Almost half of Egypt’s popula­tion drinks water either polluted or unfit for human consumption, the organisation said in a recent report.

“It gives me pain to say that we as a people do not have any respect for this great river,” water expert Ma­ghawri Diab said. “We have turned the river into a major basket for our trash.”

Egyptians use the Nile for almost every purpose. Apart from drinking and irrigating agricultural fields, they use the Nile to bathe, clean clothes, wash pots and dishes, dis­pose of rubbish and toss away dead donkeys, dogs and cows. Some canals across the Nile delta have turned into rubbish dumps, where residents from nearby villages throw unwanted things. The sight of an Egyptian throwing a pile of papers or food into the river is com­mon.

Hundreds of factories — some owned by the government — dis­charge waste, which often include dangerous chemicals, into the river. The residents of river islands also throw waste, including sewage and garbage, into the water.

Egypt now must deal with the ramifications of its neglect of the river. These consequences include a surge in terminal diseases, such as cancer and kidney failure.

“The links between water pol­lution and kidney failure and liver diseases are undisputable,” said Mohamed Fathi, an internal medi­cine specialist from Ain Shams Uni­versity. “Polluted water also causes cancer.”

Egyptians have to use a filter to make drinking water safer, usher­ing in a lucrative business for im­porters and manufacturers. More and more Egyptians abstain from drinking tap water or using it in cooking. Nevertheless, they are ex­posed to pollutants from the water when they eat vegetables sold in local markets, most of which were grown in fields irrigated with sew­age water or containing chemical residues.

Egypt, which receives 55 billion cubic metres of water from the riv­er every year, needs 74 billion cu­bic meters of water a year to meet the needs of its people. Diab says the country loses at least 15 billion cubic metres of water each year be­cause of pollution.

Other experts say pollution costs Egypt up to 6% of its national in­come through money spent on wa­ter purification and treating diseas­es caused by contaminated water.

According to environmental ex­pert Khaled al-Qadi, from Helwan University, 40% of the water and more than half the fish in the Nile are not fit for human consumption. The lack of official deterrence is one reason the Nile is so polluted. A person, factory or industrial or agricultural institution that throws waste into the river is fined no more than 200 Egyptian pounds — about $25.

Six government bodies, including the Irrigation Ministry and the Ag­riculture Ministry, are responsible for the protection of the Nile from pollution and other violations. All the agencies end up depending on each other and not doing anything, experts say.

“This is why it is important that only one agency becomes respon­sible for carrying out this job,” en­vironmental expert Ahmed Abdel Wahab said. “Water pollution is originally a problem of the lack of supervision and action.”

The government recently de­cided to take action against Nile violators. On September 7th, the Ministry of Environment said that it would close factories that dis­charge waste into the Nile after Oc­tober 31st. The ministry also said that it had summoned the heads of seven major sugar factories that discharge drainage into the Nile to discuss plans to end that pollution. However, experts such as Diab, who heads local non-governmental or­ganisation Nile Water Society, say the measures are far from enough.

“There can be no life in this coun­try without this river,” Diab said. “This is why we must do every­thing to protect it, from toughening penalties for violators to imposing strict supervision.”","CAIRO - The Nile river, which me­anders from southern Egypt to the Mediterra­nean, has always been a lifeline for the country of almost 90 million people.

When the most common diseases in Egypt are reported to be bacterial diarrhoea, typhoid fever, and schistosomiasis – which all have a connection to unsafe water and poor sanitation – then it is clear that the focus must shift towards one source: the Nile.

Since the times of the ancient Egyptians, the Nile has always formed the main water resource of Egypt, with more than 90% of the population living adjacent to or rely directly on the Nile and its delta.

However, with the country’s rapidly growing population, climate change and poor garbage and pollution management, the river has become disposed of contaminants that threaten the lives of many.

In 2017, former Minister of Environment Khaled Fahmy asserted that pollution in the Nile is still below danger levels in line with international standards, despite there being pollution spots and factories that discharge wastewater into the river.

Moreover, in the same year, head of the Ministry’s Central Department for Environment Monitoring Dr Mahmoud Allam noted that the number of direct polluting facilities has dropped from 102 to only nine, and that the problem now only comes from indirect pollution caused by wastewater treatment plants.

On the one hand, according to an overview of the water quality assessment of the Nile, the pollutants discharged into the Nile are often strongly diluted, and as such, mid-stream conditions are still seen to be at a fairly clean level. In most examined samples, for instance, residues of organo-chlorine pesticides were detected at levels below the limit set by the World Health Organisation for use as drinking water.

Nevertheless, it is important to point out the parameters used for measurement are often limited and that many areas may contain a higher concentration of pollutants than others, such as Lake Maryut and Lake Manzala, which receive a high number of pollutants from agricultural drainage.

“Reports about water pollution are not correct,” Health Minister Hatem el-Gabali once told IRIN, as other studies dismissed by the government have revealed high levels of toxins that surpassed international standards.

In cities where industrial activities are concentrated, such as Cairo and Alexandra, industrial wastewater contributes most pollutants to the river, ranging from chemical industries, to textile, spinning, steel and mining industries.

According to one assessment, lead and cadmium were detected in finished drinking water of four treatment plants in greater Cairo between 1993 and 1994, with levels of 29.6µg l −1 for lead and 4.15µg l −1 for cadmium, yet another one found the concentrations 14 and 24 times greater.

Drainage water seeping from agriculture fields is also a major source of pollution, receiving large parts of salts, nutrients, pesticide residues, pathogens and toxic organic and inorganic pollutants. El-Kabbany found in his article the presence of 16 organochlorine pesticides in most of the water samples, and El Gendy concluded that residues of organochlorine insecticides and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were highly concentrated at Kafr El Zayat city and the Rosetta branch.

Another important source of pollution is plastic, as a recent study by the World Economic Forum showed that most of the plastic that goes into the oceans starts in rivers. Of the 10 rivers where 90% of the plastic comes from, eight of them are in Asia, while the two other rivers are in Africa: the Nile and the Niger.

“VERYNILE” INITIATIVE BY BASSITA

Bassita, an Egyptian startup that specialises in social media campaigning, launched an initiative this year called “VeryNile” to drive the largest cleanup means of large-scale and efficient removal of plastic pollution from aquatic ecosystems.

They partner with fishermen to collect trash on a daily basis and provide them with extra revenue for every kilo of trash they remove from the river. They also regularly organise awareness events and online campaigns to promote the protection of rivers and oceans.

The aim of VeryNile’s first event on December 15th is to join a coalition of partners willing to take drastic measures to save the environment: 200 volunteers from more than 20 organisations including governmental entities, NGOs, private sector, and the media to raise awareness about pollution of the Nile.

“How are we going to get rid of all of that plastic? VeryNile’s mission is to create highly efficient removing tools such as floating dams or cleaning robots. But all that would be useless if we don’t stop throwing plastic everywhere,” says Salem Massalha, co-founder of Bassita.

Malawi is a landlocked country in the Southern region of Africa. It is the smallest but most densely populated country in the region with a population of roughly 18 million, growing by nearly 5 million in the past decade. Currently, 1 in 10 people don’t have access to clean water because of a series of droughts, flooding and population growth.

In 2015, Malawi experienced some of the worst flooding in decades, which destroyed the homes and crops of communities. Today the country is still experiencing episodes of heavy flooding. This not only depletes crops affecting food supplies, but also directly contaminates water sources that are heavily relied on. When flooding occurs, the water flow picks up organic and industrial matter and carries it into unprotected water supply sources, increasing the risk of water-borne diseases. Bacteria, parasites and toxic chemicals create massive health risks but with limited sources available, communities will often have no choice but to use contaminated water.

Flooding can also result in displacement of communities; when families lose their homes, livestock and crops in floods they are often forced to relocate. This puts a further strain on already limited water sources in the relocation areas due to the greater demand. Severe flooding and droughts are destroying the country’s food security, economy, opportunity and overall health of the population.

Drop4Drop are currently working to set up clean water projects across Malawi; to give hope to communities and help prevent the spread of water-borne diseases.

In Malawi, 80% of the population has access to an improved source of drinking water, but that leaves about 4 million people who still lack access to safe water. Additionally, only six percent of the population has access to an improved sanitation facility. Poor sanitation practices and improper storage of drinking water commonly lead to waterborne illnesses such as cholera.

199,https://borgenproject.org/water-quality-in-malawi/,Five Things You Need to Know About Water Quality in Malawi,"Clean water is something that is often taken for granted, but certainly not in Malawi. In the last two years, UNICEF helped nearly 50,000 people gain access to improved water supply and produced 500 water points, with the new goal to serve an additional 125,000 people with safe water in 2016. Though overall water quality in Malawi has improved significantly, there is still so much more that can be done.

Many water hand pumps are inoperative, leaving people with no choice but to go back to unsafe water sources. Poor sanitation practices and improper storage of drinking water often lead to waterborne illnesses like cholera. WaterAid is one organization making a difference and supporting the marginalized communities of Malawi by repairing broken wells and handpumps. Showing users how to maintain their own facilities ensures that safe water will be available close to homes year round. The lack of access to safe water in Malawi has taken a toll on cultivation and increased hunger. A steady water supply is essential to growing enough food to eat, but the extreme weather and pollution where the majority of people in Malawi live make farming difficult. In addition to wells and handpumps, WaterAid also builds simple composting latrines, which help keep water sources clean and provide fertilizer for crops. According to the USAID Fact Sheet, approximately 4 million people still lack access to safe water. Likewise, 10 million people lack access to adequate sanitation in Malawi. Clean water is essential for a healthy population. Clean Water for Malawi (CWFM) works to provide this basic necessity by drilling water wells in small villages. CWFM has built 402 wells in Malawi since 2010, with each well supplying enough clean water for up to 350 – 500 people. Lack of access to clean water causes disease and death in Malawi. Approximately 30,000 people die every year in Malawi from issues caused by dirty water, namely diarrhea, dysentery, parasitic infections and food and water-borne illnesses. Studies show that schools that do not have working toilets or water discourage children from attending and completing their education. In 2007, UNICEF fixed 39 school water points, bringing safe water to 23,000 school children. Public communication strategies regarding hygiene promotion also help to educate individuals in Malawi on the proper use and safe handling of water and sanitation facilities.

With poor water quality in Malawi having such a heavy impact on the lives of locals, organizations like UNICEF, WaterAid and USAID are applauded for their generous contributions.

Making the issue a priority and taking direct action has saved thousands of lives and is hopefully a mindset that will carry on to further improve conditions in Malawi.

To be truly resilient, both infrastructure and communities need to be able to withstand shocks and natural disasters. Kunja village not only has a water pump that can keep working through droughts, it also has an engaged community that understands the value of safe water, and is dedicated to protecting it.

A committee comprised of representatives from local villages raises money to pay tap attendants and pump operators, and to make basic repairs. They are currently in the process of holding a fundraiser to plant a garden in the village – fed by the pump – so they can sell produce to make money for major repairs.

Perhaps this sense of pride and ownership is not surprising. The solar pump has transformed life in this remote community. The number of children at Namera Primary School has increased from 300 to 449 as a direct result of the pump.

“The learners have water to drink and to wash their hands after using the toilet,” Headmaster Kapalamula says. “Our school grades have improved because of better attendance. We’re attracting better teachers and they stay for longer. Our school has become a desirable place to work, because of the pump.”

For families like Lucy’s the change has been even more profound. She hasn’t been sick once since the solar pump was installed. “It feels so good not to be ill,” she says. “And I don’t have to walk to the next village to get water. I’m doing much better in school. I would like to go on to secondary school and become a doctor to help my fellow Malawians.”

With continued access to safe water, Lucy has every chance of making her dream a reality.","Resilient communitiesTo be truly resilient, both infrastructure and communities need to be able to withstand shocks and natural disasters.

Poor quality water can have serious health implications including: the increased prevalence of water-borne diseases such as cholera, typhoid, and dysentery; higher rates of child mortality; and greater chance of infection amongst mothers and newborns. Many other water-related diseases such as scabies, flea, lice and tick-borne diseases, as well as mosquito-borne diseases such as dengue, malaria, yellow fever and onchocerciasis occur in the absence of proper water and sanitation facilities. These negative health impacts only compound the problems of poverty facing Malawi today.

While Malawi has significant groundwater resources, they are not easily accessible to rural populations that lack adequate infrastructure. More than 79% of Malawi’s population live in rural areas[1], and, while 92% of urban residents have access to improved water sources, more than 23% of rural inhabitants rely on unsafe water sources such as shallow hand-dug wells and surface water bodies.[2]","IMPLICATIONSPoor quality water can have serious health implications including: the increased prevalence of water-borne diseases such as cholera, typhoid, and dysentery; higher rates of child mortality; and greater chance of infection amongst mothers and newborns.

As government and its partners continue to prioritize the provision of portable, clean and safe drinking water to all as per the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the private sector is also playing a key role in the promotion of water treatment products as a way of ensuring clean water and sanitation to households in Malawi.

With support from the Malawi Innovation Challenge Fund (MICF), Arkay Plastics Limited and its partner, SAFI Water Treatment Solutions, started manufacturing locally a Household Water Treatment and Storage Unit that aims at providing a simple yet effective point of use solution to the challenges of poor quality drinking water that plagues many parts of the country.

Studies indicate that consistent use of Household Water Treatment Systems (HWTS) products and practices reduce the risk of contracting water borne diseases, e.g. diarrhea, by as much as 50%. Yet, despite the compelling benefits for personal health, approximately 67% of Malawian households do not treat their drinking water adequately (10.7 million people). The Water Treatment and Storage Unit, which is a first of its kind to be produced in the country aims to target and provide access to clean and portable water to 50,000 households across Malawi.

The water treatment and storage units are deemed being an important step for MICF in support of the country’s private sector development and poverty alleviation.

The new product has been a clear indication of Malawian firms’ ability to develop new innovate ideas and carry the associated risks whilst ensuring the inclusive nature of the project by involving female entrepreneurs as part of its marketing and sales program.

The product targets households in semi urban and rural Malawi who do not have access to a regular water supply and in-house connections. The project has targeted retail customers in the urban and semi urban areas of the country who are willing to procure a high quality, affordable water treatment product and vulnerable groups such as mothers, HIV/AIDS patients, school going pupils and other groups that are assisted through NGO and governmental health programs.

Arkay Plastics and its partner SAFI, have positioned the Water Filter devices as an attractive commodity to the local households by making it relatively inexpensive to purchase at a price point which is 60% lower than the price for similar imported filters, making it affordable for low income families.

To further ensure that the Water Treatment and Storage Units are marketed effectively, Arkay and SAFI have trained frontline staff handling the sales and have also engaged specialized sales agents to help identify the right channels of distribution of the product to the masses.

The project which commenced implementation in January 2015 and is expected to be completed by end 2017, is expected to create 51 new jobs and will also address behavioral change in water, hygiene and sanitation among its target customers for long term sustainability.

Arkay Plastics is one the 19 private sector firms currently leading the implementation of various agribusiness, manufacturing and logistics projects with support from MICF, aimed at strengthening the private sector’s ability to serve as the engine of economic growth.

MICF is a competitive, transparent mechanism that provides grant finance for innovative projects and inclusive business models proposed by the private sector active in Malawi’s agricultural, manufacturing and logistics sectors. It is supported by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the Department for International Development (UKAid), the German Development Bank (KfW) and the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD).

Watersheds are being degraded, leading to reduced water availability, deterioration of water quality, increased vulnerability to droughts and floods, reduced energy security and declining agricultural productivity”. The World Bank has thus drawn up the report, underscoring the importance of a project for which it has just approved a $157 million loan via its subsidiary, the International Development Association (IDA).

The Malawi Watershed Services Improvement Project (MWASIP) is initiated by the Government of Malawi with the aim of adopting sustainable landscape management practices in priority watersheds and improving rural livelihoods. The project is the first in a series of operations to support the implementation of the National Forest Landscape Restoration Strategy in Malawi.

Restoring 4.5 million hectares of degraded land by 2030

“We have committed in our strategy to restore 4.5 million hectares of degraded land by 2030, and this project is the first opportunity we need to use to reverse landscape degradation and protect our watersheds,” says Henrie Njoloma, Malawi’s Secretary for Irrigation and Water Development.

To achieve these goals, the Government of Malawi, through the World Bank loan, will allocate $40 million to improve the livelihoods of more than 250,000 people through various community grant programmes designed to encourage better land management. The Malawi Watershed Services Improvement Project (MWASIP) will also develop 38 multi-purpose water sources, including 10 small dams, 20 rainwater harvesting structures, eight high-yield boreholes and more.

The Malawian authorities will upgrade water transport infrastructure for 42,000 people. Funds allocated by the World Bank through IDA will be used to build 10 small and medium irrigation systems for 2,400 hectares of cultivated land, benefiting about 5,000 farmers.

According to the World Bank, the project will help strengthen institutional capacity in watershed management to support interventions beyond the project. The Malawi Watershed Services Improvement Project builds on the success of another World Bank-supported project, the Shire River Basin Management Project, which the Government of Malawi is implementing from 2012 to 2019.

To this end, the country signed a financing agreement with Exim Bank of India on June 12, 2020, for the realisation of several water supply projects. The Indian bank thus decided to open a line of credit of 215.68 million dollars, the equivalent of more than 158.45 billion Malawian kwachas, to ensure the financing of all the projects.

Drinking water supply projects

Among the drinking water projects benefiting from the Indian bank’s line of credit is the construction of a new water supply system from the Likhubula River in Mulanje, southern Malawi, to supply the regional capital Blantyre. In this city in particular, it is planned to set up and extend the water supply system in the areas under the authority of the Blantyre Water Board. The construction of the associated infrastructures, as well as the installation of a 30 MW solar power plant for pumping water, are also included in the Malawian government’s specifications.

“This agreement with Exim Bank of India is very timely. Currently, Blantyre and Zomba, two growing cities, are facing many challenges in providing clean drinking water,” says George Mkondiwa, Malawi’s ambassador to India. “Once fully implemented, the projects will help address the increasing shortage of safe drinking water in Blantyre and Zomba and surrounding areas,” he added.

The concessional loan from Exim Bank of India will also provide an irrigation network for farmers in the southern region of Malawi.

Both countries want to develop the basin of this watercourse as a natural boundary. To this end, a joint commission was recently launched in Kyela District, Mbeya region (Tanzania) by Joseph Mwanamvekha, Malawi’s Minister of Agriculture, Irrigation and Water, and Jumaa Aweso, Tanzania’s Deputy Minister of Water and Irrigation. The body aims to facilitate investment in development projects around the Songwe River.

The 472 km long Songwe River originates in Poroto-Berge, Tanzania, zigzags between the two borders before flowing into Lake Malawi. “The objective of the commission is to supervise the management of the river basin resources for the benefit of the populations of the two neighbouring countries,” according to the Tanzanian and Malawian authorities.

Expected hydraulic projects!

The new commission is being formed as the two countries are already working together on the 180 MW Songwe hydroelectric project. The dam and power plant will be located south of the town of Itumba, 120 km from Mbeya. The feasibility study of the project, financed by the African Development Bank (AfDB), has been carried out since 2015. The Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) has also been completed since 2017.

The project requires a $829 million investment to complete. Tanzania and Malawi, seeking financing, have already obtained the AfDB’s agreement to invest in this project. The energy produced will be equally divided (90 MW) between Tanzania Electric Supply Company Limited (Tanesco) and Zambia Electricity Supply Corporation Limited, the two companies that provide public electricity services in the two respective countries.

In addition to this hydroelectric project, the Tanzania-Malawi Joint Commission on Songwe River Basin Management is developing an irrigation project. The initiative covers 6,000 hectares of plantations on both sides of the border. Irrigation water will be pumped from the Songwe Dam.

In East Africa, the joint initiative of countries for the development of watercourses is an attractive practice. This is evidenced by the recent collaboration between Zimbabwe and Zambia in the construction of the Batoka Gorge Dam on the Zambezi River. The project is led by the Zambezi River Authority (ZRA), an organisation owned by both states. The future Batoka Gorge hydroelectric power plant will provide 2,400 MW divided equally between Zimbabwe and Zambia.

For years, wood charcoal burners had been destroying this forest, the catchment basin for the Lilongwe River, the source of the capital’s water. Fewer trees mean the ground is less able to absorb water in the rainy season and gradually surrender it the rest of the year.

The stars around it are as uncountable as the grains of sand bordering Lake Malawi, 60 miles away. Far below Orion’s shimmer, a rooster crows — an alarm clock with feathers, strutting through the darkness past a row of huts where adults and children yearn for a few more hours of rest.

Eight-year-old Ireen is fast asleep in her grandmother’s one-room hut. Next door in her mother’s house, her sister, Jekina, 4, stirs as the rooster continues the hullabaloo, no snooze button to silence him.

The girls’ mother, Happiness — Chimwemwe in her native tongue of Chichewa — wakes in the dark to make her first walk of the day to collect water under the night sky. She ties her 1-month-old baby, Secret, securely to her back with a colorful piece of cloth, then walks with her twin sister, Gift, in single file from their huts to a stream where as many as a thousand people will collect water and wash clothes from morning until night. Although it is dark, the 26-year-olds don’t need a flashlight. They know this path. They have been walking its treacherous terrain since they were 4.

Their family lives in the Great Rift Valley, the geological marvel that stretches nearly 4,000 miles from Lebanon’s Bekaa Valley in the Middle East to Mozambique in southeastern Africa. The valley, actually a series of adjoining trenches, is the result of a rift: a fracture in the earth that continues to tear open the crust, causing chunks of earth to sink and molten rock to rise in the form of volcanic eruptions. The stream where the family collects water is within the Great Rift. The hills are rocky, the valleys slippery, and the changes in elevation make for a grueling and potentially dangerous climb — especially carrying a heavy bucket of water on your head in temperatures swelling over 90 degrees, your neck and calves aching, sweat trickling into your eyes and momentarily blinding you.

The stars above the path are dizzyingly spectacular, but their magnificence is lost on Happiness. The single mother worries about her house — at only 12 feet across, it’s too small for all four of her children. She worries about leaving Jekina alone every morning — what if someone tries to abduct her? She worries about feeding her son, Beauty, who is staying with his father, her ex-husband, tonight — the growing 11-year-old is always hungry, and there’s only one bag of maize left. She worries about Secret, adorable but fussy. And she worries about Ireen, the daughter who reminds her so much of herself — smart and feisty. How can Ireen reach for the stars in a place where food and water are unreachable?

In the Great Rift Valley region of Malawi, poverty and the lack of clean water create fractures that cut through society — producing rifts in families and communities, and hardships for girls like Ireen.

Rifts in children’s lives

When Happiness returns with the day’s first supply of water, she is relieved to find Jekina still safely asleep in her small, round mud house. As the sun rises with a resolve that foretells another hot day, Ireen emerges from her grandmother’s hut. “I wake up happy,” she says, her joy taking the form of a brilliant smile. Ireen’s energy pulsates. Now that it’s daylight, it’s her turn to go for water.

Last year, Ireen asked her mother if she could start gathering water. She saw the weight her mother was carrying, pregnant with her fourth baby, struggling to feed and clothe her children. “I told her she was too young,” says Happiness. “Ireen insisted.” Although it’s a task she volunteered for, it’s not one Ireen enjoys. “It makes my neck hurt,” she says. But for girls in Malawi, carrying water is a rite of passage. “These kids have a heart to work on their own,” says Happiness. “Getting their own water shows independence — that they don’t need their mother to do it.”

Barefoot, Ireen can balance 20 pounds of water on her head, trying with all her might not to trip and fall. Injury is just one fear. The other is breaking the red plastic bucket. As her mother has warned her on many occasions, there’s no money for another. For us, it would be like wrecking the family car.

Ireen will walk for water up to three times a day, unless she helps with laundry. Then, she will go four times. Throughout the course of their daily water-collecting journeys, Ireen and her mother will walk about 6 kilometers, or 3.7 miles, the average distance women and children in the developing world walk every day for water. It’s best for Ireen to go before it gets too hot — plus, school starts at 7:30. She can’t be late.

“She’s my favorite,” says Ireen’s teacher, 30-year-old Timale Chisutu. “She is quick to respond. She is not shy when she knows the answer.” Ireen ranks ninth in a class of 157 students, a remarkable feat given her circumstances. “I know how she lives,” says Ireen’s teacher. “She comes from a very poor family. I can tell by her clothes, her uniform, books, pencils, and her body. Sometimes she is very dirty.”

Although Ireen comes to school without having washed, there are times that diarrhea, a result of drinking unsafe water, keeps her away. Diarrhea is a serious issue for the community, says Fenless Chimutu, 34, the nurse and midwife in charge of the local health clinic where Happiness gave birth to Secret. “One of every five patients has loose stools or diarrhea,” she says. “You see it more in young children.” The nurse, who’s been at the clinic for five “tough and difficult” years, sees hundreds of patients every day. “If there was clean water, that number would be reduced to less than half.”

Ireen’s community has never had a borehole well. A neighboring community’s borehole is near her school, and while her community isn’t allowed to draw from it, the children can use it while they’re in class. Ireen prefers the borehole water to what she gets from the stream near her house — she knows the borehole water is clean and the water from the stream is not. “It makes me afraid,” she says. “I’m afraid of the water because I know that worms are going into my body.” Usually bright, Ireen’s countenance darkens. At school, her teacher notices Ireen’s tension and says, “Sometimes she looks anxious.”

Playing helps ease that anxiety, if only temporarily. Ireen and her friends play games like Mira, a game that takes dodgeball to new heights. They attempt to build a tower of rocks while avoiding being hit by a ball made of rags. And there’s Champi — a long jump game played with three sticks that are moved apart to make it harder to jump over them. The only problem with playing games: Ireen gets thirsty. In fact, she says, she is thirsty all the time.

Rifts in families

Growing up in poverty and without a father, Ireen is experiencing a childhood similar to her mother’s. Happiness and her twin never knew their father; he died before they could form any memories of him. They’re not even sure where he is buried. The twins began to carry water when they were young. “We would go one way and then come back tired,” says Happiness. “The next day, we would go back. We started with cooking pots. Then our containers got larger.”

We didn’t have time to play. It was tough for us as children. We were always tired. —Happiness, mother of Ireen

School was a much-needed, much-loved respite for the twins. “I was good at Chichewa,” says Happiness. “I was always the highest in the class. Gift was always in the top five, too.” But, like so many girls in Africa, their thirst for education was dampened by their family’s daily need for water. “We did not enjoy our childhood,” says Happiness. “We would wake up in the morning, go get water, and go to school. Then we would go straight to get water. We didn’t have time to play. It was tough for us as children. We were always tired.” When they were about Ireen’s age, their uniforms finally became too ragged to repair, and they dropped out.

The two girls began working in other people’s fields all day, getting paid in maize — about 10 pounds for four days’ work. They’d also earn a few kwacha — the national currency — by carrying water and making charcoal to sell. Their daily grind was interrupted by a visit from Samuel, the man who would become Ireen’s father.

Samuel’s proposal was no scene from a romance novel. “He said, ‘Is there a woman I could marry in your family?’” recalls Happiness, who was a teenager. “They [her mother and Samuel’s family]made arrangements, and then we got married.” As a dowry — the exchange of money or property for a bride still commonly practiced in many parts of the world — Samuel gave the village chief a chicken in return for Happiness’ hand in marriage and gave her mother 20,000 kwacha (about $27). Happiness moved to Samuel’s village to start her new life, which eventually included giving birth to their children, Beauty, Ireen, and Jekina.

Happiness hoped that Samuel would take care of her, but instead he became jealous. “When I went to get water, he would think I was out meeting other men,” she says. “He would be mad and beat me up.” Just as water played a role in Happiness’ dropping out of school, now it was threatening her marriage. “It was really an issue, not just for our marriage but for everything,” she says. “Women have to spend so much time getting water that we can’t focus on other things, like our families.”

Happiness finally shared about her troubled marriage with her mother and moved back home. She remarried a year later and became pregnant with baby Secret, but after an argument about money, “He took his things and left,” says Happiness. Life wasn’t much better for Gift, who is now divorced, having experienced the same issues as her sister — fights about money and the issues that come with not having clean water nearby.

The hardest part about staying here is being hungry. —Beauty, brother of Ireen

The family is fractured, just like the land on which they live. Beauty bounces between Happiness’ and his father’s homes. He likes staying with his mother, but it comes at a cost. “The hardest part about staying here is being hungry,” he says. “It’s different at my father’s. At my father’s, I get to eat.” But at his father’s house, he doesn’t feel loved. “There, I don’t get school supplies or support.”

The girls don’t visit their father. “The girls don’t want to go,” says Happiness. “When they go, they don’t get love, care, or support from their father.”

Rifts in communities

Just as it divides families, the lack of water creates rifts within communities. In Malawi and around the world, the lack of sufficient water leads to fights at water sources, according to a U.S. Agency for International Development brief. The thought of Ireen becoming involved in a physical altercation frightens Happiness. “I fear that she will have to fight her way for the water,” she says. It’s not an idle fear; she’s seen it happen to others.

“Sometimes you’ve waited, and people just cut in line,” she says. That’s when the punching begins. In a neighboring community where water is similarly limited, the chief instituted a one-bucket rule. “Filling too many buckets delays everything,” says M’mangepo Baifoti, 47, who goes to church with Happiness. But one day, a woman brought three buckets to fill. She wanted to wash clothes so her family was fresh and clean for church. “People got mad and threw buckets at each other,” says M’mangepo.

“It was bad,” says Phillipo Mankhanibo, 41, the chief of that village. “There was fighting and there was blood. They broke each other’s buckets. They had to go to the hospital.” He fined two women a chicken. “It’s a big fine,” says Marriata Dzimbiri, 25, another church member. “A chicken costs 3,000 kwacha (US$4) in town. It’s hard to pay that.”

The chief settles a lot of disputes over water. “The area is so big that there’s a lot of water-related conflict — most of it, in fact.” And if there were clean water? He sighs. “My life would be much easier.”

The chief of Ireen’s village could no longer support himself there and had to move to another village for work. “He was a good chief,” says Happiness. Now, she says, a lot of conflicts occur between neighbors that only a chief can solve. “If our chief comes back, families will be more stable,” she says. Stability that could lead to less hunger. Many families are eating one — maybe two — meals a day. Ireen and her cousins try to help their family, spending some afternoons chasing down mice and giving them to an aunt, to boil and remove the insides before selling them on sticks at the market for 50 kwacha each, about 70 cents.

Mending the rifts

The rifts around Ireen may seem insurmountable. In fact, Malawi ranks as one of the world’s poorest countries, behind Burundi, the Central African Republic, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, according to the International Monetary Fund.

But a group of strong women among World Vision’s local staff are committed to repairing them. Mereena Mhone John, 41, manages child sponsorship in Ireen’s community with empathy and vision for lasting change. She’s well prepared for the work, holding degrees in arts and humanities, development, and a master’s in leadership and change from universities in Malawi, South Africa, and the United Kingdom.

Mereena has witnessed the changes child sponsorship brings. “Children are encouraged to go to school and learn how to read, write, and attain skills that will help them when they grow up,” she says. They also participate in programs around health, water, education, and spiritual nurture. And, just as importantly, says Mereena, they’re encouraged to communicate with their sponsors through letters.

The letters the children receive from their sponsors become treasures. “They know that someone out there loves them,” says Mereena.

She’s also seen how the impact of sponsorship reaches beyond the friendship between children and sponsors. “Parents also benefit from sponsorship because there is a relationship, which is built between the sponsor and the whole family,” she explains. And through economic empowerment programs funded by sponsorship, parents get support to start small businesses and establish better household finances. The increased income means they’re able to send their kids to school, put nutritious food on the table, and provide choices for the future.

God created water and when we are drilling, we make a deliberate effort to seek guidance from that same God to provide water. —Liddah, World Vision technical advisor

One of the most immediate impacts sponsorship can have on kids’ health and overall well-being is funding borehole wells and water systems. Once a community has easy access to clean, safe water, they no longer suffer from water-related diseases like diarrhea and cholera — and women and girls are no longer trapped in the cycle of walking for water.

Working alongside Mereena to bring that reality to Ireen’s community is Liddah Manyozo, 37, a World Vision technical advisor to a team of drillers who are charged with bringing water to communities across Malawi.

“My hope for Ireen is that one day she will have a borehole in her village with safe water,” says Liddah, who also carried water as a girl — “it was a part of life,” she remembers. For Liddah, who holds a bachelor of science in agriculture with an emphasis on nutrition, finding clean water is not just a technical exercise, but a spiritual one. “God created water,” she says, “and when we are drilling, we make a deliberate effort to seek guidance from that same God to provide water.”

Rounding out the team of strong women in Ireen’s life is Irene Chongwe, 33, a World Vision staff member who teaches families how to stay clean and healthy through sanitation and hygiene practices. Irene started carrying water for her family at the age of 10, when her mother died. Although she moved from home to home after her mother’s death, she clung tenaciously to the chance for an education, eventually earning an advanced diploma in community development from Malawi Polytechnic. As an expert in sanitation and hygiene, Irene has her work cut out for her: Only 50% of the families in this community have latrines and hand-washing stations.

World Vision staff play a special role in the lives of the children they serve, and Mereena knows it’s particularly important for them to see women in leadership. “We are like role models to Ireen,” says Mereena. “She can have hope that she can make it.”

Together, the three women, World Vision staff, and community members are working diligently to empower Ireen and other children like her to become change-makers. “World Vision focuses on children. Children are the future of this country,” Mereena says. “So working with children, I know I am contributing to the development of this country.”

Hope in the Great Rift Valley

It’s evening in the village. Gift’s sons are crab-walking in the dirt. Jekina is dancing to music of her own making, and Ireen is playing with her friends. Beauty is at his father’s house; otherwise, he’d join in the fun.

Things have taken a positive turn: Happiness has called the chief and told him that World Vision has come. “They want to meet with him,” she says with a smile, holding Secret in her arms. “He’ll be here on Tuesday.” Working with the chief — even if he has moved away — is crucial to ensure that any progress made is lasting.

The idea of a borehole in the community is exhilarating. “It would bring so much change in my life and the community,” says Happiness. “It would mean the end of walking for water. We would be able to rest. We would be able to work in the garden. My children could play and do their schoolwork.”

She’s equally intrigued by the idea of child sponsorship, especially for Ireen. “By being in the program, it would help Ireen know that she is remembered,” she says. “It would help her work harder in school and have a better future.”

A gentle breeze blows through the palm trees and the clouds turn the color of roses as the sun fades. Orion will soon appear. The rooster struts by, preparing for tomorrow. He needs to be ready. Morning comes early in the Great Rift Valley.

The Integrated Urban Water and Sanitation Project for Mzimba Town project, co-financed by the OPEC Fund for International Development and the Malawian Government, won the award in the ‘governments and social foundations’ category.

“This prestigious award is especially relevant to current global efforts to contain the COVID-19 pandemic and the urgent need for enhanced hygiene practices,” said Dr. Akinwumi A. Adesina, President of the African Development Bank Group.

“I applaud the recognition of this project by the Prize Committee of the Prince Talal International Prize for Human Development. The recognition is timely given that the project is rapidly expanding access to water supply and sanitation to communities, while promoting good hygiene practices such as hand washing with soap. Hand washing is one of the most effective ways to reduce the spread of COVID-19,” Dr. Adesina said.

The Arab Gulf Program for Development’s Prize Committee announced the winners in the water and sanitation services category for 2019 at a virtual meeting last week.

The prize money of $200,000 will go to a project implemented by government agencies, public institutions or social businesses approved by the Mzimba Town scheme.

The African Development Bank co-financed and supervised the Mzimba Town project, with significant funding from the OPEC Fund. Malawi’s Northern Region Water Board implemented the project.

The major works were completed 12 months ahead of the December 2020 completion date. It has increased the community’s access to potable water from 65% to 95%, raised access to improved sanitation from 45% to 97% and created around 1,000 jobs.

Components of the project, including a community-led ‘Total Sanitation’ initiative, have helped to reduce diarrheal cases from 35% to 3%. Some 10 potable water kiosks were established in nearby rural villages, helping to curb attacks on women trekking for water, often at night.

“We used to collect drinking water from streams that were a two-hour walk away. It was unsafe and contributed to waterborne diseases,” said Maggie Hunga, Vice Chairperson of the Hunga Communal Water Point.

It has also safeguarded the education and security of young girls who no longer need to fetch water before school, she added.

The construction of primary school sanitation facilities, including secured toilets as part of the project, has provided privacy and comfort to the pupils, especially girls. At Mzimba Prison, authorities have reported a reduction in skin diseases due to potable water supply and improved hygiene practices.

“We had a system that was on its knees…now we provide access to potable water to 95% of our customers, 22 hours a day,” said Engineer Tutus Mtegha, CEO of the Northern Region Water Board.","An African Development Bank-financed and supervised water and sanitation project, now helping to curb the spread of COVID-19 in Malawi, has won the prestigious Prince Talal International Prize for Human Development.

Mercy Phiri, a 50-year-old mother from Matola-Kampaliro Village in Traditional Authority (T/A) Kaluluma in Kasungu, has serious reservations with government’s pace to achieve sixth United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG).

SDG 6 seeks governments’ commitment to provide universal access to safe and affordable drinking water as well as universal access to improved sanitation by 2030.

To demonstrate its commitment, Malawi has signed a number of international agreements relating to water, sanitation and hygiene (Wash) issues, most prominently being the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

Furthermore, Malawi is a signatory to the 2008 eThekwini Declaration and the Ngor Declaration, which was adopted in 2014.

However, the snail’s pace and lukewarm approach on Wash issues that the Malawi Government has taken demonstrates lack of seriousness on the part of authorities to achieve the goals by the set deadlines as the majority of Malawians continue to rely on rivers and streams as their source of water for domestic use.

Unicef estimates that lack of access to clean and safe drinking water causes waterborne illnesses that claim lives of more than 1.6 million young children each year.

The situation is even worse in cities and towns where because the sewer system is completely overburdened, ground water is contaminated – and so are the wells that many more people depend on.

And this is the main reason why water-borne diseases are common. The plain truth is that universal access to safe water is impossible without universal access to sanitation.

African leaders, including President Peter Mutharika, acknowledge that sanitation is not getting the attention it deserves.

Environmental journalist Raphael Mweninguwe says Malawi, a landlocked country with a population of over 17 million people, still has a long way to go – and depends on money that donors are channeling through civil society organisations because they worry about government corruption.

But in the midst of this uncertainty and hopelessness, Brighton Kaniki, a 42-year-old entrepreneur behind Zaluso Plumbing and Engineering Works in Kasungu, is assisting government to achieve universal access to water and improved sanitation by providing low-cost water technology.

Kaniki has fashioned a rope pump, which is fast becoming an effective weapon for empowering resource-constrained rural and urban households to access safe and clean drinking water at an affordable price.

He describes rope pumps as modern low-cost technology, which can be used to pump water from shallow and deep wells.

He says its low-cost makes it also fit as a family pump where it proves to be a money-maker where the family wants to earn an income from the sale of water to neighbours.

“For small communal systems, they can use rope pumps for self -supply, domestic use, cattle watering and irrigation. You can use this technology to pump from one to 40 meters deep,” he explains.

Kaniki says the technology is cost-effective as it can be produced with materials that are available in local hardware stores and so simple that the users can easily maintain and repair it.

In partnership with Pump Aid Malawi, Zapew has installed 199 rope pumps in selected districts in the country. Some of the districts include Kasungu, Dedza, Ntcheu, Mchinji and Mangochi.

Matola Kampaliro, where Phiri lives with her six children, is one of the villages in Kasungu that have benefitted from the project Zapew has been implementing in partnership with Pump Aid Malawi.

She says the introduction of rope pumps has alleviated the challenges that women and girls face to fetch water from rivers and streams to the home.

“We used to travel long distances to draw water for domestic use. It was never easy at all. My daughters could not concentrate on their education because they spent most of their time hauling water from the streams,” she explains.

“But this is no longer a problem. We have running water right in front of our house. We no longer travel long distances to draw water for domestic use.”

And with support from Development Investment and Foundation, an Islamic social relief organisation, Zapew is currently installing rope pumps in Dedza, Mangochi and Ntcheu.

Kaniki says the project will enable thousands of households have access to clean and safe drinking water in the three districts.

“We wish to appeal to government and other organisations to partner with Zapew. We have the capacity to install rope pumps across the country,” he challenges.

In its latest report, Pump Aid Malawi stated that if well produced and installed, over 90 percent of these pumps stay working after many years of operation.

Another report says in Zimbabwe and Malawi, the model rope pump supplies water to over a million people.

“The pump is an attractive product for local entrepreneurs. And due to the shift from piston pumps to rope pumps (on wells to 60 meters deep), the rural water supply in Nicaragua increased 23 percent in ten years, three times faster than other countries,” reads part of the report.","SDG 6 seeks governments’ commitment to provide universal access to safe and affordable drinking water as well as universal access to improved sanitation by 2030.

New concerns are that a rapid spread of infection could lead to a larger outbreak that already over-burdened health services may not be able to contain. There are also new alarming reports in neighbouring Mozambique (that shares a border with Malawi), which has recorded more than 3400 cholera cases and 37 deaths since 25 December – many of them children.

Those infected with cholera can initially show minimal or no symptoms, but can still contribute to the spread of the disease. After infection, patients experience diarrhoea, vomiting and, in advanced stages, severe dehydration. If not properly treated, cholera can kill within hours and is especially dangerous for young children.

“As humanitarian actors in Malawi, we need to move quickly to stop any further spread of this disease,” said UNICEF Representative in Malawi, Mahimbo Mdoe. “These displaced populations are extremely vulnerable, particularly those with low-immunity, such as malnourished children. UNICEF is working to support the Government with mobile health services, as well as safe water, sanitation and hygiene services, which are critical factors in preventing the spread of cholera.”

Cholera poses a serious public health problem to populations in crowded environments, with inadequate water and sanitation resources. While cholera is endemic in Malawi, no cases have been reported in the last three years. The last time the country experienced a large-scale outbreak was in 2009, when well over 1000 people were infected.

UNICEF Chief of Health in Malawi, Kyaw Aung, says that effort has been made since the beginning of the crisis to prepare for such an outbreak. “UNICEF has dispatched protective equipment, 30 cholera beds, 15 isolation tents, medicines, IV fluids and 1,450 bottles of chlorine in health facilities,” said Mr Aung. “In addition, UNICEF has partnered with various government and non-governmental bodies, including MSF, GOAL Malawi and Red Cross, to implement health care services, health education on cholera, as well as hygiene promotion within the camps.”

UNICEF and partners, including the Ministry of Health and WHO, are monitoring the cases on a daily basis and working with partners on the ground, including MSF, to treat all suspected cases.

Background to the Malawi Floods 2015 In January, 15 districts across Malawi were devastated by floods. 230,000 people are still displaced as the rains continue, and 172 people still missing.

UNICEF Malawi has since the onset of the floods, been applying a multi-pronged approach to the problem on the ground, to contain a cholera and other water-borne and infectious diseases. UNICEF is currently preparing to launch a Measles Campaign, which includes clinics and preventive immunization in affected areas. WASH programs are a key component of the emergency effort. Since January, a total of 68,487 affected people have been given access to sanitation services, with support from The European Union and The UK’s Department for International Development.

Over 800,000 people have been affected by the flooding in the wake of Cyclone Idai in Malawi, with 59 dead and 672 injured. And as flood waters are starting to subside, it is a race against the clock to prevent the spread of water-borne diseases such as cholera.

The effects of Cyclone Ida have been catastrophic in Malawi. The heavy rains and floods washed away crops just one month away from harvest in southern Malawi. In Nsanje, floods affected over 13,000 hectares of crops and 16,000 livestock belonging to approximately 38,000 farming families.

“People here are desperate, they have lost everything they have and it is very, very difficult for them to survive,” Concern’s Country Director in Malawi, Yousaf Jogezai said today.

“They have had just so many shocks, with last year’s drought, flooding last January and now this latest flood, they have lost everything. In many cases their houses have been washed away or they have collapsed, their livestock is gone and this year’s harvest had been destroyed.”

Concern staff on the ground are facing a race against the clock. The immediate issue is the risk of water-borne diseases such as cholera and diarrhoea in the 173 temporary camps which are accommodating people displaced by flooding. Many people are sheltering in local schools and churches, which do not have sufficient toilets or bathing facilities for the numbers staying there.

Concern's response

Concern are working among the worst affected areas in the districts of Nsanje and Phalombe in southern Malawi. Our teams working with staff in the camps to construct latrines and bathrooms and to provide safe water supplies.

This week we will commence distributing emergency kits containing essential items such as plastic sheeting, cooking utensils, mosquito nets and soap to those who are displaced. We are aiming to provide relief support to 45,000 people in the coming days and weeks.

As part of our second response phase, we will provide people with tools and seeds, along with cash transfers to assist people with rebuilding their homes and non-agriculture livelihoods.","Cian Purcell-MiltonOver 800,000 people have been affected by the flooding in the wake of Cyclone Idai in Malawi, with 59 dead and 672 injured.

The flood affected populations have received immediate life-saving relief support including food, medicine, shelter, protection services and other non-food-items such as water, sanitation and hygiene supplies.

In early March, heavy rains and flooding linked to the cyclone killed 60 people, displaced nearly 87,000 people and affected around 870,000 persons. The Government of Malawi declared a State of Disaster on 8th March and subsequently launched a Flood Response Plan and Appeal on 28th March to support life-saving humanitarian interventions in 15 affected districts.

The flood response plan appeal has received US$ 25.6 million funding contributions and pledges out of a total requirement of US$ 45.2 million. Based on lessons learnt from the 2015 flood response, early recovery efforts have been integrated in the response plan to reduce further risks and mitigate the impact of future shocks.

UN Resident Coordinator, Maria Jose Torres, said the UN and partners triggered their support to the response almost immediately after the floods had hit, including, using prepositioned relief supplies. Additional support to the Government of Malawi’s Department of Disaster Management Affairs (DoDMA) includes facilitating coordination and information management to enhance the response operations. An Emergency Operations Centre is established in the Ministry of Homeland Security to facilitate coordination of field operations.

“We assisted the government to rapidly assess the immediate needs to inform the humanitarian response,” said Torres. “Beyond addressing the immediate needs, we are also supporting the Government to assess postdisaster recovery needs that will inform early to long term recovery interventions in the affected areas.”

A Post Disaster Needs Assessment (PDNA) has been undertaken by the Malawi Government, UN, World Bank and European Union to assess damages, losses and priority recovery needs and costs. The data and information collected will inform the Government’s flood recovery plan.

“In tandem with the emergency response, we are also working with all sectors to support the affected communities’ gradual transition to recovery. This includes the UN’s support to DoDMA’s decision to provide a return home package to displaced populations who have expressed interest to return to their homes. This move aligns well with the country’s national resilience building,” said Torres.

Within the framework of One UN, several UN offices, including the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO),

International Organization for Migration (IOM), United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), UN Women, World Food Programme (WFP), United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), United Nations Resident Coordinator’s Office (UNRCO) and World Health Organisation (WHO), are supporting the response in various ways that reflect their respective mandates and specialized expertise.

Below are more details on UN support to the response:

Over 91,000 households (over 410,000 people) provided with food or cash in nine districts. The food basket provided to 75 per cent of the people reached, comprises of a 50kg bag of maize, 10kgs of pulses and 2 litres of vegetable oil, while cash transfers of MK 18,000, equivalent to the value of the food basket, is provided to 25 per cent of the population reached.

As of 11 April, with UN support, the number of people reached with integrated health services in flood affected districts is 82,394. Other assitance includes screening, immunisation, reproductive health services and treatment of people in internally displacement sites through mobile.

Across the country, a total of 51,081 children (23,009 boys 28,072 girls) have been screened for malnutrition and 1,811 children (942 boys and 869 girls) with Severe Acute Malnutrition were admitted and treated through the Community-based Management of Acute Malnutrition programme. Of these, 121 children were admitted from the various camps. Mass screening and active case findings are ongoing focussing on eight prioritised floods affected distrcts ( Balaka, Chikwawa, Machinga, Mangochi,

Mulanje, Nsanje, Phalombe, and Zomba).

10,000 dignity kits have been distributed targeting vulnerable pregnant women, breastfeeding mothers and adolescent girls in displacement camps in the affected districts. The kit contains soaps, underwear, sanitary pads, sanitary cloth, wrapping cloth, tooth paste, shavers, plastic bucket and plastic cups among others. Additional 4,200 dignity kits have also been procured and will be distributed in the coming days.

Reproductive Health (RH) kits to prevent maternal and neonatal deaths have been distributed to nine flood affected districts. The RH kits include individual clean delivery kits, equipment and medicines for assisted delivery and management of unsafe abortion among others.

Messages on prevention and reporting of sexual and gender based violence are being dissmeinated through community and national radios including theatre.

A total of 54,209 people in 17 sites reached with safe water as per agreed standards through provision of water containers, treatment chemicals, and water trucking.

A total of 51,691 people in 19 sites reached with services as per agreed standards through the installation of emergency latrines and bath shelters separate for men and women. Also, hygiene messages have reached more than 45,000 people.

About 47,000 displaced people reached with shelter and non-food items in four districts.

About 180,000 people are planned to be targeted with early recovery interventions in six districts, with interventions including removal of debris and solid waste management, support for reconstruction of homes, provision of agricultural kits including farm implements to enable winter cropping, distribution of small livestock to increase the asset base of farmers and cash-based interventions to enhance the provision of basic household needs of the affected population.

A total of 28,812 learners (15,149 girls, 13,663 boys) in 143 schools in six districts provided with education supplies, temporary learning spaces and teachers, school meals and sanitation facilities. In addition, 2,731 Early Childhood Development (ECD) children (1458 girls, 1273 boys) supported with ECD kits and tent classrooms in 19 camps in five districts.

In line with the ‘Leave No One Behind’ principle, the Age, Gender and Diversity Mainstreaming (AGDM) tool was used to engender the humanitarian response through the clusters to ensure that life-saving support indeed reached the most disadvantaged and the furthest behind first.

The Humanitarian Country Team, comprising humanitarian and development actors, continues to monitor the situation, in addition to supporting the Government of Malawi to address the current emergency through coherent planning for short-term interventions that meet basic needs, and medium -and long- term programming that increases the coping capabilities of communities and households. These joint efforts reaffirm the shared commitment by the UN to strengthening the humanitarian-development nexus to achieve collective outcomes, improve community resilience, and ensure that no one is left behind.

Currently, there are more than 20 Agencies and specialized organizations of the United Nations active in Malawi which, through their work, contribute to ensuring a better life for the people of Malawi.

There are more than 11 million people now experiencing crisis or emergency levels of food insecurity (IPC Phases 3 and 4) in nine Southern African countries1 due to deepening drought and climate crisis. If urgent humanitarian action is not taken, the number will likely rise in the coming months, according to the Regional Interagency Standing Committee Africa (RIASCO).

In Zimbabwe, 3.58 million people are in IPC Phase 3 (Crisis) or Phase 4 (Emergency). In Zambia, 2.3 million people are currently estimated to be in IPC Phase 3 or worse. In southern Angola, 1.6 million people are impacted by the drought with at least 562,000 in IPC Phase 3 or worse. By September 2019, 1.6 million people in Mozambique faced difficulties in accessing food as a result of agricultural losses, internal displacement and destruction of infrastructure and livelihoods stemming from two cyclones that devastated in the country in March and April 2019. In southern Madagascar, 916,201 people are facing severe acute food insecurity.

Climate shocks and climate change. Climate change is a central force driving a continued rise in global hunger, with both droughts and flooding negatively impacting food production. Evidence shows children suffer disproportionately from the impact of climate change. In fragile states and low-income communities, including in Southern Africa, the poor and marginalized will be most affected. Persons in low-income quintiles of society – and particularly children, women and the elderly who are less capable of coping with the negative effects of climate change – will be the most severely affected.

• Western and central parts of the region are experiencing poor rainfall and bad drought conditions, with some parts of Southern Africa facing the lowest rates of rainfall since 1981. Namibia received its lowest recorded rainfall in 35 years leaving 40 percent of its 2.4 million people characterised as severely food insecure.In drought-affected parts of the region, a growing number of traditional community water points have dried out or do not meet the minimum water demand, resulting in household water insecurity, lack of water in institutions (including schools and health facilities), depletion of watering points for agriculture and livestock which in turn increases unplanned migration of people and livestock. The region has had only two favourable agricultural seasons since 2012 and many areas have yet to fully recover from the devastating impact of the 2015-2016 El Niño season.

• At the same time, the eastern part of the region saw unprecedented back-to-back cyclones (Idai and Kenneth) impacting Malawi, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Comoros and southern Tanzania.

• Southern Africa is currently at the forefront of the climate crisis and facing the consequences of it first-hand. Mitigation (reduced emissions) and adaptation (increased resilience) are required to reduce the impact of climate change in the coming years. A multisectoral and joint approach between UN Agencies with a focus on immediate life-saving response, as well as longer term systems strengthening is needed to address the complexities of climate change at the country level.

Access to water. In drought-affected parts of the region, a growing number of traditional community water points have dried out or do not meet the minimum water demand, resulting in household water insecurity, lack of water in institutions (including schools and health facilities), depletion of watering points for agriculture and livestock which in turn increases unplanned migration of people and livestock.

Lake Kariba, a critical water resource for Zambia and Zimbabwe, is only 16 per cent full at present, down 7.5 meters from the same time last year. In Zimbabwe, the fragile economic situation and cuts to electricity have impacted access to water, curtailing the ability of local authorities to pump water and procure water treatment chemicals for urban areas while in rural areas only 30 per cent of rural water sources have water, are functioning and are protected.

Nutrition. While Southern Africa does not report the critical levels of acute malnutrition seen in East Africa, any incremental increase in acute malnutrition, is an additional stress on the individual child and household. It also presents a stress on health system, which are often poorly equipped to deal with increasing numbers of acutely malnourished children. In addition, considering the high burden of stunting already present across Southern Africa, children that are both stunted and wasted have the highest risk of death compared to those who are stunted or wasted alone.

• In Zimbabwe, national global acute malnutrition (GAM) has risen to 3.6 per cent, up from 2.5 per cent in 2018, and eight districts have GAM rates above 5 per cent, which is rarely seen in Zimbabwe and signifies a deteriorating situation. Doctors in Zimbabwe have been on strike for the previous two months, which has led to an ongoing human resources crisis and may lead to additional challenges for the management of children with acute malnutrition or other resources if no urgent solutions are found.

• In Mozambique, an estimated 67,500 children require treatment for malnutrition, including 6,500 for severe acute malnutrition (SAM). More than 250 cases of pellagra (vitamin B3 deficiency) have been reported in Sofala province, which was hardest hit by Cyclone Idai.

• In Huíla and Cunene, in the south of Angola, between 70 and 80 per cent of the population are currently affected by food insecurity with increasing numbers of children identified as acutely malnourished through screening and programme admission data.

• Acute malnutrition continues to be of concern in the most drought affected districts of southern Madagascar, with 17,800 children treated for SAM with UNICEF support in 2019 to date, compared to 8,643 during the same time in 2018, largely due to a scale up in outreach screening and referral activities. An additional threat is the likely pipeline break for commodities for treating moderately malnourished children, which will likely lead to an increase in the numbers of severely malnourished children.

• A continuing challenge across Southern Africa relates to the lack of representative quality and up to date nutrition information in the most vulnerable communities and most drought-affected areas. This limitsthe ability to highlight the severity of the situation in terms of nutrition outcomes and can mean that a deteriorating situation may not be recognized in time to protect children from becoming malnourished. Representative and quality nutrition assessments in the most affected areas are key to support evidence-based targeted and timely responses.

Agriculture and livelihoods. The aggregate regional cereal output in 2019, including a production forecast for the winter wheat crops, to be harvested from October, is estimated to be nearly seven per cent below the 2018 production. The largest yearly decreases were registered in Mozambique, South Africa, Zambia and Zimbabwe. Production of maize, the main staple in the region, is estimated at nearly 10 per cent below the previous five-year average. Livestock rearing and production—a key coping and resilience pathway and a contributor to national GDP in Southern Africa—is also being impacted by reduced water availability and degradation of pastures, as well as increased outbreak of transboundary animal diseases.3 In the southern region of Angola, the drought has affected 2.2 million cattle and 1.2 million sheep, leading to the death of 27,767 animals. The continued presence of the Fall Armyworm (FAW) and Cassava Brown Streak Disease, a new disease reported for the first time in northern Zambia, are presenting additional risks to crop production in the region. Macro-economic volatility, including high levels of inflation, rising unemployment and eroded household purchasing power have further compounded the high levels of food insecurity in several countries.

Health. During 2019, climate shocks have exacerbated outbreaks of measles in several countries across the Southern African region, including Angola (3,127 cases with 64 deaths, of which 73 per cent are from Lunda Sul, and 17 per cent from Moxico, with 85 laboratory confirmed as of 30 June 2019); Comoros (132 cases with no deaths, 56 confirmed by 11 August 2019) and Madagascar (a total of 202,692 cases with 966 deaths reported from 7 October 2018 to 10 Sept 2019). Namibia is facing an expansion of transmission of hepatitis E and has been experiencing an outbreak since 2017 in informal settlements with poor access to safe water and sanitation, with 6,527 cases and 55 deaths (including 1,585 confirmed cases) reported by 6 October 2019. These countries also have a significant HIV burden. Food insecurity and resulting malnutrition in people living with HIV, especially children, is associated with increased morbidity and mortality.

During the 2016/17 drought, a reduction in outpatient consultations and admissions in some countries of Southern Africa like Lesotho, (including for deliveries) were reported due to closure of health facilities as water was depleted, leaving communities without access to critical health services. Approximately 135/404 health districts in Angola, Madagascar, Malawi, Mozambique, Eswatini and Zimbabwe reported increased caseloads resulting from upsurges of diarrhoea, pneumonia and malaria, which put pressure on health facilities (RIASCO 2017). Outbreaks of waterborne diseases occurred against the backdrop of severe water shortages resulting from the drought.","In fragile states and low-income communities, including in Southern Africa, the poor and marginalized will be most affected.

This is WINGOC’s motto. It manages one of the only facilities in the world to produce drinking water from wastewater. In 2001 the consortium signed an operating contract with the city of Windhoek aimed at improving the water treatment processes and increasing the site’s production capacity. Recycling wastewater increases the amount of drinking water available, but it also has a twofold benefit for the environment: it avoids tapping into natural resources and significantly reduces pollutant discharges.

Namibia is one of the most arid countries in Africa: the average rainfall is 250 mm per year, but the heat causes 83% to evaporate - only 1% of rainwater infiltrates into the ground. Consequently, the water supply of Windhoek - located in central Namibia - depends mainly on boreholes and three dams located 60 and 200 km away. To cope with shortages, the city has sought alternative solutions to secure its water supply.

A process that mimics nature

To transform the wastewater from Windhoek’s 350,000 residents into drinking water, the Goreangab water treatment plant uses a process that mimics nature.

""Everything is done biologically. The bacteria help digest the human waste and pull it out of the water, essentially mimicking what happens in nature but a whole lot faster,"" said Justina Haihambo, Process Engineer at the plant.

The facility features state-of-the-art ""multi-barrier"" technology: ozone treatment, ultra membrane filtration and residual chlorination. This process eliminates all pollutants and contaminants. The various treatments, coupled with rigorous bio-monitoring programs, guarantee high quality, safe drinking water. It is a global benchmark since the only cities in the world to produce drinking water from their wastewater are Windhoek and Singapore.



""The Goreangab plant has become an international benchmark, an innovative and sustainable water management model and an example of a successful public-private partnership that attracts experts from Australia, Singapore and the United States. And if in the future the climate becomes even drier, recycling water will be even more important"", said Pierre van Rensburg, head of Windhoek's water department.

""With the increasing risk of water stress, Veolia is a solid partner in implementing complex solutions. Today, the efficient process used in Windhoek has yet to be developed in Africa"", concluded Patrice Fonlladosa, Senior Executive Vice President Africa-Middle East Veolia

A convoy of fuel trucks blocks the single-lane road, moving in a close herd. Warm air floods through the window. The scenery drags past mountains and thorny acacia.A gravel road leads to the S Von Bach dam. It is one of three dams supplying Windhoek with water , and it is nearly empty.For Windhoek, home to Namibia’s industry and 20 per cent of its 2.3 million people, this is an intractable problem. The national utility, NamWater, says the city has six months of water left. After that, it will be up to people’s ingenuity to keep the taps dripping.But drought is nothing new in Namibia. The only consistent rivers form the country’s northern and southern borders. Its ephemeral rivers only flow when it floods, looking like lazy brown snakes with full bellies lounging on a parched and cracked countryside.South of Von Bach dam lies Windhoek, encased in a lumpy basket of hills.The dry riverbeds, overwhelmed by reeds and rubbish, are crossed by drifts. Red and white metre sticks give an idea of how deep they are during flash floods that bash Windhoek.“When you have no other options, people will accept anything you put on the table,” says Pierre van Rensburg, one of the City of Windhoek’s chief water engineers, as he cancels incoming calls to talk about his city’s relationship with water. “It was decided that we would reuse our wastewater.”The 30-minute drive to the jewel in Windhoek’s water supply system starts in the original city centre, which is characterised by wide boulevards and old, large-brick offices, and ends next to the fields of zinc settlements to the north where people have to queue with buckets to get water.In Namibia, water scarcity and environmental realities are taught from a young age. “If you can get one student interested, they’ll go home excited and talk to five family members,” van Rensburg says.The Goreangab Water Reclamation Plant was born out of Windhoek’s water emergency in the 1960s. It was the first in the world to take municipal wastewater and turn it into municipal drinking water, van Rensburg adds.Older and lagging behind technologically, it has been turned into a plant for irrigation water. While the technology is accepted globally, drinking water that was once wastewater is not except in Windhoek.From the top of Goreangab, gravity pushes the wastewater through large flotation ponds and aeration tanks. These disturb, swirl and bubble the sewage until the last few pollutants are caught up in membranes. The water that comes out is clean.“People are always trying to catch us out so they can say that reusing water doesn’t work. They haven’t succeeded,” Van Rensburg says, his voice a shade removed from smug. He has the same air of confident pride that Namibians have when talking about their unique water system.Van Rensburg says being a world leader places incredible pressure on everyone involved. “We can’t have one slip up because just one illness will have serious repercussions,” he adds. This has not happened to date.From the plant, water is piped to the centre of Windhoek, where it is mixed with water coming from NamWater. A quarter of all the water coming out of taps in the city had once left the city in a sewage pipe. That water costs 11 Namibian dollars (about 70 US cents) per cubic metre to supply. NamWater charges about US$1.Van Rensburg — who first came to the plant as an intern expecting to make coffee and instead got to work with its chief engineer — criss-crosses the world talking about the plant. South Africa has been a frequent destination. But nobody seems to be listening. A multi-million dollar plant in Australia was stopped after a referendum.Only Malaysia and Texas in the United States have plants working on a large scale.South Africa has one working plant in the Western Cape town of Beaufort West. It didn’t look across the Orange River for tips. Van Rensburg says Namibians are used to being snubbed by their neighbour. “People will only change when they have no other options, so let’s see if you then realise there’s a technology that works next door.”The technology works, but perception is key. In South Africa, eThekwini in KwaZulu-Natal tried to get ten per cent of its water from two reuse plants. But a community petition objected, citing religious objections, and a belief that other sources of water could be found. Municipal engineers have previously told the general public that there is really very little they can do about “irrational fears”. Thus, national government has had to turn to desalination plants - producing water at double, sometimes triple, the cost of other sources.The worst drought in a century, a precursor of a climate impacted future, is moving the discussion to a point where there are few solutions on the table.That future is unfolding in Namibia. Windhoek’s three dams overflowed once in the 1970s, and again in 2006. Since then the water has spilt over their walls on three occasions. In 2012 and 2014, no water flowed into the dams. The evaporation rate is ten times the annual rainfall of 350 millimetres. Floods and water scarcity have forced Windhoek to turn to aquifers that used to supply it, turning them into underground storage. By 2019, this will give the city 18-months water supply, says Van Rensburg.However, a similar solution is impossible in South Africa - despite similar rock formations - because extensive mining has irreparably polluted most underground aquifers, Van Rensburg explains.Lesley-Anne van Wyk, project coordinator for the Environmental Awareness and Climate Change Project at the Hanns Seidel Foundation Namibia, says:“Water is obviously — finally — topical in Namibia because we are staring at the cliff’s edge, again.”Van Wyk explains that the water scarce country is bedevilled by the human tendency to only worry about problems when it is too late to take preventative action. “In some ways leaving it late has made us great at innovating : nothing drives technology like necessity.”But an artificial construction boom - many people in Namibia talk sarcastically about the “great boom” being the only thing propping up the economy - means water is not at the heart of forward thinking, she says. “Namibia has always had this problem of not making the tough decisions and continuing to build in the middle of the country, where we have no water,” van Wyk adds. We leave, joining the rushed drivers of Windhoek in the quest to find other people to talk to. One radio presenter – pausing to take a deep, thirsty, gulp of his Hansa (Namibian beer) before telling us that people seem unconcerned about the impending collapse in water supply. “It’s human nature to think disaster won’t happen. The taps still work, so people keep watering their gardens at midday.”He takes another long sip. Beer is a welcome change to Windhoek’s tap water. “We’re in a better home than our neighbours because of our technological innovation, but this is still a hell of a crisis,” says the radio presenter.Disclaimer: This piece was co-produced by SciDev.Net’s Sub-Saharan Africa English and the Mail & Guardian newspaper in South Africa, as part of a science journalism capacity building initiative, funded by the Wellcome Trust.","“If you can get one student interested, they’ll go home excited and talk to five family members,” van Rensburg says.The Goreangab Water Reclamation Plant was born out of Windhoek’s water emergency in the 1960s.
It was the first in the world to take municipal wastewater and turn it into municipal drinking water, van Rensburg adds.Older and lagging behind technologically, it has been turned into a plant for irrigation water.

The program will facilitate sustainable production and transfer of water resources to improve access to potable water and for agricultural and industrial use. It will also enhance sanitation in rural areas and enrich institutional capacity, sustainable management and utilization.

In particular, it seeks to increase access to sustainable water services from the current level of 85% and sanitation services from 54% to the universal 100% target by 2030.

Namibia is grappling with a national water crisis due to severe droughts. The 2018/19 rainy season, one of the driest since 1981, only received 50% or less of average seasonal rainfall, thereby posing serious constraints to the southern African nation’s economic, environmental and social development agenda.

The program, to be implemented over five years, entails the construction and rehabilitation of bulk water infrastructure and associated fixtures, construction of water supply schemes and climate resilient inclusive sanitation facilities, hygiene interventions and institutional capacity building initiatives.

A key element of the project is sanitation marketing, focusing on behavioural change, Gladys Wambui Gichuri, Director of the Water Development & Sanitation Department told Board members. “It is critical to improve sanitation, including reducing the number of people practising open defecation,” she said.

The project aligns to Namibia’s national development plans and a government priority to boost the availability and affordability of water as a basic element for making Namibia a prosperous and industrialized nation by 2030.

The program is building on innovative technology in sanitation in Namibia which treats its wastewater in Windhoek to potable standards and injects 30% of the recycled water into the system for distribution to consumers. The program includes preparation of studies and designs for direct potable water reclamation in Windhoek to increase the existing capacity by 17,000 m3/day.

Located in southern Africa and bordering the Atlantic Ocean, the Republic of Namibia is known for its sweeping deserts and mineral exports. However, the country’s dry climate makes it susceptible to drought, which means there are scarce freshwater resources. Here are five things you should know about water quality in Namibia.

Five Things Facts About Water Quality in Namibia

Water quality in Namibia has greatly improved since the 1990s. Total improved water increased from 70 percent in 1990 to 91 percent in 2015. Great improvements were seen in rural areas, where roughly 53 percent of the population resides. The proportion of the rural population with improved drinking water increased from 58 percent in 1990 to 85 percent in 2015. Despite improvements, water quality in Namibia is still lacking in rural areas. This is partly due to the difficulty of upkeep and system installation in communities with limited resources. “The disturbing truth is that installed rural water supply infrastructure is far harder to keep operational than hoped for, and often fails before its planned design lifetime due to poor maintenance,” the Rural Water Supply Network wrote in a report. Rural communities are coming up with their own ways to clean and filter water. Among these is the use of filtration cloths. Water is poured over a piece of fabric that catches contaminants. Tests reveal that certain kinds of cloth, such as cotton, can even remove some microorganisms as well. While these methods are not as effective as a modern filtration system, they offer a temporary solution for vulnerable communities. The government has taken steps to improve water quality in Namibia by creating policies focused on regulating wastewater reuse and water saving. The Water and Sanitation Policy, or WASP, which was enacted in 1993, is an example of such policy. Since WASP was established, the water supply in rural areas has increased enough to meet the domestic and livestock requirements of the majority of the farming population. This improvement has had a great impact because 72 percent of Namibia’s water is used for agriculture. Technology has played a significant role in increasing access to and improving water quality in Namibia. The capital city, Windhoek, pioneered direct potable reuse systems, or DPR. DPR is the process of treating wastewater and then returning it to the water supply without using an environmental buffer, such as a reservoir, first. Namibia’s DPR system has been operating since 1968 and has been so efficient that some U.S. agencies are studying its success.

Despite countless environmental and geographic challenges, the Namibian people have used innovation and technology to make great progress in improving water quality and availability in Namibia.

NAMIBIA needs roughly N$12 billion to avert the challenges associated with poor water supply for both industrial and human consumption.

This amount can get the country out of its water woes and create sustainable water solutions, the executive director in the agriculture, water and forestry ministry, Percy Misika, said yesterday at the Open Africa Round-table Financing Water Projects' event.



The roundtable was aimed at making public-private partnerships work for efficient urban water supply.



Speaking to delegates on how to mitigate water shortages, Misika said the country's water utility, Namibia Water Corporation (NamWater), can only raise N$2 billion internally, leaving the government with a N$10 billion funding gap.



“The water sector is underfunded in Namibia, and priority is being put to make sure that by 2022, Namibia will be in a position to provide water to its citizens, in line with the national development plans,” he noted.



He added that the country is ravaged by ripple effects of climate change, including the worst drought in years currently being experienced.



Namibia is also plunged in a severe water shortage that needs the government to seek investments from private sector players to avert the situation, Misika said, adding that the country is aiming to have a sustainable water distribution network for human and industrial needs by 2022.



Namibia is one of the driest countries in the sub-Saharan region.



“The dry conditions and low rainfall patterns put us in a precarious situation, and leaves us in a position which forces us to import the bulk of our food because we cannot produce our own as a result of water shortages,” Misika stated.



“Because of the ongoing dry season, we have experienced abnormal dry conditions and a severe drought that has hit our country. Other challenges faced by the government in terms of finding water and sanitation is the unavailability of resources,” he said.



Speaking at the same event Namwater chief executive officer Abraham Nehemia underscored the need for public-private partnerships in averting the looming water challenge. He said: “We are looking at various avenues including desalination as well as tapping into aquifers and partnerships to deal with the water problem.”

236,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/aug/07/how-an-ancient-well-is-bringing-northern-namibia-water-until-funds-dry-up,How an ancient well is bringing northern Namibia water – until funds dry up,"When water first flowed from the new community pump in Eenhana this spring, some locals were slow to celebrate. Groundwater has a tainted reputation in this fast-developing, northern Namibian town. Many people in the area still rely on hand-dug wells that double up as watering holes for cattle.

“It was not like those wild west movies, where they strike oil and Stetsons are thrown in the air,” says Martin Quinger, a groundwater hydrologist, “but once the news spread there was a huge amount of excitement that the whole area will flourish and bloom.”

Quinger is leading a project to draw drinking water from Ohangwena II – an ancient aquifer under Namibian and Angolan soil that spans an area roughly 70km by 40km on the Namibian side of the border and is 250m-350m deep.

In 2012, when Quinger and his colleagues from the German Federal Institute for Geosciences and Natural Resources (BGR) announced their discovery of Ohangwena II, they estimated its stored volume in Namibia at 5bn cubic metres – equivalent to the current demand in the north of the country for 400 years.

That estimate has quadrupled to 20bn cubic metres, and the BGR team now believe the aquifer will naturally recharge with surface water from southern Angola, provided extraction rates remain tolerably low. With careful husbandry, Ohangwena II could be a permanent drinking water reserve for northern Namibia.

The BGR is working in partnership with the Namibian ministry of agriculture, water and forestry and the water supplier NamWater to establish Ohangwena II as a working resource. The team has drilled three boreholes – costing €700,000 (£627,000) each – to deliver two water supply schemes, the design of which can be copied in other locations as funds for drilling become available.

The scheme in Eenhana delivers 40 cubic metres of water per hour for around 20,000 people, with a potential to increase production to up to 120m³/h. In the Omundaunguilo constituency, further to the north, a proposed wellfield capable of drawing 10 million cubic metres annually could serve rural communities with water so clean that it would fulfil the criteria required of European mineral water.

Quinger says access to water from Ohangwena II has already made a huge difference to people in Eenhana. “The interest of people there in the development is enormous,” he says. “Everybody was asking questions and was so happy the water supply is now on safer ground.

“This whole area is going to develop in the next 20 years – but as I have seen in my time here, when there is a drought, industrialisation stops. Stretching the supply of surface water here is just not possible, so using groundwater from Ohangwena II is the only option to make social and economic development happen.”

These are historically dry times for Namibia, which in 2016 experienced its worst drought in 25 years. Crops failed, a state of emergency was declared, and companies – including Coca-Cola – moved their operations elsewhere.

The incidence of drought in northern Namibia appears to be increasing – but despite Namibians’ demands for water security, the funding for the BGR’s work to tap into Ohangwena II is drying up.

“We are under time constraints,” says Quinger. “This project is going to come to an end in September next year, and before then we were hoping we could at least get a real large-scale extraction scheme on-track – to more or less back-up-supply the whole of central-northern Namibia. We need the initial project funds to do this, and at the moment these are not available.

“Namibia is in financial crisis, and a vicious circle of no funds for investment leading to no development is downgrading the economy.”

Drilling boreholes to tap into Ohangwena II is costly, but Quinger says the BGR’s approach will be cheaper in the long-term than developing an equivalent supply from surface water. Natural hydraulic pressure causes the aquifer’s water to rise to 10m-20m below the surface when a borehole breaches it, which means extraction by pump is energy- and cost-efficient.

As the BGR’s cooperation with the Namibian ministry winds down, work is under way on a sustainability focused infrastructure for future development of Ohangwena II.

“It is Namibia’s first time managing a large-scale groundwater resource like this, and in order to do so you need a lot of products, tools and guidelines to give you the legal and technical basis to do the work,” says Quinger. “So, we have developed a new groundwater database for the whole country, to store monitoring data and observe the quality and quantity of the resource being used.”

Though his team’s involvement in Ohangwena II is set to end next year, Quinger is upbeat about the aquifer’s future as a resource. “We know how to do it, we know it’s sustainable,” he says. “I’m not afraid we’re not on a good track. It’s vital for northern Namibia to be independent in its water supply.”

240,https://allafrica.com/stories/202003250937.html,Namibia: Windhoek to Reconnect Defaulters' Water,"IN LIGHT of the coronavirus pandemic, the City of Windhoek has directed that water supplies that had been disconnected because of non-payment of bills will be reconnected for the next 30 days.

This is in line with president Hage Geingob's declaration last week of the novel coronavirus as a state of emergency to enable the country to mobilise resources to respond to the crisis.

The country has so far recorded seven confirmed cases of Covid-19.

The fourth case was confirmed on Monday after a Namibian male who returned from London on 18 March, tested positive for the virus.

Windhoek mayor Fransina Kahungu told a press conference yesterday that water supplies for defaulting clients will be reconnected and be disconnected again after 30 days.

he directive was effective from last Monday.

The municipality will also scale up the provision of water in informal settlements, including the placement of water tanks at strategic places.

""Municipal buses and vehicles will be disinfected after every cycle and bus drivers will be provided with sanitisers, masks and gloves,"" she said. Meanwhile, owners of public transport will be required to sanitise their vehicles and to ensure that their clients' hands are sanitised.

Public vehicle owners will also be required to ensure that their vehicles are not crowded to avoid close contact of their passengers.

Kahungu said contractors on site who are busy with the electrification of informal settlements will continue and precautionary measures will be put in place to minimise exposure.

However, the signing of leases for household owners will be put on hold until further notice.

""The city of Windhoek was busy carrying out the mass registration of informal structures as part of upgrading informal settlements. This mass registration is now put on hold until further notice,"" she said.

The mayor said markets and industrial stalls will remain open and traders are urged to adopt appropriate precautionary measures and good hygiene practices.

She added that the municipality will ensure that markets are thoroughly cleaned, disinfected and sanitised.

""Illegal street vendors should be removed and City Police should do law enforcement in this regard,"" she said. Business owners are required to ensure that their businesses are not overcrowded and to ensure their customers maintain safe distances.

The mayor said shebeens will now be opened from 12h00 to 19h00, while bars and night clubs will be opened from 20h00 to midnight.

""New applications for shebeen licences will not be processed during this period of 30 days,"" she said.

OTHER DIRECTIVES

Cleaners at public facilities will be supplied with protective clothing, continuous disinfection of public toilets and damaged ablution facilities will be fixed and related infrastructure rehabilitated.

Breathalyser testing of motorists by traffic police officers will be suspended for the next 30 days.

Meanwhile, the Ongwediva Town Council says it will also reconnect the water supply of households whose water connections had been cut over the non-payment of their municipal accounts.

Ongwediva municipal spokesperson Jackson Muma in a statement issued yesterday said residents whose water supply had been cut should visit the town council offices to have their supply reconnected.

This exercise, Muma said, is being carried out to ensure the supply of water and promote personal hygiene as part of preventative measures against the spread of the virus. Muma said the public should note that no reconnection fee would be charged and water consumption would be charged as usual.

""The outstanding bills should still be paid. This arrangement should not be construed as free service. We are just not disconnecting any water until further notice,"" he said.

The town council's decision comes after former urban and rural development minister Peya Mushelenga on 20 March ordered all local authorities to reconnect the water supply to households whose water had been suspended for non-payment.

Mushelenga said all citizens need to wash their hands and water is a basic need.

Minister Calle Schlettwein announced this while motivating the ministry's budget in the National Assembly on Monday.

Schlettwein said the Fifth National Development Plan (NDP5) and the Harambee Prosperity Plan (HPP) identifies the water sector as one of the focus areas.

Schlettwein said from the total of N$929 million, an amount of N$657 million is earmarked for the capital projects in the water sector, while an amount of N$80 million is earmarked for Covid-19 water subsidy, whereas the remaining N$272 million is intended for operational expenditures.

Furthermore, Schlettwein said to avoid water shortages within two to four years, the ministry has allocated an amount of N$3.6 billion to upgrade among others the Gammams Direct Potable Reclamation, Kombat-Berg Aukas power supply and the refurbishment of the Von Bach pump stations to enhance water supply to the central areas of Namibia.

Also, he said, the money will be used for the refurbishment of the Kuiseb Collector 2 and replacement of the Schwarzekuppe-Swakopmund and Omdel-Wlotzkasbaken pipelines to improve water supply at the central coastal areas.

He added likewise, the upgrading and extension of the Oshakati Water Treatment Plant (OWTP) and the Rundu Purification Plant to improve water supply in the central northern areas and Kavango East region particularly in Rundu town and surrounding areas.

He said a loan amount of N$1.8 billion has been secured from the African Development Bank (AfDB) for these projects, leaving a shortfall of N$1.8 billion.

Furthermore, Schlettwein says for this financial year, an amount of N$360 million is required as government co-financing, of which only N$73 million is allocated.

He said an alternative funding option would have to be found during the MTEF period to avoid a serious water crisis in any part of the country. Furthermore, he said, of the total allocation earmarked for capital projects, an amount of N$529 million is provided for the settlement of claims by the contractor of Neckartal Dam.

For the rural water supply programme, Schlettwein said the ministry has allocated N$54 million that will be used for the the finalisation of the construction of Ondangwa-Omuntele pipeline extension and King Kauluma-Omutsegwonime Water Supply Scheme in Oshikoto region, the construction of water supply scheme for the displaced communities of Kavango East (Shamvhura to Shamangorwa pipeline) and the commencement of the construction of the Ruacana South Water Supply scheme. - ktjitemisa@nepc.com.na","The Agriculture, Water and Land Reform ministry has been allocated an amount of N$929 million in order to improve the water security situation in the country, including upgrading of the existing infrastructure.

242,https://www.afrik21.africa/en/namibia-government-wants-to-speed-up-walvis-bay-desalination-project/,NAMIBIA: Government wants to speed up Walvis Bay desalination project,"As Namibia barely recovers from the long period of drought that rocked the country during the last dry season, the government wants to carry out a major desalination project. It will be developed in the town of Walvis Bay. According to John Mutorwa, Namibia’s Minister of Agriculture, Water and Forestry, the project’s feasibility study is expected to be completed soon.

The desalination project is becoming a priority for the Namibian government in the water sector. The objective is to pump water from the Atlantic Ocean and carry out treatment via a large desalination plant built in the town of Walvis Bay. The water will then be used to supply the city of Windhoek in Namibia and Gaborone, the capital of neighbouring Botswana. This southern African country is also affected by drought. And, unlike Namibia, it has no access to the sea.

Shortage in drinking water production in Windhoek and Gaborone

For the moment, no details are available on the Walvis Bay desalination project. Undoubtedly, more will be known with the delivery of the results of the feasibility study currently underway … This is an important project that has been mobilising both countries for several years. It has been reactivated because of the increasing number of droughts.

The situation is expected to worsen further according to the Namibian government’s forecasts. “By 2050, the deficit in the production of drinking water in Namibia’s coastal areas will be of the order of 36 million m3 per year. The amount of additional water demand for Windhoek and surrounding communities during the same period will be in the order of 32 million cubic metres per year, while the projected demand for Gaborone in Botswana would be 20 million cubic metres per year,” says Minister John Mutorwa.

Germany’s support

The construction of a desalination plant in Walvis Bay could help to reduce the deficit in drinking water production. The project is expected to require huge investments, in particular for the transport of water from Walvis Bay to Gaborone (via Windhoek). A distance of over 1490 km separates the two cities but they are already connected by a road. The water pipeline could follow this route. Namibia and Botswana are expected to finance the future facility. The two governments reaffirmed their willingness to work together during the visit of former Botswana President Seretse Khama Ian Khama to Windhoek in 2018.

Both countries could benefit from German support through its development agency, Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau (KfW). In addition, a few days ago the German ambassador to Namibia Herbert Beck took part in a workshop on a feasibility study on seawater desalination in Namibia. The aim of the study is to provide a detailed analysis of water demand in the coastal and central regions, specifically the cities of Windhoek, Walvis Bay and Swakopmund.

The other objective of the study is to formulate proposals regarding, among others, the corresponding desalination option, the water transfer system and the necessary power infrastructure. The Namibian government is betting on solar power, a renewable energy source that is widely available in the country.

This part of the continent is particularly affected by drought. In the Zambezi region of northeastern Namibia, the situation is critical for both humans and animals. The conditions are such that the Namibian government has urgently released N$19.7 million (US$1.33 million) for water supply.

“We have purchased water pipes to help communities that do not have water to connect to boreholes so that they no longer have to travel long distances in search of water,” says Lawrence Sampofu, Governor of the Zambezi region. These pipes will be connected to installations that pump water from the groundwater table to feed the network.

The region’s drinking water supply depends on rivers, including the Chobe, Linyanti and Kwando rivers, but they dried up. Some boreholes in the region have suffered the same fate. Some of these rivers also serve as living environments for crocodiles and hippos. Their drying out causes a critical situation for these animals. The Namibian Ministry of Environment and Tourism has responded urgently by installing a borehole that is now used to supply the ponds.

The ordeal of the animals in Hwange Park…

Drought is also affecting Zimbabwe. More than 300 km from the Zambezi region is Hwange National Park, which covers an area of 14,651 km2, the largest in Zimbabwe. Surface water sources have already dried up in this conservation area, which contains more than 45,000 elephants.

Even this pachyderm, known for its resistance to drought, is succumbing to the vagaries of the weather. In the last two months, 55 elephants have died of hunger, but mostly thirst in Hwange National Park. Drilling has been built on both sides of the park, but it is not sufficient to meet the water needs of the animals.

“Although we have made efforts to try to convert some of the water pumping stations from diesel to solar power, we have found that some water basins are drying out. We are asking for more resources for the installation of diesel pumps to complement the solar pumps,” says Samson Chibaya, director of the Hwange Zambezi cluster. Hwange National Park is expected to be green again with the arrival of the rainy season in November.

They were present to attend the inauguration ceremony of the Calueque-Oshakati Transboundary Drinking Water Supply Project, implemented by the Angola-Namibia Joint Permanent Technical Commission on the Cunene River Basin (PJTC). It is a commission working under the aegis of the Southern African Development Community (SADC).

The project aims to rehabilitate and upgrade existing water supply infrastructure, including the Calueque-Oshakati canal (about 150 km long) that supplies irrigation and drinking water to northern Namibia. The canal is affected by serious losses, pollution and sedimentation problems that generate high maintenance and purification costs. Infrastructure has suffered from the civil war in Angola, as well as illegal water withdrawals. In northern Namibia, 800,000 people are currently benefiting from the canal’s supply and another 100,000 in southern Angola will soon be supplied thanks to the work that has been carried out.

According to Alpheus Naruseb, Namibia’s Minister of Agriculture, Water and Forestry, his country will continue to strengthen cooperation with Angola for a better “management and joint development of the water resources of the two communities”.

The European Union’s support

If the project will benefit an additional 100,000 people on the Angolan side, it is because a new water treatment plant has been built there. It was delivered during the second quarter of 2018. For this joint project, the two governments helped each other for funding. They received support from the European Union through the EU-Africa Infrastructure Trust Fund (EU-AITF), which provided €2.4 million. This money made it possible to finance the identification and preparation of the project. This led to two feasibility studies. The technical assistance grant was provided by the Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau (KfW), a German development bank.

These various services have been decentralised to the regions under the aegis of the regional councils,” said Joseph Hailwa, Director of the Ministry of Agriculture, Water and Forestry in Namibia. The reason he says so is that he has just been appointed as the person in charge of decentralising rural drinking water supply and sanitation services in Namibia.

From now on, each regional council will manage the supply of drinking water in rural areas in a decentralised way, with the exception of the Khomas region where the service will be directly managed by the central government. It is in this region that Windhoek, the capital of Namibia, is located. This transfer of skills will be carried out gradually, as the Ministry of Agriculture, Water and Forestry will continue to monitor, control and plan the various policies. This mission will be supported by a team that will visit the regions to assess, “good water and sanitation management in rural areas and, above all, to maintain existing standards”.

“The Ministry will be responsible for coordinating the budget, including during parliamentary discussions. Once the budget is approved, the operational funds for decentralised services will be transferred to the regional councils, which will dispose of them in accordance with the procedures provided for by the law in force,” explains Joseph Hailwa. According to the Namibian government, this decision to make the regions autonomous in terms of rural water and sanitation management is the result of a growing awareness of the situation in remote areas.

According to the Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Directorate, 20% of people do not have access to these services in the country’s various villages. The same direction hopes that the Namibian government’s new decision will “reduce this figure”. The authorities want to extend this commitment to the management of the country’s forests. Agriculture will also follow, “in the coming budget years,” Joseph Hailwa said.

The Energy Ministers of the two countries recently signed an agreement, which will allow the launching of a call for tenders to select the company, which will build the future dam and its hydroelectric plant. The two governments plan to start work in 2021 and commission the facilities in 2025.

“If we keep to the schedule of the agreement, we will be able to meet the deadlines, as there is great interest in this bi-national project,” says João Baptista Borges, Angola’s Minister of Energy and Water. In order to achieve their common goal, Namibia and Angola will have to invest $1.2 billion.

A rockfill dam with concrete lining

The Baynes hydroelectric project is strategic for both countries. On the Namibian side, the government wants to reduce the country’s dependence on electricity imports, particularly from South Africa. This electricity has become more expensive since the beginning of the crisis facing the South African state-owned company Eskom. In Angola, the government wants to diversify its electricity mix, which is largely dominated by fossil fuels, including oil.

The Baynes dam will be built on the Cunene River, which serves as a natural border between the two countries. The reservoir will be located 200 km downstream of the Ruacana hydroelectric power station in Namibia with a capacity of 330 MW. Baynes is a concrete-lined rockfill dam with a height of 200 m. Its reservoir will be 43 km long with a maximum width of 4 km. The area flooded by the reservoir would be 57 km² and would contain more than 2,650 million m³ of water.

A capacity of 600 MW

The Baynes dam will operate with a hydroelectric power plant with a capacity of 600 MW. Electricity will be shared equally between Namibia and Angola (300 MW per country). According to NamPower, the state-owned company that distributes electricity in Namibia, the dam will operate like the Ruacana dam.

Specifically, during the rainy season, the Baynes power station will operate at full capacity, while during the dry season, the generators will only run at full capacity during average and peak periods, while 71 MW will be produced during off-peak periods.

According to Namibia’s Prime Minister, Saara Kuugongelwa, “in different parts of the country, drought has damaged farmland and pastures”. She says 350,000 people are at risk of starvation due to the drought. Most areas are suffering from water shortages. Watersheds are virtually dry. They did not receive enough water during the last rainy season. In this context of food insecurity, the Namibian government has requested the intervention of the World Food Programme (WFP) to provide an urgent response to the risk of famine in the country.

International community intervention

Namibia has a population of 2.4 million in fourteen regions. Eight of the regions are currently affected by drought in the central and northern parts of the country. As a first step, the WFP has started to intervene in the regions directly affected by the crisis. The organisation is implementing monthly food rations in kind for vulnerable food-insecure people. The distribution is done in partnership with the US Agency for International Development (USAID) office of Food for Peace (FFP). The U.S. Ambassador to Namibia Lisa Johnson and Namibian Prime Minister Saara Kuugongelwa-Amadhila recently delivered more than 85 tons of food to 12,000 vulnerable drought-affected people in the East and West Kavango regions of northeastern Namibia.

Before the drought hit the people, it took its toll on wildlife. A report by the Namibian Ministry of Agriculture in April 2019 indicated that 63,700 animals had died in 2018 due to drought. This prompted the Namibian government to auction almost 1,000 wild animals in June 2019. The money raised from this sale, about $1.1 million, was allocated to wildlife conservation.

Namibia is not the only country affected by the drought in southern Africa. Other countries in Eastern and Southern Africa have also been suffering from drought for several months. In Madagascar, the drought is causing enormous damage in the far south. According to a report published February 10, 2020, by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the Ministry of Agriculture of Madagascar, food reserves are almost exhausted, plunging some 500,000 people into a nutritional crisis. The FAO predicts that by March 2020, 730,000 people will be severely food insecure due to drought. This phenomenon is intensified by global warming.

The operation update reflects the current situation and information available – both affected by the Covid-19 circumstances. The first months of the operation were comprised of fundraising and preparatory activities to set up cash/voucher support for target households. Covid-19 containment measures, including lockdowns, border closures, movement and assembly restrictions as well as safety distancing protocols were instituted in all the four countries in late March 2020 following the declaration of a state of emergency in each country. The measures affected planned implementation, causing delays, but the National Societies have mostly found ways to adapt to the circumstances and have been able to advance despite them, while simultaneously undertaking large scale Covid-19 operations. The operational strategy has not been adapted per se due to Covid-19, changes have been made merely in practicalities, while the needs created by Covid-19 are addressed through the Covid-19 operation.

During the reporting period Botswana Red Cross Society carried out all the preparatory activities to start food distributions for 150 households, which were carried out in May 2020. The National Society had to change their implementation modality to in-kind food deliveries to the homes of households instead of voucher distributions due to national lockdown measures. Rains also improved pasture availability in the country easing pressure on the need of fodder distributions, allowing the Botswana Red Cross Society to focus on food distributions. Gardening support activities will be started in June 2020, based on a voucher modality.

Baphalali Eswatini Red Cross Society reached 2,300 households with mobile cash distributions by the end of May 2020 and was looking to continue distributions further distribution rounds to the same households in June 2020. Support to households establishing keyhole gardens is planned to start in June-July 2020. While initial plan is to carry these out through in-kind support, it is now foreseen to utilize cash/vouchers for them.

Lesotho Red Cross Society (LRCS) distributed already three rounds of mobile cash to 2,005 households by the end of May 2020. LRCS was looking to finalize its distribution rounds in June 2020 and then move on to support also gardening activities, implemented through vouchers.

Namibia Red Cross Society (NRCS) with the support of British Red Cross delegate carried out needs and cash feasibility assessment in the targeted Kunene region in March 2020. Based on the assessment, NRCS is looking to focus its intervention in one constituency instead of two, priorities being in water point rehabilitations and cash for basic needs more so than in gardening support. NRCS next steps are to carry out household identification and financial service provider procurement for the cash distributions.

Following fundraising efforts and partner engagement the Appeal has attracted CHF 2 033 199 funding and was 26,41% Covered at the time of reporting. The implementation rate at the end of May 2020 stands at CHF 1 290 056","The first months of the operation were comprised of fundraising and preparatory activities to set up cash/voucher support for target households.

Windhoek - At least three million people are at risk of contracting waterborne and water related diseases such as diarrhoea, cholera and malaria across the Southern African region, The Southern Times has learnt.

According to the Southern African Development Community (SADC) Secretariat, following the cyclones that severely affected people in Mozambique, Malawi, Zimbabwe and the Comoros, the population at risk was in need of clean water, proper sanitation and medical support.

“Access to healthcare has been disrupted as more than 50 health facilities were destroyed by the cyclones. The lack of access due to damaged road infrastructure and flooded areas impeded the provision of assistance to the affected communities,” said SADC Deputy Executive Eecretary for Regional Integration, Thembinkosi Mhlongo.

“Due to the severe and devastating impacts of the mentioned cyclones, about three million people require immediate humanitarian assistance, including food, shelter, clothing, potable water, sanitation and medical support, considering the threat for cholera and other diarrheal infections, malaria and water borne and water related diseases,” he said.

The effects of the cyclones on water and sanitation in SADC comes at a time where the region is already having limited access to safe drinking water and sanitation facilities which are key in the health and hygiene of the people.

According to the SADC Secretariat, out of the over 300million SADC population, approximately 60 percent has access to safe drinking water while approximately 40 percent has access to sanitation facilities.

Mhlongo said the undesirable record of limited access to safe water and sanitation in the region was a serious constraint on the regional efforts to roll-out water and sanitation infrastructure service.

He, however, noted that the Regional Infrastructure Development Master Plan and supporting strategies that the region had put in place were aiming at turning around the state of affairs, targeting to increase access levels to at least 75 percent for both safe drinking water and sanitation.

“The SADC Water Sector Regional Strategic Action Plan (RSAP) Phase IV 2016-2020 is the implementation plan for the water component of the revised Regional Indicative Strategic Development Plan (RISDP). The RSAP IV focus is on water infrastructure development to enhance water security and increase resilience against climate variability and change. The RSAP IV will come to an end in 2020, we therefore request your guidance and continuous support in designing the RSAP V. This will increase our capacity to store water resources to mitigate effects of dry seasons,” said Mhlongo.

The regional bloc is also hopeful that the initiative of SADC through the current Chairperson and Namibian President Hage Geingob to launch an appeal of US$323 million aimed at targeting 2 802 million people and 2 789 million in need will also be part of the solutions to the undesirable living conditions that came after the cyclones.

USAID, through its “Development Grants Program (DGP) initiative, complements the Government of the Republic of Angola (GRA) efforts to increase Angolan access to water by supporting community governance mechanisms that improve the management and operations of water systems. These efforts are embodied by USAID’s support in the roll out of the model of community management of water systems - MOGECA. This model is based on four fundamental principles: a) decentralized management of water systems; b) community participation; c) cost recovery; d) establishment of institutional partnership. The support aims to increase access to potable water at reasonable cost and increase access to improved sanitation and hygiene facilities. Through GDP, USAID also supported a program to improve access to water and sanitation services in primary schools that aimed to reduce the incidence of water-borne diseases that resulted in absenteeism, mostly among girls.

One reason is money earned by Angola’s oil industry. In 2017, business advisory service Mercer named the capital, Luanda, the most costly city for foreigners to live in.

But, many Luandans do not have access to even basic needs.

Luanda is surrounded on three sides by water: the Bengo and Cuanza Rivers and the Atlantic Ocean. Yet only half of its eight million people have access to clean, running water.

Many people in and around Angola’s capital must use untreated water for everyday activities – and even for work.

Car washers like Herminio Chitembo, for example, use untreated sewage water to earn a living.

Chitembo says he and other car washers do this kind of work for survival. They are unemployed — that is why they are here.

The United Nations Children’s Agency reports that nationwide, forty-four percent of Angolans still do not have access to clean water.

Agency representative Patricia Portela De Sousa says a lack of access to safe drinking water, sanitation systems and hygiene are the main causes of infectious diseases. She said this “means that many people are in danger.” Not having safe water, she added, equals a high chance of getting diseases and even dying.

Angolan officials are working to improve access. But the lack of clean water is a business opportunity for hundreds of young men. They bring drinking water to buyers across the city.

Eliseu André Paulo says people need this water because, in the neighborhood where they sell it, there is no water at all. There are water taps, but the taps have never had running water.

The United States Agency for International Development found that Angola has invested hundreds of millions of dollars in water and sanitation infrastructure in recent years. But continuous access to improved water and sanitation remains an issue.

The Public Water Company of Luanda, known as EPAL, admits there is a serious water shortage.

EPAL representative Vladimir Bernardo says Luanda’s water company has an average production level of 540,000 cubic meters of water per day. But the daily need is over a million cubic meters.

Luanda’s water company says financial issues have slowed progress, but its current infrastructure projects will soon improve access to clean water.

For now, Angolans do their best to survive, using the dirty water they have or the clean water they can sell.

By Marco Prates

ONDJIVA, Angola – Pedro Henrique Kassesso knows people can be a little skeptical when he tells them how old he is, so he doesn’t mind showing them the ID card bearing his date of birth.

According to the document, Pedro was born in 1907, a claim his neighbourhood coordinator confirms. So, when he says that the drought currently ravaging the area is the worst he has ever seen, it’s worth taking note.

“Water is the world’s boss,” the 112-year-old Pedro says. Unfortunately for large parts of southern Angola this year, it is also nowhere to be seen.

From bad to worse

An estimated 2.3 million people are affected by the ongoing drought in southern Angola’s Namibe, Huila, Bie and Cunene provinces, nearly half a million of whom are children under 5 years old.

The failure of this year’s rainy season in the first three months of the year decimated crops and livestock. In Cunene province alone, the number of people facing food insecurity more than tripled in the same time period, from almost 250,000 in January to more than 850,000 in March.

The water scarcity has also had a dangerous knock-on effect on children’s education.

During the dry season, men usually embark on the seasonal movement of their livestock, known as transhumance. In most cases, it is up to the children, women and the elderly who stay behind to fetch water for the family and take care of the household and smaller animals such as goats and chickens.

But the increasingly arduous journeys in search of water have left little time for school.

Of Cunene province’s 887 primary schools, 614 have been affected by the drought in some way, seriously disrupting the education of around 70 per cent of the province’s 214,000 students.

Rogério Kakoi, director of Ondobodhola Primary School, says that the drought is taking a toll on education even when children do make it to class.

“Students no longer have any energy and aren’t really learning much,” he says. “I have students who have to get up at 1 a.m. to take animals somewhere for water, and they don’t get back home until 5 a.m.”

It’s not surprising that 20 per cent of the school’s students have dropped out since the beginning of the year, or that physical education classes have been cancelled: there isn’t enough water to give to children who would be exercising.

Dreams running dry

As part of its efforts to reduce the impact of the drought, Cunene province will be providing 30 water tanks, each with a capacity of 5,000 litres, which will be placed at strategic locations in drought-affected communities to reduce the distances communities have to travel to fetch water.

The search for water

The daily reality in these southern provinces is a stark reminder of just how challenging it is to access water, even when a well is available.

Eighteen-year-old Tchirinho Vataleni's family shares a more than 15-metre deep well with five other families in Ombadja. Each day, he spends around four hours down a cold, dark hole using a bucket to remove enough soil from the bottom of the well to access water.

Tchirinho doesn’t have access to safety equipment either, so he climbs down with his bare hands. Sometimes, even a full day of digging doesn’t pay off. On bad days, there might only be enough for each family to take home a single bucket with 20 litres of water.

Ana Leonilde, 24, has experienced this very challenge herself. After spending more than three hours digging in a well, the clay walls started to collapse, forcing her to start all over again. “This water is bad, too salty,” she says. “But you have to keep fighting for water or you don’t drink or eat.”

UNICEF is supporting the Government of Angola’s response through child-centered ‘safe havens,’ including 'safe haven schools', which will focus on ensuring the most vulnerable communities can access integrated health, nutrition, water, sanitation and protection services. UNICEF is also leading the nutrition and water, sanitation and hygiene component of interventions funded by the UN Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF), with an estimated 341,565 children to be assisted in nutrition. So far, 58,217 have been screened, with 4,384 admitted into treatment with severe acute malnutrition.","An ongoing drought in southern Angola has left families desperate – and children with no time for an education.

Angola has launched two major projects to double the capacity of water supply to achieve a million cubic metres of water in Luanda.

“At the moment, we have approximately 430,000 cubic meters, which is not enough,” Joao Baptista Borges, Angola’s minister for energy and water said.

It is hard. It is not an easy journey. We have to wake up early in the morning. We then go to search for a place that has clean running water. We buy it from places that have running water in town.

Luandan inhabitants are speaking out against the phenomenon.

“It is hard. It is not an easy journey. We have to wake up early in the morning. We then go to search for a place that has clean running water. We buy it from places that have running water in town,” Adriano Correia, a water vendor in Luanda said.

“It is better to shut down the entire Luanda water system. Water is killing children. It is destroying Angolans. All Angolans will die because of the water problem! The water here is dirty. It is not good. It is a state crime,” another resident added.

The unsanitary conditions many poorer Angolans have to endure is not the reality in other areas of Luanda, which is one of the world’s most expensive cities for foreigners and home to generations of billionaire oil magnates and politicians.

The Angolan government has announced that it wants to invite the private sector to invest in power and water services.

“We cannot ensure, we cannot systematically ensure that water provided through the water supply networks to the population or to the water points is being tested regularly, systematically so in most cases water supply is not compliant with WHO standards, standards from the World Health Organization,” Thomas Lopez Bufala, Head of water and sanitation, UNICEF Angola said.

Angola’s budget is forty percent lower than two years ago, as it grapples with low global crude prices.

Angolan officials recently announced that it needed about 29 billion dollars which will enable it meet its development targets by 2025.

The project was made public on the 5th of March 2020 by João Baptista Borges, the Angolan Minister of Energy and Water. This was during the opening ceremony of the tenth Water Sector Advisory Council. The research centres will help improve the quality of drinking water distributed to the population.

The laboratories will make it possible to carry out a complete analysis of the water to detect impurities. They will also make it possible to characterise water from distribution networks, groundwater, wells, etc.

In addition to the construction of the water treatment research laboratories, João Baptista Borges, Angola’s Minister of Energy and Water, announced the installation of drinking water supply systems (DWS) in 15 of the country’s municipalities. These are the municipalities of Jamba, Cahama, Bula Tumba, Rivungo, Lubalo, Chitato, Xá – Muteba, Cuilo, Balombo e Bocoio, Muxaluando, Landana, Muxima, Cangandala, Marimba Quela and Camucuio.

Improving the supply of drinking water

The Angolan government invested more than €436 million (almost 246 billion Angolan kwanzas) in October 2019 to improve the supply of drinking water in several provinces of Angola. For example, a dam is being built on the Kunene River, which has its source in Angola and ends its course in the Atlantic Ocean through northern Namibia. A water pumping station will be built in the reservoir.

The facility, which will be built in the southern province of Kunene, will be equipped with a pipeline and a canal between the locality of Cafu and that of Cuamato. It is being built by Sinohydro. The Chinese state-owned company will also build 10 water reservoirs in Kunene province. The value of the contract obtained by the Chinese giant for the Kunene dam amounts to approximately €57.4 million (about 3.3 billion Angolan kwanzas). The provinces of Luanda, Benguela, Malanje, Moxico, Kwanza Norte, Uíge and Huíla are also affected by the project. The various facilities are expected to provide drinking water to 7.5 million people.

Empresa Publica de Aguas de Luanda (Epal), which provides the public drinking water service in Luanda, has signed a contract for the construction of the Bita drinking water plant with a consortium formed by the French group Suez in partnership with two Portuguese companies: Mota Engil, a Portuguese construction company, and Soares da Costa, a civil construction company based in Porto.

Suez’s share in this major contract is €98 million. The company, based in Paris, France, is responsible for building a water intake in the Kwanza River, which passes near the capital Luanda before flowing into the Atlantic Ocean. The pipe will carry raw water to a drinking water plant that Suez will build in Bita, a town 40 km southeast of Luanda. The facility will have a daily capacity of 260,000 cubic metres, making it one of the largest drinking water plants on the African continent.

Strengthening the water supply in Luanda

According to Suez, this important Bita plant will meet the drinking water needs of Luanda’s rapidly growing population of 7.5 million, while supporting the capital’s economic development. The group has 39 months to complete its contract. Once the facility is commissioned, it will be required to provide operational support over a nine-month period.

“In addition to carrying out engineering studies, supplying equipment, assembly and commissioning of the plant, Suez will be responsible for training local teams in Epal to ensure long-term operation. The plant will integrate Suez technologies such as PulsatubeTM and Aquazur® V to guarantee the production of excellent quality water”, says Suez. The group, which employs 90,000 people worldwide, believes that these two technologies reduce the plant’s environmental footprint thanks to their compactness, optimize the treatment of micropollutants and organic matter, and are easy to use.

Funding from several development partners

In addition to the construction of the plant, the Bita drinking water supply project also includes the laying of 82 km of water pipes to supply four new distribution lines in targeted peri-urban service areas south of the capital Luanda that are currently not supplied. These are Cabolombo, Mundial, Ramiros and Bita. The main lines will also be extended to supply two existing but undersupplied distribution centres in the suburbs of Luanda. As a result, the communes of Camama and Benfica will soon no longer be supplied by tankers.

The Bita drinking water supply project is financed by the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (Bird), a subsidiary of the World Bank Group, and by Bpifrance, a French public body for financing and business development.

This will take place as soon as the state of emergency in force in the country due to Covid-19 is lifted.

The dam restoration project is part of the Integrated Municipal Intervention Programme (PIIM). Among other things, this plan will make it possible to improve the distribution of drinking water in the town of Camacupa. “We will build a system for the collection, treatment and distribution of drinking water for the communities,” says Pereira Alfredo, Governor of Bié.

Work on the restoration of the Cunje I hydroelectric dam is resuming after an interruption of more than three years due to a lack of funding. The renovated infrastructure is expected to improve access to electricity in Bié province. Until 1992, the dam provided electricity to the local communities of Catabola, Camacupa and Cuito. It had been destroyed during the armed conflict in Angola, leaving the communities in darkness and precarious conditions.

In addition to the project to restore the Camacupa hydroelectric dam, the country also plans to diversify its electricity mix, which is largely dominated by fossil fuels, including oil.

The Angolan government has recently agreed with the Namibian government to launch the construction of the Baynes dam on the Cunene River, which serves as the natural border between Angola and Namibia, in 2021. To this end, the energy ministers of the two countries issued a call for tenders to select the company that will build the future dam and its hydroelectric power station.

270,https://borgenproject.org/water-access-in-angola/,Water Access in Angola: The Value of Investment,"Almost half the population in Angola does not have proper access to clean water according to a report by UNICEF.

A country endowed with some of Africa’s most precious natural resources, Angola is frequently victim to external shocks to the market. Oil accounts for roughly one-third of GDP and more than 95 percent of exports. Reliance on a market like oil, which is particularly prone to shocks, means that Angola’s economy is directly affected by external fluctuations. In fact, growth in GDP continues to fall years after a drop in oil prices in 2014. According to the World Bank, annual GDP growth in 2018 was -2.1 percent.

At-Risk Populations

Water access in Angola is an important metric in understanding the distortionary economic effects felt by low-income individuals, women and children. Without clean water and sanitation, too many Angolans are more prone to water-borne diseases like cholera which can kill someone within hours if left untreated.

Outbreaks are more common in rainy seasons when it is easy for the cholera bacteria to survive. Between February and August of 2018, there were 1,046 cases of cholera in Angola, including 21 deaths.

Programs and Initiatives that Increase Water Access in Angola

Luanda, Angola’s capital city, has a population of 7 million, 37 percent of whom rely on connected water service. Private tanker truck services account for 25 percent, public standpipes for 22 percent and illegal water connections or untreated river sources for 16 percent. Increased water access in Angola will contribute directly to labor productivity, economic growth, reduced vulnerability and an overall reduction in poverty.

The valuation of water is incredibly unique—at high quantities, it is an elastic good, but at low quantities it is inelastic. Simply put, it is a basic resource, so when water is unavailable it also becomes invaluable. Investment in water projects can help Angolans reduce time and money spent on acquiring water—especially from tanker truck services which tend to take advantage of the inelasticity of water during a shortage. A number of global organizations are working to increase water access in Angola in order to help provide people with this basic human right.

USAID Development Grants Program

From 2016-2017, the Development Grants Program focused specifically on water and sanitation in Angola. It strived to create affordable water options for consumers, and increase the maintenance of infrastructure. Initiatives such as this help local people reliably manage public resources.

The Institutional and Sustainability Support program began in 2015 to support urban water supply and sanitation services. It proposed infrastructure and development goals with the intention of helping 4.5 million people in seven provinces. This program is ongoing and specifically focuses on those provinces with the highest need for water services: Cabinda, Lunda Norte, Lunda Sul, Kuanza Sul, Bengo, Namib and Cunene.

The World Bank Projects

The most recent World Bank project supports inclusive growth, social protection and water services in Angola. One of its 2019 programs, called the Luanda Bita Water Supply Project, invested $500 million to mobilize government financing for clean water access. Another $500 million was given specifically to protect the poor and vulnerable.

This project comes after a 2017 loan of $200 million to provide 950,000 individuals with piped water services and a 2018 investment of $150 million for the 1.2 million people living in regional cities of Angola.

Women and girls are the focus of many of these investments since reducing their time spent collecting water will allow them to give back to the economy in more productive and impactful ways.

Support from these and other global organizations will help Angola to lower the risk of contracting water-borne illnesses, decrease time spent by women and children collecting water and positively impact the overall economy as a result. A basic resource such as water is often taken for granted by people living in countries with reliable water infrastructure. For those living in Angola who spend a disproportionate amount of time and money on safe water, investments in infrastructure and water supply programs are incredibly impactful. Providing the appropriate resources to aid in water access will help Angolans protect themselves from economic shocks, and give back to the global economy.

271,https://www.clovekvtisni.cz/en/building-resilience-through-access-to-water-in-angola-6037gp,Building Resilience Through Access to Water in Angola,"Up until last year, it was extremely difficult for members of the community to access water. Thankfully, People in Need (PIN), with the support of the Embassy of the Czech Republic in Pretoria and UNICEF, built a water pump to make water access more available for all. “They used to fetch water far from here, about two or three kilometres away in a place that has no safety or hygiene. It represented a risk to women and children, so we tried to reduce those risks by helping the community get water in a place that’s more nearby,” explains Gift Zuze, People in Need’s Project Officer for Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH). In rural Angolan communities, the women are the ones responsible for providing water for their families. The community well is especially useful because it helps reduce the burden placed on women.

Social mobilisers are trained to carry out maintenance and keep the water point functioning throughout the year. Kassova’s husband, Gabriel Lossati Luanda, is one of those mobilisers. He points out the benefits of having water near the houses. “It was a hardship when the women had to fetch water from the river. Since the water pump is here, they aren’t tired anymore, and we have water even during the dry season,” says Gabriel Lossati.



Safe water for Open Defecation Free villages

“This village was in terrible condition. People used to defecate in the open air and they were frequently ill. This is why we decided that this location should be part of the Community-Led Total Sanitation (CLTS) programme,” says Zuze, mentioning that the CLTS method uses participatory tools to get communities to reflect on their health situation, particularly on the impacts of outdoor defecation on public health and the environment.



In total, 18 villages were selected to be part of the water project, after they’ve achieved the status of Open Defecation Free, which means that their sanitation and hygiene patterns have improved. The work to end open defecation combined with the access to safe water also helps to improve health in communities. “When we didn’t have enough water, children used to always get diarrhoea, vomit a lot or have a high fever, but now these [symptoms] are diminishing,” says Lossati.



“When we began the project, we went from house to house to talk to the villagers, so that they all had a latrine. As soon as we finished this part, we started with the water points,” adds Lossati, explaining that having a safe, accessible and functional water source in the village served as an incentive for the community to achieve the Open Defecation Free status.

BUILDING RESILIENCE THROUGH ACCESS TO WATER IN ANGOLA Date: Sep 16, 2019 Place: Angola Author: Claudia de Oliveira More

Community committees are managing water points

The local residents actively participate in the project. “They contributed to the building work of the water pump and are responsible for maintaining it. In each selected village, PIN supports the creation of a Water and Sanitation Committee that will be in charge of the technical and financial management of the water point,” says Zuze.



The members of those groups are trained on the Community Water Management Model, an approach adopted by the Angolan government that focus on the involvement of local groups as the cornerstone for promoting local development. The committee is elected by the community: a coordinator, responsible for presenting the needs of the community to local authorities, members in charge of the technical part – construction or repair of the water point – finance members – who plan and administer the expenses related to the water point maintenance – and mobilizers – that promote a behaviour change concerning hygiene and sanitation.

The process for nominating water committee members takes gender balance into consideration, so that women can be represented, as well.

Contributing to sustainable management of natural resources

The main objective of the project is to contribute to resilience building in the communities, and as a result, to a sustainable economic growth and sustainable management of natural resources. “In order to ensure socio-economic development and resilient populations, it is essential to establish sustainable access to clean water,” explains Zuze.



In Angola, communities most at-risk to the effects of climate change often rely on deep ground water sources to have water, even during drought season. However, these deep sources require complex water scheme technology, and external support for repair. To overcome those obstacles, we use our experience in the water and sanitation sector to produce detailed training courses and materials about manual drilling and maintenance of pumps.

Nos dias ruins, a dupla regressa com apenas um balde de 20 litros para o consumo de todos da casa, 12 pessoas – uma média de menos de dois litros para cada um, divididos entre o preparo da comida e bebida.

Na 3ª classe do ensino primário, Marta mantém-se na escola, que é próxima de casa. Mas três dos seus irmãos já abandonaram os estudos: precisariam de mais água para vencerem a caminhada de ida e volta até a escola, no município sede de Ombala-Yo-Mungo.

Resposta

O UNICEF está a apoiar o Governo de Angola e o Governo Provincial do Cunene na resposta à seca, que atinge outras províncias no sul do país como o Namibe, a Huíla e o Bié.

O suporte baseia-se na entrega de serviços integrados nas áreas de água e saneamento, saúde, nutrição e protecção da criança. Na educação, as intervenções do UNICEF beneficiarão em torno de duas mil crianças em 15 escolas, que vão operar como escolas “Porto Seguro”, que fornecem um pacote de outros serviços, incluindo nutrição. Além disso, haverá a busca por alunos fora do sistema de ensino nessas comunidades e a doação de materiais escolares, incluindo tendas.

Quinhentas crianças vão ser beneficiadas ainda com o projecto de educação comunitária pré-escolar “Todos Unidos pela Primeira Infância” (TUPPI).

Contudo, o financiamento da componente de Educação em emergências do UNICEF permanece insuficiente face aos desafios enfrentados por 150 mil alunos no Cunene. A medida que os efeitos da seca se tornam ainda mais severos nas próximas semanas e meses, sem o devido fortalecimento das intervenções no terreno, existe a possibilidade de que mais crianças sejam privadas do direito de aceder à uma educação de qualidade.","Para a família de Marta Ndimaoshitya, 12 anos, o impacto da seca tem sido severo.

The approved package will finance the following three projects:

Growth and Inclusion Development Policy Operation, a $500 million loan to support the Government of Angola to achieve more sustainable and inclusive growth by strengthening the macro-financial and institutional environment and protecting the poor and vulnerable. Luanda Bita Water Supply Project, a $500 million guarantee aimed at improving access to clean water service in selected areas of Luanda by mobilizing commercial financing for the Government. Strengthening the National Social Protection System Project (Cash Transfer), a $320 million loan to provide temporary income support to poor households in selected areas of Angola and strengthen the delivery mechanisms for a permanent social safety net system.

The Angolan economy is at a critical point as it moves from a growth model based on oil wealth, which has left the country highly vulnerable to external shocks, to one that is more open and inclusive. These three projects support the government in its ambitious and urgent development strategy.

The Growth and Inclusion Development Policy program supports the government as it establishes a more stable macro-financial and institutional environment and promotes greater social and financial inclusion. The program supports efforts to improve debt and natural resource management, strengthen the management and commercial viability of state-owned enterprises, reform pricing and subsidies, and lay the foundations for private-sector led economic diversification. It also supports initiatives to improve financial and social inclusion by protecting the poor and vulnerable from shocks and increasing access to finance. These reforms are expected to make the country more resilient, raise investor confidence, and foster fiscal sustainability and private-sector-led growth over the medium-term.

The Bita Water Supply Project Guarantee will improve access to clean water service by mobilizing commercial financing for the Government. The first phase consists of investments in water production, transmission, storage and distribution including a water treatment plant with a production capacity of 3 cubic meters per second, 72km of gravity transmission pipelines towards Luanda, and storage and distribution systems in the suburban districts of Bita, Cabolombo, Mundial and Ramiros. The Bita Project will initially bring new or improved piped water service to an estimated 1 million people in the fast growing unserved urban and peri-urban belts of south Luanda, with capacity to serve up to two million people in the coming years.

Only about 37% of Luanda’s 7 million people benefit from connected service from the network, while another 22% get water from public standpipes. The rest relies on unregulated and extremely costly private tanker truck service (25%), or consume water drawn from illegal connections or from untreated river sources (16%). The project is expected to substantially improve living conditions by providing reliable connected potable water service to users, displacing and reducing unsafe and expensive tanker truck service, thereby reducing water supply coping costs, and enhancing public health. The project will also help scale-up enterprise reform in the water sector by supporting performance improvements at Empresa Pública de Águas de Luanda E.P. (EPAL), Angola’s largest water utility, which is state-owned.

The Strengthening the National Social Protection System Project will help ensure that the social safety net helps poor people become more resilient to economic shocks and provides opportunities for them to strengthen their human capital and reach their full potential. The project employs a two-track approach— a short-term cash transfer program to mitigate the impact of subsidy reforms on the poorest 40% of households and medium-term investments to strengthen the delivery mechanisms for a permanent social safety net system. Long-term, the project will help establish the foundation for a shift from universal, inefficient price subsidies towards poverty-targeted cash-based safety nets to better fit the needs of a young population that will require more and better investments in health, education, and skills for the future.”

“We are very happy to support Angola in its reform agenda by supporting better public spending, bringing water services to underserved population in Luanda, and also ensuring that the poor and vulnerable are protected against adverse shocks.

The project aims to improve water sector governance, strengthen institutional capacity and efficiency in the water and sanitation sector institutions at central and provincial level, and improve access to sustainable water supply and sanitation services. The project’s main outcomes include (i) the establishment and effective functioning of seven Provincial Water Supply and Sanitation Utilities, which are autonomous; (ii) enhanced capacity for service provision at the central and provincial levels; and (iii) expanded access to water supply and sanitation. The project is planned to be implemented over a 60-month period at a cost of US $154.71 million of total budget.

It is located in seven provinces namely: Cabinda, Cunene, Lunda Norte, Lunda Sul, Namibe, Bengo, and Cuanza Sul. Access stands at 54% for water supply and 60% for sanitation nationally as at 2012. The majority (85% or six out of the seven provinces) has coverage below the national average (ranging from 7% to 56%).

The Project will directly benefit 922,000 people and ultimately the 2.3-million urban population of the seven provinces through improved management and service delivery. It will increase access to water supply for an additional 338,000 people in peri-urban areas of the provincial capitals and an additional 75,000 people who would have access to safe wastewater infrastructure.

Angola has been investing heavily in infrastructure following three decades of conflict and has made progress in many areas including water supply and sanitation services. However, the investment in physical infrastructure has not been matched with adequate emphasis in the institutional and capacity domains. Lack of capacity and appropriate institutional mechanisms has negatively impacted the sustainability of existing investment. Service delivery is erratic and inefficient and highly subsidized with no cost recovery mechanisms in place. As a result of inefficient service delivery, the poor and vulnerable are the most affected in the peri-urban areas. Recognizing these needs, the government through its National Strategic Program for Water (2013-2017) and the Energy and Water Action Plan (2013-2017) in putting emphasis on the improvement of sector governance (establishing a water regulator and asset management entity) and professionalizing service delivery (establishing corporatized and autonomous utilities) along with critical investment to further expand access to services.

The Bank’s intervention will leverage investments made by the government and other partners. Its holistic approach combining investment with developing capacity and strengthening institutions would enhance sustainability. The synergetic value addition for reforms and capacity building through the recently approved Bank’s Power Sector Reform Support Program is significantly high and would promote the momentum for change.","The Board of Directors of the African Development Bank Group (AfDB) on Wednesday, April 1, 2015 approved a US $123.77-million loan to the Republic of Angola to finance the country’s Institutional and Sustainability Support to Urban Water Supply and Sanitation Service Delivery Project.

Luanda, Angola - Over the last three years, some 400,000 Angolans living in the capital, Luanda, and in the western province of Moxico have improved access to clean water and sanitation facilities through a combined boost to infrastructure building and water sector management capacity.

This is part of the United Nations Development Programme’s (UNDP) overall effort to support the authorities put in place an effective water and sanitation system, through legislation and decentralisation of public service delivery, while ensuring community involvement and local ownership.

To lay the groundwork for future work in this sector, UNDP has helped develop a draft national policy on sanitation, the country’s first such legislative document in this area, which is with parliament for approval.

UNDP is also currently providing technical support to the authorities to develop a national strategy on solid waste - one of the capital’s most pressing problems - as well as a research study on water prices in the country to help inform the first ever regulation policy in the sector.

To improve the local authorities’ capacity to manage service delivery, more than 100 water and sanitation officials have been trained in water governance issues, including planning and data collection, and they are already working with municipalities and communities to improve water sector management.

With UNDP support, Luanda’s Kilamba Kiaxi municipality, with more than 200,000 inhabitants, is now one of the first in the country to establish and manage its own water and sanitation database system – a key tool for planning and monitoring water services. In municipal staff have been trained on sectoral planning tools and methodologies, and have been able to develop their own first Water and Sanitation Master Plan.

To ensure that the policy is moving along with service provision, UNDP, together with other UN agencies, has been working with the authorities and other partners to set up small and medium-sized water utilities owned and managed by local communities, who also maintain the water treatment facilities to ensure they remain functional.

Previously, communities either drew water from contaminated rivers - exposing them to water borne illnesses such as choler - or paid high prices for poor quality water from private vendors.

As part of the programme, extensive advocacy on hygiene and sanitation at the community level, led by the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) has resulted in more awareness about maintaining healthy water points where communities collect their water, helping to reduce the risk of water-borne diseases.","Angola: Improved water governance boosts access to clean waterLuanda, Angola - Over the last three years, some 400,000 Angolans living in the capital, Luanda, and in the western province of Moxico have improved access to clean water and sanitation facilities through a combined boost to infrastructure building and water sector management capacity.

280,https://www.idrc.ca/en/research-in-action/improving-water-security-and-reducing-climate-risk-angolas-coastal-cities,Improving water security and reducing climate risk in Angola’s coastal cities,"Development Workshop Angola

Millions of people fled Angola’s rural areas for coastal cities during the country’s 27-year civil war. Most settled on environmentally fragile land on the urban periphery: low-lying coastal zones, floodplains, and steep ravines susceptible to flooding and landslides. Today more than half of Angola’s 31 million people live in urban coastal settlements and floodplains that are vulnerable to climatic events.

Municipal officials in these areas confront two major challenges: providing adequate water supply and safe housing to their war-displaced populations, and adapting to more frequent and intense climate-related extremes. These challenges are complicated by the fact that 98% of the country's meteorological stations — and their rich climate data records — were destroyed during the war.

Between 2012 and 2014, IDRC supported the non-governmental organization Development Workshop Angola to address this massive data gap. Working closely with city planners, policymakers, and vulnerable communities, Development Workshop Angola carried out research in the coastal cities of Luanda, Cabinda, and the twin cities of Benguela/Lobito. Together they identified the most vulnerable communities, where natural hazards are most likely to occur, and how a changing climate may exacerbate these problems.

Determining climate risk and variability

Researchers developed a national climate database from archives and oral histories that reconstructs close to 30 years of meteorological data lost during the war. The database provides a better understanding of past weather patterns and present-day and future projections of climate change risks. It demonstrates that the intensity and variability of climatic events (such as rainstorms and floods) has more than doubled in Angola’s coastal cities over the last 60 years.

Participatory community risk mapping

The research team used satellite images and participatory research methods to develop detailed maps of the climate-related risks threatening the four coastal cities — including flooding, erosion, sea-level rise, storm surges, and saltwater intrusion. The team went door-to-door to conduct household surveys in affected communities and held focus group discussions to validate the data. The research showed that engaging communities and municipal authorities directly more readily identifies actions that respond to specific local challenges, thereby reducing vulnerability.

Municipal officials are using the risk maps to guide urban planning and identify where action is needed to safeguard communities. For example, the maps revealed that over 12% of households in Luanda were at risk of flooding, coastal inundation, and erosion. In the other three cities, 40-50% of the population were living without adequate access to clean water, resulting in frequent cases of malaria, diarrhea, and cholera due to poor sanitation and scarce, polluted water.

Development Workshop Angola

Flood risk planning and response

Researchers worked with the Climate Change section of the National Environment Directorate to establish an early flood warning system in southwest Angola. This involved collecting data from remotely operated flood gauges and sharing it with the Department for Civil Protection to assist with flood planning and response. In 2015 and 2016, Development Workshop Angola worked with the Ministries of Environment and Territorial Administration in Benguela and Lobito to advise on projected storm and flood risks ahead of major storms. A combination of near real-time satellite imagery and the results of the preliminary risk assessments were applied to track the approaching storms, warn communities, and evacuate hundreds of families. These extreme events highlight the importance of risk assessments, municipal risk maps, and early warning systems to inform action to safeguard communities.

Improved water availability and affordability

The most important outcome of the research for Angola's vulnerable urban populations is more available and affordable water at the household level. In three Luanda neighbourhoods, consumers elected water caretakers to create water associations that collect user fees, manage maintenance, and buy water in bulk from the parastatal provincial water companies. The result was greater access to clean water and a 90% cost reduction. The approach ensures that locally elected committees finance the maintenance of water points by collecting fees for services and take an active role in promoting hygiene and basic sanitation. The model was incorporated into the government’s “Water for All” policy and has been replicated across the country.

Development Workshop Angola

Lasting effects

The evidence base and lessons generated through this IDRC-funded research helped Development Workshop Angola secure additional funding to work in two more coastal cities (Soyo and Namibe), where they are mapping climate risks and developing local adaptation strategies to enhance urban resilience. Development Workshop Angola has also been liaising with the National Department for Urban Resilience (established in 2018) to share data from the project and to ensure its use. In recognition of their expertise, the Angolan government has asked Development Workshop Angola to provide support in developing a national climate change strategy and action plan.","Development Workshop AngolaMillions of people fled Angola’s rural areas for coastal cities during the country’s 27-year civil war.

286,https://www.hrw.org/news/2013/11/19/zimbabwe-water-and-sanitation-crisis,Zimbabwe: Water and Sanitation Crisis,"(Harare) – The water and sanitation crisis in Zimbabwe’s capital, Harare, places millions of residents at risk of waterborne disease, Human Rights Watch said in a report released today. Five years after cholera killed over 4,000 people and sickened 100,000 more, the conditions that allowed the epidemic to flourish persist in Harare’s high-density suburbs.

The 60-page report, “Troubled Water: Burst Pipes, Contaminated Wells, and Open Defecation in Zimbabwe’s Capital,” describes how residents have little access to potable water and sanitation services, and often resort to drinking water from shallow, unprotected wells that are contaminated with sewage, and to defecating outdoors. The conditions violate their right to water, sanitation, and health. The report is based on research conducted in 2012 and 2013 in Harare, including 80 interviews with residents, mostly women, in eight high-density suburbs.

“Harare’s water and sanitation system is broken and the government isn’t fixing it,” said Tiseke Kasambala, Southern Africa director at Human Rights Watch. “In many communities there is no water for drinking or bathing, there is sewage in the streets, there is diarrhea and typhoid and the threat of another cholera epidemic.”

Many residents said that the lack of household water forced them to wait for water at boreholes for up to five hours a day, and that violence frequently erupted when lines were especially long. People believe these boreholes – 200 of which were drilled by international agencies during the cholera epidemic – are the safest water option available, yet one-third of boreholes tested in Harare by Harare Water, the city agency in charge of water, showed contamination.

Residents also said that the city charged them for municipal water even when the water flowed only sporadically or was contaminated. If people were unable to pay their bills, the city turned off their water supply.

Some residents described raw sewage flowing into their homes and streets from burst pipes, in which children frequently played. The water shortage and the lack of functioning indoor toilets or community latrines sometimes gave them no choice but to defecate outdoors.

One mother told Human Rights Watch: “We have one toilet for the whole house and there are 21 people who live here. The flushing system doesn’t work because there is no water, so we have to use buckets. When there isn’t any water for flushing we just use the bush.”

Corruption and mismanagement at the local and national levels of government exacerbate the situation, Human Rights Watch said. For example, city budget guidelines specify that most of the revenue from water must be ploughed back into the system for maintenance and improvement, but even government officials acknowledged that the money is diverted for other uses. As a result, key parts of the service delivery system, like purchasing water treatment chemicals, are not adequately funded, leading the city to produce less potable water.

Until the late 1980s, Zimbabwe had a functioning water system, with access to potable water for 85 percent of the population. In Harare, remnants of this system are visible in a complex piped water and sewage system to which many residents are connected. The piped infrastructure has not been maintained, however. The result of deterioration of the system combined with a significant increase in the population is that the water now runs only sporadically and is often contaminated.

“Everyone has a right to access a minimum amount of potable water,” Kasambala said. “The government’s inability to maintain the water system and its practice of disconnecting those unable to pay forces people to drink water from contaminated taps or from unprotected wells.”

The government should take a number of steps to improve Harare’s water and sanitation crisis, including investing in low-cost sanitation and water strategies. These include providing community toilets and pit latrines, and drilling and maintaining boreholes so that residents do not have to rely on contaminated sources. A sliding fee scale for municipal water should be put in place to provide affordable water for low-income families, and no home should be disconnected from the city water supply for lack of payment.

Earlier in 2013, the government announced a US$144 million loan from the Chinese government, with 46 Chinese engineers coming to Harare, to upgrade the water infrastructure primarily by improving the sewage treatment plants. While the government has promoted the loan as the solution to Harare’s water crisis, its terms have not been made public. Critics have decried the loan as exemplifying the lack of transparency and corruption in water and sewage services.

The government of Zimbabwe is obliged under international law to protect the right to water and sanitation, Human Rights Watch said. In 2010, Zimbabwe voted for a United Nations General Assembly resolution establishing the right to water and sanitation. The recognition of this right acknowledges that water and sanitation are crucial not only for health, but also for other key aspects of development, such as gender equality, education and economic growth. Zimbabwe’s constitution and domestic laws protect the right to water and, through protections concerning the environment, the right to sanitation. In May, Zimbabwe ratified a new constitution that includes an explicit right to water.

“Harare’s water and sanitation system has been destroyed by decades of neglect and by ongoing mismanagement and corruption,” Kasambala said. “The 2008 cholera epidemic was a visible catastrophe, but less visible suffering, deaths, and indignity continue.”","“Harare’s water and sanitation system is broken and the government isn’t fixing it,” said Tiseke Kasambala, Southern Africa director at Human Rights Watch.

Abigail Chomo, a widow, lives in a small brick house with her three children in Dzivarasekwa, a working class suburb west of Harare, Zimbabwe’s capital. She used to have four children. In November 2012, her youngest daughter, Helen, contracted typhoid fever at age 4, probably from drinking contaminated water. Although typhoid fever is treatable with antibiotics, Helen was also HIV positive and had a weak immune system, and died.

Abigail’s daughter was not the only family member who died from a waterborne disease. Four years earlier, her mother was one of an estimated 4,200 people in Zimbabwe to die from cholera. With prompt and proper treatment, cholera, like typhoid, can have a mortality rate below 1 percent. Without prompt treatment, however, mortality rates can soar. The Zimbabwean government’s response to the cholera outbreak was characterized by denial, neglect, and cover-up. Overall, between 2008 and 2009, 100,000 people in the country fell ill with cholera. It was Africa’s worst cholera epidemic in 15 years.

Children are particularly vulnerable to waterborne disease. In Zimbabwe, diarrhea is responsible for 10 percent of deaths of children under the age of five. Access to potable drinking water and appropriate sanitation can prevent waterborne diseases, including typhoid, cholera, and diarrhea.

Today, the same conditions that allowed the 2008-09 cholera epidemic to flourish—poor sanitation, high-density living conditions, lack of access to potable water, official denial of the magnitude of the problem, and lack of information about the safety of the public water supply —persist. Corruption, which has a negative impact on water governance globally, appears on the rise in Zimbabwe. In 2012, Transparency International ranked Zimbabwe the 13th most corrupt country in the world, a slip from its 2008 rank as 24th. According to the group, “When corruption leads to contaminated drinking water and destroyed ecosystems, the detrimental consequences are often irreversible.”

The risk of another cholera outbreak in Harare is significant and the number of people sick from lack of access to potable water and sanitation is startling; in the past year there have been over 3,000 typhoid cases reported in Harare alone. Healthcare workers believe the actual number of people infected is much higher. According to the World Bank, the amount of municipal water available in Harare has dropped to the levels recorded during the cholera epidemic. The risk of another public health crisis cannot be discounted.

For people in Harare—and around the world, the denial of the right to water and sanitation has a significant impact on the realization of other fundamental human rights. Water and sanitation access are closely tied to the rights to life and to health. When lack of water and sanitation prevents children from attending school, the right to education suffers. The rights to participation and information, particularly for women and vulnerable groups, go hand and hand with ensuring equitable access to water, and are often violated by governments and policy makers. These links between water and sanitation rights and many other basic rights are increasingly acknowledged – most notably in authoritative commentary by UN experts. Upholding the rights to water and sanitation is necessary for demonstrating respect for human rights more broadly.

Human Rights Watch investigated the availability of potable water and sanitation in Harare between September 2012 and October 2013. We conducted 80 interviews in eight high-density areas in Harare and found a city with a considerable proportion of its population living in desperate and dangerous conditions.

Our specific findings include: 1) the government’s failure to provide access to potable water, 2) its failure to provide adequate health information, 3) the government’s inability to address poor sanitation, and 4) public sector corruption and a lack of political will at all levels of government to address these problems.

Failure to Provide Access to Potable Water

Although many houses in Harare have the infrastructure for piped water, residents reported that water flow into homes was inconsistent, and sometimes as rare as a few hours every two weeks. The infrastructure for piped water in the capital was developed before Zimbabwe’s independence in 1980, when the population was about 600,000. The city’s population is nearly four million today. Old, unmaintained pipes and leaks in both the water and sewage system mean that tap water that does flow can be mixed with sewage. Several residents told Human Rights Watch that adults and children were drinking the tap water even when it smelled bad and they believed it caused diarrhea. To completely replace this piped infrastructure would require US$5 to 6 billion.

People rely on water from boreholes—narrow shafts drilled into the ground—many of which are contaminated. Women and children, frequently the ones in the family responsible for going to the borehole, often have to wait up to five hours to collect water. Some Harare residents who spoke to Human Rights Watch said they often had to collect water from shallow, unprotected wells they dig themselves. Shallows wells are susceptible to sewage and other groundwater contamination.

Failure to Provide Health Information

Despite Harare’s water crisis and the known risk of drinking contaminated water, there appears to be little or no specific official information on safe water sources.

Residents said that health clinics and donor agencies gave them mixed and inconsistent messages about water safety, sometimes giving away free water-cleaning tablets though typically not making clear if they were for tap, borehole or well water. People told Human Rights Watch that it was not clear if the water had become safe to drink when the clinics stopped handing them out.

Likewise, some residents told Human Rights Watch they occasionally heard from healthcare workers or through government statements on the radio or in the newspapers that they should boil water, but they were not sure if that meant tap or borehole water. Also, because of the sporadic supply of electricity and its high cost, people said that boiling water was often not a realistic option.

During the cholera epidemic, donor and United Nations agencies and international nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) drilled over 200 boreholes in areas around Harare to provide safe drinking water. While those boreholes provided a needed source of potable water four years ago, they have not been maintained and many are now contaminated. Although some residents believed that boreholes were a safe water source because they were drilled by international organizations, a January 2013 study by Harare Water found that one-third of boreholes tested were contaminated.

Poor Sanitation

Having to defecate outdoors jeopardizes people’s health, dignity, economic development and safety. Poor sanitation practices, including open defecation, lack of water for hand washing, and open sewers, lead to outbreaks of waterborne disease such as cholera and typhoid in communities. The lack of sanitary toilets is one of the principal contributors to childhood diarrhea, a major killer of children under 5 in Africa.

For people who lack access to sanitary toilets, open defecation also has an impact on personal dignity and safety, with women and girls facing particular challenges. As they move farther away from crowded areas in order to have privacy, they are more at risk for physical attacks and sexual violence. The lack of sanitary toilets in schools also impacts girls’ ability to receive education. Without a clean and private area to use, many girls are unable to attend school while menstruating.

Despite government statistics pointing to a low rate of open defecation in urban areas, people we interviewed said they often resorted to open defecation because they were unable to flush their toilets as a result of lack of water, or their toilets were clogged and overflowing, rending the toilets unusable.

Open sewers and flowing sewage are common sights in the suburbs of Harare, posing significant health risks. In addition to contaminating nearby water sources, such as wells, the concentration of human waste attracts flies and other disease vectors. Flies flourish in areas with poor sanitation, contributing to the spread of a number of diseases, including cholera and typhoid, but also trachoma, a disease of the eye that causes permanent blindness and affects 40 million people worldwide, including in Zimbabwe.

Contributing to a poor sanitation environment is an inadequate system for refuse disposal. Refuse piled up on the street, especially refuse that contains human waste such as dirty diapers, also acts as a breeding ground for various types of diseases.

Public Sector Corruption , Mismanagement and Lack of Political Will

Along with an old and crumbling infrastructure that is inadequate for the population of Harare, public sector corruption, mismanagement and lack of political will severely hamper efforts to improve water and sewage service delivery to residents. Budget guidelines for City Councils provide that only 30 percent of the budget is to be spent on salaries; the rest is to be allocated to capital development, such as improving the water delivery system.

According to media reports and sources who spoke to Human Rights Watch, water revenue in Harare now represents the largest source of revenue for the Harare City Council. However, rather than being ploughed back into the system for service upgrades and infrastructure projects, much of that money is diverted from the water account into the general City Council coffers. The money is poorly accounted for and may be unlawfully allocated towards paying the salaries and benefits of City Council members.

Residents themselves expressed confusion and distress over the water billing system in Harare. Many had huge debts, sometimes as high as $3,000, which they were unable to pay, resulting in disconnections from the public water supply. Even some people whose water had been disconnected said they were still being charged for water they did not use. Since there is a reconnection fee, most people with municipal debts and disconnected water rely on water from their neighbors’ unprotected wells or from boreholes.

One week before the July 31, 2013 national elections, the minister of local government, who oversees the country’s local governments, including the Harare City Council, announced that all debts residents owed municipal authorities in urban areas throughout the country would be cancelled. The revenue generated from water bills provides a significant portion of the operating funds for the Harare City Council. While cancelling the debts provided relief for residents who struggled to pay bills, it has also bankrupted the City Council and Harare Water, the department of the council responsible for providing clean water to residents. Not only does cancelling the debts affect past money owed, but it may also affect the willingness of people who have been paying consistently to continue to pay future bills.

Whatever the merits of the debt cancellation, the move seemed to be a political decision by President Robert Mugabe’s Zimbabwe African National Union – Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF) to deprive the rival Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) of votes in Harare. Consequently, an already barebones water service budget has now been reduced significantly.

Both MDC and ZANU-PF officials blamed the other party for manipulating tenders in order to profit from the wholesale purchase of water treatment chemicals for the city. Water treatment chemicals are essential for the water delivery system, necessary for treating municipal water before distribution. For residents, one result of officials using the purchase of these chemicals for personal financial gain is that Harare Water often does not have adequate chemicals to treat the water and then must produce less water.

At the national level, there is little financial commitment to improving water and sanitation delivery in Harare. The national government has not articulated a comprehensive plan to address the crisis. Ministry of Water officials cite lack of resources for paying scant attention to these pressing service delivery issues. Likewise, in September, an official from the Ministry of Health noted in a meeting that it would have little to no resources to dedicate to another outbreak of a waterborne disease. As long as infrastructure and health crises are not given attention by the national government, it is unlikely that the situation will improve.

International Law

Right to Water

The human right to water is included – implicitly or explicitly – in a number of international treaties and declarations. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that everyone has the right to “a standard of living adequate for [their] health and well-being,” including food and housing. This right cannot be realized without access to a minimum amount of water. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) stipulates a number of rights whose fulfillment requires access to water. It provides that no people can be deprived of their own means of subsistence and that “every human being has the inherent right to life.” The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) also recognizes the right to water implicitly. The rights to an adequate standard of living and the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, both enshrined in the ICESCR, have been interpreted to include the right to water.

The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) mentions water explicitly by stating that rural women have a right to “adequate living conditions, particularly in relation to . . . water supply.” The Convention on the Rights of the Child states that all children have a right to the highest attainable standard of health guaranteed, including “through the provision of adequate . . . clean drinking water.” The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities recognizes “the right of persons with disabilities to social protection … including measures to ensure equal access by persons with disabilities to clean water.”

Regional agreements also increasingly recognize the importance of sanitation and the human right to water. The African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights, for example, includes the right to “a general satisfactory environment” favorable to peoples’ “development,” which is unattainable without access to water and sanitation. A number of international political declarations and resolutions also include the right to water. For example, the Abuja Declaration adopted at the first Africa-South America Summit in 2006 affirms “the right of our citizens to have access to clean and safe water and sanitation.”

In 2003, the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the international expert body that provides authoritative interpretations of the ICESCR, defined the right to water in its General Comment No. 15 as the right of everyone to “sufficient, safe, acceptable, physically accessible and affordable water for personal and domestic uses.” According to the committee, access to water must be continuous, and the amount of water available must be “adequate for human dignity, life and health,” and suffice for drinking, cooking, and personal and domestic hygiene. “The adequacy of water should not be interpreted narrowly,” but rather go beyond simple quantities and recognize water as a “social and cultural good, and not primarily as an economic good.”

General Comment No. 15 specifies core obligations of governments that are of immediate effect, including ensuring access to a “minimum essential amount of water” at a reasonable distance from homes on a non-discriminatory basis and with special protection for vulnerable and marginalized groups, “ensuring access to adequate sanitation,” creating and implementing a national water strategy, and monitoring progress on realizing the right to water.

In 2010, 121 countries, including Zimbabwe, voted in the United Nations General Assembly to establish the right to water and sanitation as a freestanding right. The recognition of this right firmly acknowledges that water and sanitation are crucial not only for health, but also for other key aspects of development, such as gender equality, education and economic growth.

Right to Sanitation

Despite the international recognition of a right to sanitation, the content and progress of this right lags behind the right to water. According to UN figures, in sub-Saharan Africa, open defecation has actually increased over the last 20 years. Globally, 15 percent of the population still practices open defecation. At time of writing, over 2.5 billion people were without access to adequate sanitation, putting them at significant risk for waterborne and other diseases.

The public health necessity of improved sanitation has been well documented. Diarrhea, as a result of poor access to water and sanitation, is the biggest cause of death for children under 5 in Africa. Globally, diarrheal diseases kill 1.4 million children every year. Poor sanitation and hygiene also has a negative impact on maternal and newborn health. Unsanitary toilets and open defecation have negative impacts on both health and cognitive development. Due to lack of sanitation, more than half of school-age children in Africa suffer from worm infections.

Various studies have documented how girls’ education is hindered by lack of sanitary and private toilets in schools; menstruating girls often do not attend school because they do not have a clean and appropriate environment to take care of their personal hygiene. Open defecation and poor sanitation make children and adults sick, which disrupts education and time at work, impacting on a community’s development.

Despite the dire impact that the lack of sanitation has on populations around the world, the 2015 UN Millennium Development Goal of cutting in half, from 1990, the number of people, without access to sanitation services, remains far-off as of 2013. According to WaterAid, an NGO working on water and sanitation issues, at the current rate of progress, the 2015 Millennium Development Goal will not be met until 2049, and in sub-Saharan Africa not until the 23rd century.

Unlike the right to water, where the content of the right is fairly clear and there are basic indicators on which a country can be evaluated, part of the challenge of the right to sanitation is that its content has still not been well defined. This contributes to piecemeal and incomplete approaches to improving sanitation in many country settings.

Domestic Law

Zimbabwe’s constitution and domestic laws protect the right to water and, through protections on the environment, the right to sanitation. For the first time in May 2013, Zimbabwe’s government ratified a new constitution that includes an explicit right to water.

Although sanitation is not specifically protected in the new constitution, sanitation issues clearly fall within “environmental rights” that have appeared in Zimbabwean law for several years. For example, the 2002 Environmental Management Act contains specific rights related to the environment, including the rights to a “clean environment that is not harmful to health; protect the environment for the benefit of present and future generations; secure ecologically sustainable management and use of natural resources while promoting justifiable economic and social development.”

The new constitution also contains a chapter on “Environmental Rights,” which reiterate the rights already outlined in the Environmental Management Act. While these rights do not directly address sanitation, a healthy environment includes an environment in which human waste is properly disposed of and people’s lives are not compromised by waterborne disease.

Moving Forward

Zimbabwe’s water and sanitation problems are severe and complex. However, despite the overwhelming nature of Zimbabwe’s crisis, there are affordable measures that the government of Zimbabwe can and needs to take in order to protect the health of its population and to fulfill its obligations to respect and protect the right to water and sanitation. The government should invest in lower-cost sanitation technologies that will allow its citizens to use safe and sanitary toilets without having to wait for a major infrastructure upgrade. In some areas, pit latrines are illegal, forcing residents to either defecate openly or use broken indoor toilets. The pressure on the dilapidated sewage infrastructure from the use of home toilets contributes to the burst pipes that result in sewage flowing openly on the streets. Regulations that prevent low cost and healthier alternatives for toilets should be repealed, and the government should invest in pit latrines and community toilets.

The Harare City Council should ensure that refuse is picked up weekly. Burdensome policies that keep people from using these services, like the mandatory use of expensive city-issued waste bins, should be lifted. The Harare City Council should put oversight mechanisms in place to ensure that its officials do not harass women who are putting out their refuse for pick up. An accessible and easy-to-use complaint mechanism would also ensure accountability and offer an avenue of recourse for women who have been harassed. While extremely low-cost, these measures would go far towards clearing the streets of refuse. Residents do not want trash heaps in their homes, their streets or in public areas, and our research suggests that if there were a reliable and affordable system for refuse removal, people would use it.

Although ultimately the piped water infrastructure will need to be upgraded, in the meantime the government should make use of lower-cost options to ensure that people have sufficient potable water. Boreholes, which are a major source of water for many people, should be tested for quality regularly and maintained consistently. There should be an easy-to-use system for reporting problems with the boreholes, so that they can be properly fixed by professionals, rather than local residents improvising a solution so that they can continue to pump water from it. These homemade fixes often do not last and can cause more permanent harm to the boreholes.

The government should also invest in water-saving initiatives like rainwater harvesting. Human Rights Watch saw several UN-sponsored rain-harvesting cisterns in one high-density area, but this has not been introduced throughout the area. Harare does have a significant rainy season, and rain collection measures would lessen the burden on other sources of water.

Providing regular information to residents on water quality of both taps and boreholes would make them aware of the health risks and benefits of available water sources. Informing people about impending water cut-offs due to problems in the system would help them prepare for times when they will have no piped water, and to maximize water collection when water is available in the pipes. Refraining from disconnecting people from municipal water would help ensure that everyone has access to a minimum amount of water, regardless of ability to pay. Providing consistent information on water quality, including when a water-cleaning agent should be used, would also build trust between residents and the City Council and health workers, which has severely eroded during water and health crises over the last few years.

These low cost initiatives will afford people their dignity, safety and greatly improve public health. However, that will take real determination by politicians to fix the problems, true financial management, and inter-ministerial coordination. Without a serious commitment from government officials at all levels to make the provision of safe water and sanitation a priority, the people of Harare will continue to suffer, with no end in sight.

Methodology

This report is based on interviews and information collected during eight weeks of field research in Harare, Zimbabwe, between September 2012 and October 2013. Harare was chosen for this study because of its continued threat of outbreak of waterborne diseases since the cholera epidemic of 2008 to 2009.

A Human Rights Watch researcher, along with a local consultant, conducted 80 interviews with residents of eight high-density suburbs of Harare: Warren Park, Mabvuku/Tafara, Mufakose, Dzivarasekwa, Budiriro, Glen View, Glen Norah and Kuwadzana. Of the 80 interviewees, 74 interviews were women, 6 were men. These eight areas were selected because of their accessibility and relatively secure environment for research. Interviewees were identified in the communities with the help of local consultants.

Interviews were conducted in Shona and English. All participants provided oral consent to participate and were assured that they could end the interview at any time or decline to answer any question without any negative consequences. No incentives were offered to persons interviewed. To protect their anonymity, pseudonyms have been assigned to each individual interviewed.

Human Rights Watch also interviewed a policy manager from the Ministry of Water, Environment and Climate; an engineer and customer relations manager from Harare Water; two councilors from Harare City Council, including the chief whip; an engineer and water expert based in Harare, two local healthcare workers; 14 domestic and international NGO workers; officials from four international agencies; and local and international journalists based in Harare. We also participated in a government forum on water and sanitation and a Ministry of Health conference on Zimbabwe’s water and sanitation policy. We participated in an open and interactive meeting between Ignatius Chombo, the minister of Local Government and Urban and Rural Development, and Harare residents. Human Rights Watch sent questions to the minister, but to date we have received no response.

I. Introduction

For almost two decades after Zimbabwe’s independence in 1980, Harare’s water and sanitation infrastructure ran relatively smoothly. In 1988, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) reported that over 84 percent of Zimbabweans had access to safe drinking water.[1] By the mid-1990s, a combination of drought, a ballooning population and increasing neglect of infrastructure began to impact urban areas, and water shortages in the high-density suburbs became more frequent. Water quality also became a problem as public sector corruption and mismanagement led to the neglect of infrastructure.

The lack of basic water and sanitation services in urban areas was exacerbated in 2005, when the ruling party Zimbabwe African National Union – Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF) launched Operation Murambatsvina (Operation Restore Order), aimed at demolishing illegal business and housing units mushrooming in urban areas. Over several months, police destroyed numerous homes and businesses, leaving at least 700,000 people homeless or with their livelihoods destroyed.[2] According to the UN special envoy to Zimbabwe, Anna Kajumulo Tibaijuka, “in addition to the already significant pre-existing humanitarian needs, additional needs have been generated on a large scale, particularly in the water, shelter, sanitation and health sectors.”[3] Those left homeless had little choice but to retreat to rural areas, or to set up squatter camps that mostly lacked access to potable water, sanitation, or refuse pick up.

In 2008, as the country’s economy declined, the appalling water and sanitation situation gave way to the most devastating outbreak of cholera on the African continent in 15 years. Between 2008 and 2009, over 4,200 people died and at least 100,000 people became sick. In the high-density suburbs of Harare, the lack of water, sanitation facilities, information about the epidemic, and healthcare services, all contributed to the ferocious nature of the epidemic. Rather than muster resources to slow the epidemic, the government denied its severity and prematurely declared an end to the outbreak, although thousands were still suffering.

After the hyperinflation that led to the economic collapse in 2008, Zimbabwe’s economy is now beginning to stabilize. The July 2013 elections were free of the extreme violence that characterized elections in 2008, indicating a more stable political environment. Despite this increased political and economic stability, the water and sanitation conditions for the millions of people who live in high-density urban areas remains almost the same as it was in 2008. Typhoid, another waterborne disease, continues to pose a serious threat to the health of Zimbabweans, underscoring the urgent need for the government of Zimbabwe to provide these most basic services to its population. As long as people in Zimbabwe have almost no access to drinking water and water needed for basic hygiene, and are forced to defecate openly in public, their human right to the highest attainable standard of health, as well as other rights, will be in jeopardy.

Government officials at all levels talk of efforts to address the water and sanitation service breakdown, often referencing the cholera crisis as a tragedy that cannot be repeated. But rhetoric needs to be matched by actions, and over the last five years there has been little concrete commitment to address these issues. Although donors agencies and governments have provided millions of dollars to support the country’s water and sanitation sector, the situation of ordinary Zimbabweans living in high-density areas of Harare – those hardest-hit by cholera -- have not changed.

II. Findings

People are suffering in this area because there is no water and it is a big problem. Hopelessness is now the order of the day.

—Penelope, mother in Budiriro, October 2012

Zimbabwe’s severe water and sanitation crisis is well known. Government officials readily acknowledge that the infrastructure for the delivery of potable water is insufficient to serve the growing population of Harare. However, beyond the need for costly improvements in infrastructure, many other improvements are needed, including low cost improvements.

For example, maintaining the usability and quality of water points, such as boreholes, would increase people’s access to water in their community. Developing alternate sources of water, such as the collection of rainwater in communal cisterns, would help to relieve pressure on the scant existing water resources. Investing in alternative non-flush toilets for communities would provide people with dignity and discourage open defecation, impacting greatly on the spread of waterborne diseases. Implementing a low-cost, fee system for piped water to address the needs of low-income families, and refraining from disconnecting household water for families unable to pay, would be a step towards ensuring access to water for the entire population.

These interventions, and many others, are low cost and implementable by the government of Zimbabwe. However, despite the continued suffering of Zimbabweans from preventable waterborne diseases, the government has failed to uphold its obligations under international law and protect the health of its people. Consequently, lives are unnecessarily lost.

Human Rights Watch’s research in Harare found that lack of access to potable water, lack of health information, and lack of sanitation were violating the rights to water, to health, and to life.

Failure to Provide Access to Potable Water

Across the eight high-density areas Human Rights Watch visited, people related similar accounts of difficulty obtaining potable water. We consistently heard stories of poor water quality, lack of available water, piped water being disconnected for non-payment, discrimination in access to water, and violence and insecurity at water points.

Quantity/Availability

Sometimes we go for two weeks without getting water in the tap, so I have to go to the borehole. I have to bring a wheelbarrow with me to carry the buckets home. Because of the long lines, it usually takes me six hours to get four buckets filled up for my family.

—Gladys, mother in Budiriro, October 2012

Everyone we interviewed in the high-density areas of Harare reported a longstanding lack of access to water. While each home we visited had the infrastructure for piped water, everyone told us that water was only available erratically. Matilda, a mother of three in Mabvuku/Tafara said:

Water from the tap is very inconsistent. We might go a week without getting any water from the tap. We stopped getting water last Wednesday and then didn’t have any for the whole week, and then had it a little bit again this Wednesday. It’s really a problem. When there is no water in the tap I go to the borehole where I wait in line for six hours. [6]

In Warren Park, one of the areas hit hardest by the cholera epidemic in 2008-2009, Juliet, a mother, said:

We used to get water from the tap, but our tap has now been disconnected from the city water supply because we couldn’t pay our debt. So then we relied on the borehole for water even though the lines were very long. But now that borehole is broken so we have no choice but to resort to getting water from unprotected wells. [7]

Because of acute lack of access to water, people described having to ration water, and forgo basic needs, like sanitation and hygiene.

Beauty, a mother in Warren Park said:

When there is not enough water our lives become very unhygienic. Dirty nappies [diapers] just get thrown in empty buckets because we can’t wash them. There are flies everywhere. [8]

Heather, a mother in Warren Park who shares one toilet with 14 people, told Human Rights Watch, “When there is no water there is a rule about the toilet. Only urine. For everything else, go to the bush.”[9]

According to WHO, every person should have access to between 50 and 100 liters of water per day to ensure sufficient quantity to meet basic needs. At a minimum each person should have access to between 20-25 liters per day, but this amount is not enough for basic hygiene and sanitation, and therefore raises serious health concerns.[10]

Most of those Human Rights Watch interviewed reported that their daily water access was much less. In Tafara, Debra, a mother of three explained:

We use tap water when it is available but that only happens twice a week at most. Otherwise I go to the borehole. The lines at the borehole can be really long, so usually I just go once and get 20 liters of water to last my family for two days. [11]

In Mufakose, James, a father with two children, said:

We usually get 20 liters of water from the borehole. I budget the water so the 20 liters can last the four of us for several days. Even people who have more family members make 20 liters last—because can you imagine waiting in that line again? When there is no water going to the borehole is really stressful, waiting in the lines for hours and all the violence. So we have to make our 20 liters last. [12]

In Dzivarasekwa, Olivia, a mother of two, said:

Every day we get 19 liters’ of water from the borehole. We can’t drink the tap water because it rarely comes out and when it does it smells like sewage. My son was recently attacked by typhoid. We were very worried and he was hospitalized for three days. [13]

Primrose, a mother of four in Budiriro, explained that she spends her whole day trying to get enough water for her family:

I go to the borehole twice a day. I have to go twice because I can’t carry enough water back in one go. So after I get home I have to go back and line up all over again. I usually leave home the first time around 7 a.m., waiting in line sometime for a few hours, and then I go back again in the afternoon and wait in line again. [14]

According to WHO, water collection time should not exceed 30 minutes.[15]

Gloria, a mother in Glen Norah, said:

Usually we use borehole water for drinking and cooking. I send my two sons to the borehole. They are 10 and 17. Because the line is so long, I often send them to go at 3 a.m. when it will be shorter. Otherwise they might have to wait six hours. [16]

In Mabvuku/Tafara, Janine told us:

We get water from the borehole every day. We have to wake up at 4 a.m. to get our water, otherwise it is too overwhelmed with people and becomes a big problem. [17]

Quality

The water we get from the tap is not good. Sometimes it smells like fish, sometimes it smells like raw sewage. But when it comes in we have no choice and we have to drink it anyway.

—Stella, a mother in Dzivarasekwa, October 2012

Water must not only be available, but to prevent illness it also has to be of good quality. Nearly all the people we spoke to expressed reservations about the quality of the tap water provided for a charge by the government water utility, Harare Water.

Some residents reported that when they drink the tap water it makes them sick.

Laiza, a mother in Dzivarasekwa whose two-year-old was sick with the flu and diarrhea when we visited, said:

We use the tap water for cooking and cleaning and bathing but we try not to drink it, because it is dirty. Sometimes if I can’t go to the borehole we drink the tap water. When I had to care for my grandmother everyone in the house had to drink the tap water because I couldn’t get to the borehole. We really don’t like drinking the tap water because it gives us diarrhea. [18]

In Mabvuku/Tafara, Wanda said:

Because the tap water is dirty when we drink it, we get stomach pains and diarrhea. When there are long lines at the borehole sometimes we just drink it anyway, even though I know it is a risk. We usually end up drinking it once or twice a week because we have no choice, but we always end up getting diarrhea. [19]

Some people told us that at times instead of water there is raw sewage coming out of the water taps.

A mother in Warren Park, Naome, said:

Our tap water is really dirty. It smells like sewage and often has visible particles floating in it. My 4-year-old son has constant diarrhea, diarrhea almost every day. I don’t know what to do. [20]

Stella, a mother with three young children, told us:

Usually we try not to drink the tap water. Like last week, it was mixed with raw sewage. When we opened the tap and it smelled like sewage and then sewage came out of our water tap. The raw sewage came out of our water tap for seven days. Even when there is not actual sewage coming out of the tap, we know the water quality is not good. But at times we have no choice and we have to drink it anyway. [21]

A water expert in Harare explained that because there are leakages in both the water and sewage pipes, if there is not constant pressure going through the system, sewage can be absorbed into the piped water system and that is why people smell or see sewage coming through their taps. He said, “It’s not right, the water is not safe to drink and people should really be told.”[22]

In Tafara, Isabel, a mother of two, said:

We don’t drink the tap water because it’s often a reddish color, like rust. A health worker said we should boil the water, but we don’t know why. We don’t usually have electricity anyway because of load shedding [a shut-off to avoid electrical overloads]. If there is no water anywhere else sometimes we just drink the tap water anyway. [23]

Among residents we spoke to there was a clear sense that water obtained from a borehole was preferable to tap water. Many people said that this was because the boreholes had been drilled by donor agencies, like UNICEF, and so they assumed that the water quality was good. People we interviewed told us that getting drinking water from the borehole was a big priority.

One mother in Glen View, Catherine, told us:

We get our drinking water from the borehole and we just drink it without cleaning it. The borehole water is safer than the tap water. We only use tap water for bathing and cleaning. We don’t drink the tap water because it’s dirty, even if we put disinfectant pills in it. [24]

Even when going to the borehole resulted in very long waits in line, many people said they preferred the wait because they believed borehole water was safer to drink. In one area of Kuwadzana, where people reported that new pipes had recently been put in and that the tap water flowed more regularly, a man named Joseph told us: “Even with the new pipes, the line at the borehole is still really long, usually two hours. No one trusts the tap water, and everyone wants to drink the borehole water.”[25]

In Glen View, Memory, a mother said:

We use tap water for every purpose but drinking, and for drinking water I go to the borehole. The nearby borehole is broken, and it has been broken for about six or seven months, so I have to go much further to the borehole, and wait in a long line, usually at least an hour. [26]

Although borehole water is widely seen as safer than tap water to drink, a recent survey of boreholes in Harare shows that among boreholes that have been tested, at least one-third are contaminated.[27]

Many people we spoke with told us that because of the lack of other options, they rely on shallow wells they dig themselves to access water. Although well water can be safe to drink, the wells must be deep enough to avoid groundwater contamination and at distance from latrines or areas where people defecate. Because of sewage leakages in the piped water system, it is well known that the groundwater in most areas is contaminated. In addition, all the self-dug wells we saw, which were in every area we visited, were unprotected. Usually these wells had a dirty bucket and rope that were kept outside the well and dipped back in when retrieving water, providing another opportunity for contamination.

Even though many residents expressed an intuitive fear that this water was not safe for drinking, many said they had no other option.

A woman, Yvonne, in Mabvuku/Tafara said:

We usually fetch our water from our neighbor’s well. We use the water for drinking and cooking. Sometimes we put in Waterguard [a disinfection product] and sometimes we just drink it the way it is. At the clinic they told us that well water isn’t clean and that we should use Waterguard, but we don’t usually have any. [29]

Promise, a mother in Budiriro said:

Sometimes I get water from the well. When the tap water does not come out regularly, and when there is a bad water shortage the lines at the borehole are very long and there can be fights. That’s why we use well water for drinking and cooking and for all household chores. [30]

Shallow wells are extremely prevalent in Harare, and we saw them in every area we visited. Often while speaking with residents, they would show us the well they used for water. In many cases the wells were covered by rusty metal pieces that did not lie flat over the well. In some cases the cover lay next to the well, leaving the opening completely uncovered. People used dirty buckets attached to ropes to retrieve water from the well. Generally the rope and bucket were placed on the ground next to the well when they were not being used.

In Glen Norah, a woman named Elizabeth said:

I worry about the water in the wells, but sometimes we just have no choice. There is no lid on the well, sometimes water spills back on the ground and then flows back into the well. I know that is not safe. [31]

Even when people in the home are sick and there is a suspicion that well water is contributing, people expressed a sense of helplessness at their complete lack of safe options for potable water. In Mufakose, Jane, a mother of three told us:

The tap water is not usually available but the well water always is so that’s what we drink. I and all of my kids had cholera last year. Right now everyone in this house has diarrhea. But what else can we do? [32]

Water Disconnections

We really struggle and sacrifice to pay our water bill, but we have no choice. If we don’t pay it, the city will disconnect our water.

—Esther, mother in Glen Norah, October 2012

According to the UN Committee on Economic, Cultural and Social Rights, governments have an obligation to provide access, at the very least, to a minimum amount of water.[33] This means that officials cannot disconnect a water system for failure to pay, if doing so jeopardizes access to this minimum essential amount of water. International standards are clear that “under no circumstances shall an individual be deprived of the minimum essential level of water.”[34] The committee has emphasized that the government must ensure water services are affordable and that the lack of access to water does not threaten the realization of other basic rights.[35]

Due to the severe water scarcity in Harare, in all of our interviews people described a patchwork approach to accessing any source of water available. This fragile balance was often threatened by interruptions in tap water, or the disconnection of municipal water in households too poor to pay.

In each area we visited in Harare, people told us their water had either been shut off, or they had received threats that it would be shut off because of unpaid water bills. People routinely showed us bills that were over US$1,000. People said that their failure to pay could result in the disconnection of water services, further limiting access to water.

Gloria, a mother two children, said:

My water bill is between $30 to $50 a month, but now I somehow have a balance of over $1,000! I told City Council I shouldn’t have to pay my water bill when water is hardly available from the tap. But they sent me a Final Demand letter and a bill for $1,196 and they say if we don’t pay it they will disconnect our water. We do not have the money to pay this, our income is less than $200 a month. Where are we going to get the $1,000 to pay City Council? Our boy wants to go to school and we have to eat. We don’t know what to do. [36]

Pretti, a mother with three children in Dzivarasekwa, said:

Our water bill is between $20 to $25 a month, but sometimes we can’t afford it. Last year our water was disconnected because we had a balance of $600. But how could it be that high? They sent us a warning, but didn’t tell us when they would disconnect it, and one day just came and did it. We had to pay $100 for it to be reconnected. [37]

Another mother in Dzivarasekwa told us her experience:

We normally pay $150 a month for sewage, refuse and water. A few months ago we owed an additional $200 and now our balance is $500! I don’t know how it could be so high! I pay what I am supposed to pay but it keeps going up. They disconnected our water last year because we owed $300. They just came to disconnect it without warning us. I had to find $150 to get it reconnected. [38]

Laiza, in Dzivarasekwa, said:

We usually can only pay half of our water bill because we can’t afford to pay all of it. Last year the water was disconnected and there was a bill of $800! The City Council came and said if we didn’t pay the rest of the bill they would disconnect the water. We didn’t get any information on when this would happen. Then one day they just disconnected us. We went for two months without any water. Then a white man from the Anglican Church came and paid the whole bill. I am really worried now that they will come and disconnect the water again. We are trying to save money to pay half the bill. It’s really scary for us because we have hardly any income. [39]

Alice, a grandmother who takes care of her three grandchildren, told us:

Our water tap has been broken for two years, which means for two years we haven’t gotten any water from the tap. In those two years I haven’t paid the water bill, but I’m not ignoring it, I just don’t have enough money. I think the bill is over $2,000. In March I got a written warning that they will sell our house to pay for the unpaid bills. I worry a lot about this. I fear that any day they can come to take the house. [40]

In some cases, people said that they sacrificed other basic needs, like sending their children to school or eating properly, in order to pay the water bill. An older woman, Judith, who lives alone in Warren Park told us:

I pay about $45 a month for water. I make sure that I pay the bill every month. I will forgo food so that I can pay this bill. Sometimes I go without food, I won’t have groceries in the house, so that I can pay the water bill. I know I don’t owe the City Council money since I’m barely even getting the water service, but I’ve seen other houses getting disconnected so I make sure to pay it anyway. [41]

Merit, another woman with a high water balance, said:

I am afraid my water will be disconnected, so I want to see if I can pay an additional $20 a month on top of my regular bill. I don’t have much money so I will only eat two meals every day to pay that extra $20. But I don’t want them to disconnect me. [42]

Several families mentioned that they struggle to afford both school fees for their children and water for drinking, bathing, cleaning and cooking. Precious, a father in Glen Norah, said:

My son is not going to school because we can’t afford the school fees. The fees are $95 per term, and the water bill is $30 a month. We are really afraid our water will be disconnected. It was almost disconnected a few months ago because we had a balance of $850 but we bribed the Harare Water guy $30 and he didn’t turn off the water. We’ve gotten another Final Demand letter, this one says we owe $1,195. We have no money and no jobs, I don’t know how we will pay this. [43]

Access for Vulnerable and Marginalized Populations

“Even though I am seven months pregnant I still have to go to the borehole. Usually I go twice a day, in total six hours at the borehole. I have no choice, there is nothing I can do. Even when I have a little infant I will spend all my time at the borehole.”

—Sara, Budiriro, October 2012

Access to water and sanitation can be particularly challenging for people who are already vulnerable or marginalized, including children, people with disabilities, and people with HIV. Often people in these groups must rely on others for help with basic needs, such as collecting water, going to the toilet, and bathing, because accessible services are not available. Since it has been well documented that vulnerable groups disproportionately shoulder the burden of inadequate water and sanitation, international law seeks to protect these groups by putting special obligations on states to ensure that these basic services are offered without discrimination, and can be accessed by all people.[44]

Helen, the mother of a teenage daughter in Glen View who has intellectual and physical disabilities and uses a wheelchair, told us about the hardships she faced in accessing water for her daughter:

I am alone with my daughter. It is really a struggle. I can’t afford for her to go to a school for the disabled because it is too expensive, so I take care of her all by myself. She uses nappies [diapers] and can’t control herself so we have extra need for water in our house. I am often forced to lock her in the house alone while I go out to fetch water. Usually it takes me several hours. I feel really bad about this. [45]

Alice, a grandmother in Dzivarasekwa whose water has been disconnected for several years, takes care of her grandchildren and 22-year-old son. She told us:

My son has heart problems and he recently broke his leg, so he can’t go to the borehole. Right now my granddaughter goes, usually five times every day. She’s not going to school now because we can’t afford it. I want her to go back to school, but I’m worried that if she does, we will struggle to get our water. She is the only one who can help. [46]

Edna, a woman in Dzivarasekwa with a newborn baby said:

When there is no water in the tap it can take three hours to go to the borehole. Since there is no one here to fetch water, I have to do it, even when I am pregnant, or have this newborn baby.

Lack of access to clean water also has a severe impact on people with compromised immune systems, particularly people living with HIV.[48] In addition to needing clean water to take medications, people with compromised immune systems are especially vulnerable to infections, and therefore regular access to water for bathing and hygiene purposes is especially important.[49]

Stella, a woman in Mufakose living with HIV, as is her husband and her 4-year-old son, said:

Our water situation is very hard. Our [unprotected] well has dried up. Sometimes we go to our neighbor’s house to use their well, but at times the gate is locked so we can’t rely on it. I know we shouldn’t take our medications with tap water, but if that’s all we have there is no choice. I have had diarrhea for more than three days now. [50]

Susan, a 17-year-old girl in Kuwadzana living with HIV, stopped going to school in 2011 because her family could no longer afford the school fees. She told us how a new water pump that had been installed made it easier for her to take care of herself. She said:

Now that there is a water pump the lines at the borehole are much shorter. Before the pump we would have to wait in line for several hours. If the lines were too long I would take my drugs with tap water, even though it looks and smells dirty. [51]

Abigail, a mother in Dzivarasekwa, who told us that she and her daughters are living with HIV, said:

When no water is available in the tap our situation is very difficult. When typhoid came this year it wreaked havoc on our house and killed one of my children. In 2008 we all got cholera, even me when I was pregnant. We are being told by City Council that the tap water has improved and that now we can drink it, but we see for ourselves that it is dirty and smells like sewage. [52]

Elderly people also had extra trouble accessing water.

In Glen Norah an older woman, Elizabeth, said:

It’s very difficult for me to wait in line at the borehole. I’m too old! Sometimes I get water from the unprotected well at the church. Even though I know that water is dirty, sometimes I have no choice. When the gate to the church is closed, I try to get water from the other tenants in the house. [53]

Rosie, a woman in Dzivarasekwa told us:

Fetching water is very difficult for older people. Some residents take pity on them and help them, and sometimes people will give them preference in the line at the borehole. But often they must just endure the line, which can often be hours of waiting. [54]

Impact on Education

Beyond their susceptibility to water-borne illnesses, children, and especially girls, were disproportionately affected by the lack of access to water. Girls are often responsible for collecting water, either at the borehole or at unprotected wells.[55] Inadequate water and sanitation services in school have a particularly negative impact on girls. A study conducted in Chitungwiza, a commuter town of Harare with water problems, found that girls who are menstruating face numerous challenges in attending school, including lack of appropriate disposal for sanitary pads, severe overcrowding with insufficient toilets, inadequate water supply and little provision for hand washing.[56]

Some schools in the Harare suburbs are not able to provide students with safe drinking water. In Mabvuku/Tafara, Betty, a grandmother, explained that even though they do not drink tap water in their home because of fear of contamination, at school her grandchildren had no choice, adding:

In one of the schools here they only have tap water. When there is no tap water available, they just send the children back home. Only one school in this area has a borehole. [57]

In Mabvuku/Tafara a mother, Grace, said:

There is no borehole at the school, so the children have to drink the tap water. If there is no water at home that also means there is no water at school. When there is no tap water children are asked to bring two liters of water to school with them. I don’t know if that is enough. [58]

Violence

I have witnessed several times people beating each other at the borehole. It is really sad.

—Janine, Mabvuku/Tafara, October 2012

Many people told us that violence at the borehole was a significant hindrance to collecting water. In general people said that the situation at boreholes became more desperate when tap water was unavailable for a period of time.

Priscilla, a woman in Dzivarasekwa said:

This week there was no tap water and there was chaos at the borehole. People were fighting. It scared us. Sometimes we just have to wait until the violence is over to fetch water. Last week there was a water crisis. We woke up and discovered that there was still no water. By then there were really long lines of people at the borehole. I didn’t want to go there because I wanted to avoid the violence.[59]

Another woman in Dzivarasekwa said:

Four days ago there was a fight at the borehole where people drew machetes. I witnessed the fight myself. People were cutting each other in line, and maybe they had grudges against each other and it was just a good opportunity to fight. Some people started beating each other. Then, one man went to his car and came back with a steel rod to hit people. We just left and escaped to our homes. After that we’ve been drinking tap water. As long as there is no tap water, the borehole fights are very frequent. People will say they’ve held their place and the wait for water is already two or three hours. If you tell them they are cutting in line, they will threaten you. There are always fights. Most of them are violent fights, people use weapons. [60]

Joyce, a mother in Glen View, said:

People fight at the borehole a lot, and it’s particularly bad when there is very little water coming out of the taps. Mostly the people fighting are men who want to have control of the borehole. [61]

Because the task of getting water from the borehole overwhelmingly falls on women and children, they face the brunt of the violence, which people reported was mostly instigated by men.[62]

Another woman in Dzivarasekwa said:

Usually there is violence at the borehole, especially when there is no tap water and people are frustrated. There are men who yell that it is their borehole. On the weekends there are fistfights at the borehole, when more men are around. Sometimes it’s better to just drink the tap water than to go to the borehole at all. [63]

April, a mother in Mabvuku/Tafara a told us, “There are times at the borehole when people stone each other with bricks. The lines are just too long and often it is children who are responsible for collecting water.”[64]

Access to Health Information

Nearly all of the people we spoke with said that they did not know if their water was safe to drink.

Joanne, a mother in Dzivarasekwa said:

City Council has said the water is safe to drink, but two days down the line the water was dirty and smelly. Council officials here do not want to address these issues. [65]

Janine in Mabvuku/Tafara said:

The City Council has not told us anything about the water issues we are facing. It’s a big challenge for us because we don’t know the quality of the water. [66]

In Glen View, Irene told Human Rights Watch:

I’m worried because I don’t think the water is safe to drink. But even though it looks dirty, the City Council has not issued a statement on the quality of water in this area. I don’t know what to think. [67]

One mother in Dzivarasekwa said her daughter had cholera several years ago. Expressing frustration at not knowing how to keep her children healthy, she said:

Nobody has told us if the borehole water is clean or not, but it looks cleaner than the tap water. Some health workers came a few months ago and gave us tablets and told us to disinfect the tap water, but what about now? The tap water still sometimes smells like sewage. It is very worrisome. [68]

A woman in Warren Park, Melinda, said:

The health workers told us that we should disinfect both the borehole water and the tap water and they brought some tablets for us, but that was a while ago and they haven’t been back. [69]

Access to Sanitation

Many of the people interviewed by Human Rights Watch said that they lacked access to basic sanitation.

Lack of Appropriate Toilets

Most people we spoke to had indoor flush toilets. However, because almost no water comes through the pipes and those systems are now non-functional, people said that they have to rely on alterative water sources to flush their toilets. When water access is very limited, many of the residents told Human Rights Watch that they defecate outdoors.

One woman in Glen Norah said:

We have to use buckets to flush our toilet. We get our water from the tap or the borehole. When there isn’t enough water in the house we can’t flush so we have to just leave it there. In that case there are lots of flies around the toilet, but we try to just shut the door until we can get water to flush. [70]

In Mabvuku/Tafara, Beatrice, who was holding her sick baby said:

About once a month sewage flows outside our house. This is because the water from flushing toilets does not have a proper disposal system. It makes us worried about the quality of the well water we drink because we are afraid it is contaminated with sewage, but we have no choice. We are almost used to this situation now, but it’s not good and little kids like mine play in the sewage water. [71]

In Warren Park, a mother named Trudy said:

We have one toilet for the whole house and there are 21 people who live here. Because there are so many people the hygiene in the toilet is not good. The flushing system doesn’t work because there is no water, so we have to use buckets. When there isn’t any water for flushing people just leave what they do in the toilet. We sometimes just use the bush. [72]

Sewage

Although people described flushing their toilets once they had water, because of the inadequate sewage system, they said that sewage pipes were often bursting, that sewage at times comes up from the toilet, and that raw sewage flowing on the street was not uncommon, especially during the rainy season.

Samuel, a father in Glen Norah, showed us where sewage had been in his house and said:

Our toilet clogs at least once a month. When this happens sewage comes pouring out from the toilet. Raw sewage. All these houses near us are regularly affected by flowing raw sewage. We don’t have any disinfectant to clean it so we are just using soap. We don’t know if it works. Someone in this house is always sick with diarrhea or a fever. [73]

In Dzivarasekwa, Carol told us:

There was a bust sewage pipe two minutes from our house a few weeks ago. The sewage visibly flowed in front of our home and it smell wretched. It took the City Council over two weeks to get the burst pipe fixed. Some of the neighborhood children played in the sewage because they didn’t know it was dangerous. My children did too. I saw a child go into the sewage to get a ball that had fallen in it. [74]

In Mufakose Jane, a mother said:

We’re used to flowing sewage, it happens so often. I often see kids playing in the sewage, which is why I carry my children on my back. It becomes really smelly and there are flies everywhere and you feel like you want to run away from your own home. Raw sewage is not meant to be seen. [75]

Linda in Dzivarasekwa said:

Raw sewage is always a problem. Last week a manhole right next to our house was overflowing and stayed that way for almost a week. When it overflows you see the sewage and it smells terrible. There are flies everywhere. It lasted like this for a week. People selling vegetables were affected too, because the sewage was flowing right next to them. But they didn’t move their vegetable stands. Manholes frequently overflow. City Council doesn’t come right away to fix these problems, it can take three weeks or a month sometimes and the sewage is just flowing. When there is sewage small children play in it because they don’t know any better. [76]

In Mabvuku/Tafara, a father showed us where there had recently been a burst sewer pipe, and pointed to where the sewage had been flowing in the street. A large mulberry tree hovered over the spot, and his son was playing in the area, and eating the mulberries off the ground. On the other side of the street, in a small field where the man said his family often defecates, he showed us the shallow well he uses for water.

Naome, a mother in Warren Park described what happened when the manhole in her yard overflowed. She said:

One morning we woke up and found raw sewage overflowing out of this manhole. This very manhole that I am sitting next to! Raw sewage was flowing in our yard and it did that for three days. I called City Council but it was a Friday and they said their office was closing for the weekend and they would come on Monday. They did fix it, but we worry it will happen again, so we keep a rock on the manhole cover to keep the sewage inside. [77]

In Mufakose, Natalie explained:

Our toilet clogs up frequently and then this pipe in our yard overflows. It used to happen every day. It’s a little better now, but just last week it happened again. We have to hop and skip over sewage to get to our house. The City Council seems to be trying to fix the problem.

Refuse

Refuse that is not disposed of, especially refuse that contains human waste such as dirty diapers, can also be a breeding ground for various types of diseases. Across the high-density suburbs of Harare, refuse gathers in large mounds. Residents said the piles of refuse were attracting flies and mosquitos, clogging already overburdened sewer systems.

In some areas there is refuse pickup that is fairly consistent, while in others people told us there had not been pickup in several weeks or even months. However, even in places where City Council sent refuse workers, challenges prevent the system from working effectively.

In several suburbs, women said they were afraid to put their refuse bins out because they were routinely abused by the City Council workers who picked the bins up.

Stella, a woman in Dzivarasekwa recounted her experiences with the refuse workers:

I would rather dump my refuse in the bush than have to see the refuse workers. They won’t pick up the bin unless you are standing outside with it. One time I was waiting for them and they drove by and saw me, but wouldn’t stop to pick it up. Instead they started shouting at me and told me I had to keep up with the truck and dump it myself. So I was forced to run behind the truck with the bin as the men were laughing and shouting at me. It was humiliating. [79]

In Warren Park, Jewel told us:

Refuse collection is on Tuesdays, but it’s not consistent. Sometimes it is just one or two times in a month. We don’t want to keep our refuse piled up in our home because we are worried about typhoid and malaria. We used to dump our refuse in the field, but now they fine us if we do that. They just expect us to keep it in our home. When they do pick it up, if it’s only women at home they, treat us really badly and yell at us. [80]

Tina in Glen View said:

There is not regular refuse pickup here, so we usually just bring it to the burning dump that is right near us. That dump really worries us because there is so much smoke from the burning refuse and flies all around. [81]

In almost every area Human Rights Watch visited there were huge piles of burning refuse. Some of these refuse heaps were in public spaces, like shopping areas. Others were in fields or in the middle of residential areas. In one area, people were very upset because the refuse heap in the middle of their community was gigantic, spanning a large portion of their community space. On this refuse heap, in addition to household refuse, including diapers and toilet paper, there was a dead dog. Residents expressed concern that the combination of dead animals and human feces would only enhance the risk of disease.

In Glen Norah, Marjorie said:

Usually refuse pickup here is on Mondays. The problem for us, and other houses, is that there is only one bin for every house and they won’t pick up more than that. There are 10 people living here so we need more than one bin. We have to take the rest of our refuse and dump it in an open space. These dump sites make us afraid, because during the rainy season there are mosquitos everywhere. We know the refuse also blocks the sewage from flowing, but we don’t know what to do, since they won’t pick it all up.

III. Donor Response

At the outset of the cholera epidemic in 2008, many international donor and aid agencies mobilized to provide basic necessities for treating patients and stemming the epidemic. Since by this time much of the infrastructure of Zimbabwe had collapsed, including the healthcare delivery system, donors stepped in to provide critical services. These included supplying medications to clinics, providing households with buckets and soap, and drilling boreholes in high-density suburbs where water was especially scarce. In total, donor agencies drilled over 200 boreholes, providing people with potable water access at that time.

However, since the epidemic, some of these interventions have stalled or ended, and once-protected water sources have become contaminated. Officials from donor agencies and international organizations in meetings and discussions with Human Rights Watch have repeatedly cited endemic corruption as key to the inability of donor interventions to improve the availability of water and sanitation services. At the same time, lack of coordination between donor agencies and the government has also contributed to the limited effectiveness of these interventions.

For example, many residents informed Human Rights Watch that donor agencies had drilled boreholes to help relieve water scarcity during the 2008/2009 cholera epidemic and that these boreholes provided communities with an important source of water. According to residents, many boreholes were not maintained, and now a significant number of them are either broken or contaminated. Even government studies show that at least 33 percent of tested boreholes in Harare are contaminated. However, because many boreholes were originally provided by donors, residents tend to perceive them as safer water sources. The breakdown and contamination of these as a reliable source of potable water has complicated and worsened an already dire water shortage. Donors we spoke to said that they had handed over management and maintenance of boreholes to the local government once the cholera crisis had subsided. However, given the limited capacity of the local government to provide basic water and sanitation services for residents, a successful government handover was unlikely.

During a meeting on the development of a national strategy for water and sanitation, several participants said that donor agencies were playing the role that government should be playing, and that it was key for the government to take ownership over improvement in Zimbabwe’s water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) sector.

By implementing piecemeal interventions, from rehabilitation of waterworks in small urban areas, to education on rural WASH, to providing buckets and soap, donor agencies are contributing where they perceive they can have impact, rather than addressing the structural issues. Unless donor agencies are willing to take on the issues of corruption and lack of political will, it seems unlikely that any of these interventions will have a lasting and sustainable impact. This includes ensuring that funds are used for their intended purposes and that government officials are held accountable for the success of interventions and projects that are donor-funded. One project manager at an international NGO said of donors: “If they pushed more [the government], we could see more accountability.” Donor agency staff acknowledged the overwhelming roadblock to success in their programs created by public sector corruption. However, in the multiple meetings we attended and in the donor reports on water and sanitation in Zimbabwe, the government was never directly called out for its role in the current crisis.

IV. Political Will, Mismanagement and Government Corruption

Although old infrastructure and a mushrooming population are major factors in the breakdown of the water and sanitation system in Harare, in almost every interview we had, donor agencies, journalists, NGO workers and even government officials raised three other fundamental issues causing the service delivery crisis: a lack of political will, mismanagement and pervasive corruption. These issues have repeatedly been cited by stakeholders across the spectrum, from ordinary residents to City Council members, to officials at donor agencies and international NGOs, and by the local and international press.

Corruption is endemic in Zimbabwe. Transparency International data shows that corruption in Zimbabwe appears to be getting worse. A 2012 study showed Zimbabwe to be the 13th most corrupt country in the world, after ranking 24th in 2008. In October 2013, Zimbabwe’s Revenue Authority (ZIMRA) estimated that in the previous year $2 billion was lost to corruption. According to the press accounts, following this announcement the head of ZIMRA said that corruption in Zimbabwe has reached unprecedented levels.

Public sector corruption permeates the government. News reports indicate that local-level officials often engage in corrupt behavior that directly impacts local residents.A study done on local officials in Zimbabwe found:

Local governance in Zimbabwe is characterized by high levels of patronage and clientelism, local officials report that they receive various types of individual requests-for jobs, favors and money—and are expected to help resolve them. Answering these personal petitions is the currency of local politics; in an environment of scarcity, it fills the void.

In Harare, it is officials of the Harare City Council who are responsible for service delivery, including water and sanitation services, for residents. The City Council is made up of 46 elected councilors, a mayor and other administrative positions. The town clerk manages the City Council. Above the town clerk sits the Harare mayor, who reports to the Minister of Local Government, Chombo. Complicating an already complex urban government structure is that the vast majority of elected councilors, 39 since the July 31 election, are members of the opposition MDC. The minister of local government is a ZANU-PF member. In every interview we had with people about the government and service delivery, political infighting between the two parties and corruption, were said to be adversely affecting service delivery.

Harare Water, which is under the direction of the City Council, houses the technical and operational team for water and sanitation services. The agency is responsible for treating the water with chemicals, transporting, distributing, metering, and billing it. Despite the low rate of payment for water by residents, according to Harare Water, monthly water revenue brings $4.5 million into Harare City Council. The water account is one of the largest sources of revenue for City Council. The Urban Councils Act provides that 70 percent of the revenue that makes up the City Council will be ploughed back into maintenance and capital development, like purchase of water treatment chemicals and capital investment in the service delivery system. However, according to government officials and people who have investigated the issue, the water revenue is used to pay the salaries and benefits of the leaders of council in apparent violation of the Urban Council Act.

A study on the operations of the local urban councils, based on interviews with more than 250 local officials, found:

As for spending, the officials reported that wages consume a large share of budgets, and general operating expenses are significant. Responses from town clerks/CEOs and other administrative staff indicated that salary payments consume 20-60 percent of their respective budgets. Elected officials complained of large staff expense as well.

As a Harare City Councilor explained:

We can’t provide for our citizens because we have no resources and the City Council is broke because the money gets stolen. Our accountability system in council is one of the worst. Our books have no auditors. We can’t account for anything. Officials will just come and say, “We have used X amount.” So this is why we are in such a situation. Much more of the revenue goes to salaries than to services. There is no transparency at all.

Precious Shumba, a former journalist who now heads Harare Residents Trust, a prominent civil society organization in Zimbabwe, said:

There is a total lack of accountability and transparency within council on what happens to the water revenue. We’ve tried to get real numbers from the council on what the top salaries are, but they will not make that information public.

A water engineer who has been involved with trying to repair infrastructure expressed exasperation at lack of funds:

As far as I’m concerned, the situation in Harare is a mess. And until the resources stop being taken by politicians and start being put back where it belongs, none of these technical solutions we talk about will get us very far.

The issue of salary transparency of top city officials has become a hot-button topic in Harare. Money for salaries and other City Council expenses is said to come largely from the water account, but other information like the salaries for the top several classes of officials, is not provided, even for the City Councilors, in contradiction to the Urban Councils Act.

A journalist said:

The issue is transparency and corruption. For example, the top 20 salaries from City Council, including the Town Clerk and directors, are not made public. Then we hear that money from water revenue has to go to pay salaries, but we don’t even know how much it is. Why isn’t there the disclosure of these salaries?

The Chief Whip of City Council told us:

The water account is not reinvested because apparently there is no money. But how many grade four [directors] salaries do we have? How many directors? Twenty people get what 4,000 people should.

A top official with Harare Water expressed concern about the consequences of City Council taking from the water account. He said:

We do our own billing but then Treasury collects the money. They give us back 45 percent of the revenue, but that’s not much. It’s really not enough for us to do our job. We use that money to buy water treatment chemicals and pay the salaries of our employees. But we have over 2,000 employees! We always end up in debt to the chemical suppliers, because we just don’t have the money. Because of this, some of the chemicals we don’t even have a week’s cover for. It’s very stressful. Just this week we had to decrease the production of water because we didn’t have enough chemicals. We have to slow down the water supply when we don’t have enough chemicals.

Compounding the issue of scarce resources was the decision by the minister of local government to cancel residents’ municipal debts right before the elections. Cancelling the debts served to relieve many people of extraordinarily high debts that they could not afford to pay. At the same time, by cancelling the debts, the minister also wiped away the major source of revenue for City Council, making it even harder for people’s needs to be addressed. Because the minister of local government is from ZANU-PF, which traditionally has less support in urban areas, many people suspected that the cancelling of the water debts was a political move to gain support in urban areas while bankrupting City Council, which is made up mostly of MDC members. By incapacitating City Council and making counselors unable to deliver services, the MDC could lose support in its traditional urban stronghold.

The Harare Water manager said:

Our revenue used to be around $6 million a month. Recently, because the delivery has gotten worse, it’s fallen to around $4.5 million. But now with the debt cancellation we are really concerned. People who had been paying their bills regularly are angry that other people’s debts just got erased. And there is the sense that maybe the debts will be written off again in the future. For us, we’ve had no revenue for a period of time. Now we don’t know what will happen. We still have chemicals to buy and our creditors still need us to pay. Maintenance is almost at zero. I am nervous about what is going to happen.

Across the board there was intense concern and skepticism about writing off the municipal debts, with one donor agency worker referring to it as the “dark cloud.” During an “interactive” meeting by the local government with the public in September 2013, many residents and even councilors raised the issue of poor water and sanitation service delivery and City Council resources. One councilor said: “My area has no water, residents have had no water for so long, there is sewage in the streets, no services if there is a fire. There is nothing. What can I do?”

The issue of water treatment chemicals has also received wide public attention. It has been widely acknowledged that paying for these chemicals is a big challenge for City Council. Yet news reports, NGO accounts, and recent actions from the local government suggest that unreported preferential deals for top officials may be taking precedence over securing safe and ample chemicals.

The lack of transparency in the water sector was exemplified by a sewage treatment loan from the government of China. Soon after the 2013 elections, the Town Clerk of Harare and the minister of local government, both from ZANU-PF, touted a $144 million loan from the Chinese government as the solution to Harare’s water crisis. As part of the loan, China would send over 46 water engineers to upgrade the sewage treatment plants. The terms and finalization of the loan were conducted during a recess of City Council immediately following the elections, and the actual terms of the loan have not been made public.

As one journalist said:

You look at this loan: It was negotiated by two or three people who stand to benefit enormously from it. It was negotiated when council was out of session so there was no transparency, and no one knows the terms of repayment. And maybe the worst thing of all, it calls for Chinese engineers! We have lots of qualified people here in Zimbabwe, but they are using the Chinese money to pay the Chinese, pay their salaries and their lodging. We have tried to find out more information about the loan, but the Town Clerk remains silent.

Individuals involved in Harare’s water sector expressed concern about the amount of the loan relative to the work outlined. A water engineer who had examined the proposal, said: “Speaking from all my experience, it seems that the Chinese are really being paid a lot of money for the scope of work being outlined. The money just doesn’t work out.”

V. International and Domestic Obligations

The rights to water and to sanitation are provided in Zimbabwe’s new constitution, and under various international conventions to which Zimbabwe is a party.

International Legal Obligations

Right to Water

In 2003 the United Nations Committee on Economic Social, and Cultural Rights, an international expert body that provides authoritative commentary on the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, adopted General Comment No. 15 on the right to water. The general comment lays out the content of the right, including the obligations of states with respect to that right.

The general comment states that:

The water supply for each person must be sufficient and continuous for personal and domestic uses. These uses ordinarily include drinking, personal sanitation, washing of clothes, food preparation, personal and household hygiene. [111]

General Comment No. 15 provides a legal framework for the right, and roots its legitimacy in a number of other rights, including the right to health and the right to adequate housing. It elaborates on a number of elements covered by the right to water, including the availability, quality and accessibility of water, issues around non-discrimination and the practice of water disconnections due to lack of payment.

In 2010, 121 countries, including Zimbabwe, voted in the UN General Assembly to recognize a freestanding right to water. In 2012, the UN Human Rights Council, drawing from the legal framework set out in General Comment No. 15, endorsed the right to safe drinking water and sanitation as a basic right.[112]

According to the UN Committee on Economic, Cultural and Social Rights, governments have an obligation to provide access, at the very least, to a minimum amount of water.[113] This means that officials cannot disconnect a water system for failure to pay, if doing so jeopardizes access to this minimum essential amount of water. International standards are clear that “under no circumstances shall an individual be deprived of the minimum essential level of water.”[114] The committee has emphasized that the government must ensure water services are affordable and that the lack of access to water does not threaten the realization of other basic rights.[115]

Access to Water for Vulnerable Groups

Lack of access to potable water has a broad reaching impact, but it disproportionately affects people who are already vulnerable or marginalized. General Comment No. 15 puts a special obligation on states to provide access to water for vulnerable groups:

Water and water facilities and services must be accessible to all, including the most vulnerable or marginalized sections of the population, in law and in fact, without discrimination on any of the prohibited grounds. [116]

The general comment further clarifies that states should take special measures to ensure that particularly vulnerable groups, including women, children and people with disabilities have equal access to water, and do not disproportionately shoulder the burden of accessing potable water.

The Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities, which Zimbabwe ratified on September 23, 2013, recognizes that people with disabilities in particular tend to be especially impacted by the lack of access to water and explicitly requires states to provide water that is accessible for all people:

States Parties recognize the right of persons with disabilities to social protection and to the enjoyment of that right without discrimination on the basis of disability, and shall take appropriate steps to safeguard and promote the realization of this right, including measures: To ensure equal access by persons with disabilities to clean water services, and to ensure access to appropriate and affordable services, devices and other assistance for disability-related needs. [117]

The lack of access to clean water is also especially harmful to children, who are the primary victims of waterborne disease and diarrhea. General Comment No. 15 states:

Children are not prevented from enjoying their human rights due to the lack of adequate water in educational institutions or through the burden of collecting water. Provisions of adequate water to educational institutions currently without adequate drinking water should be addressed as a matter of urgency. [118]

Children’s right to water is also explicitly stated in several international instruments, including the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), which Zimbabwe ratified in 1990. The CRC provides that states shall “take appropriate measures” to provide children “adequate nutritious foods and clean drinking water.”[119]

In 2008, Zimbabwe ratified the Protocol to the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights on the Rights of Women in Africa. In article 15 on food security, states parties are obligated to take appropriate measures to “provide women with access to clean drinking water.”

Right to Sanitation

General Comment No. 15 on the Right to Water lays out the obligations of states “[t]o take measures to prevent, treat and control diseases linked to water, in particular ensuring access to adequate sanitation.”[121]

Although the international obligations that are associated with the right to sanitation are not as well defined as those associated with the right to water, there are certain fundamental conditions that states must ensure. In his 2005 report on water and sanitation, then-UN Special Rapporteur on the Right to Water and Sanitation, El Hadji Guisse said that, “Everyone has the right to have access to adequate and safe sanitation that is conducive to the protection of public health and the environment.”[122] This means “sanitation and sanitation facilities should be physically accessible, affordable, of a sufficient and culturally acceptable quality and in a location where physical security can be ensured.”[123]

In her 2009 report, Caterina de Albaquerque, the Special Rapporteur on the Right to Water and Sanitation defines sanitation as:

A system for the collection, transport, treatment and disposal or reuse of human excreta and associated hygiene. States must ensure without discrimination that everyone has physical and economic access to sanitation, in all spheres of life, which is safe, hygienic, secure, socially and culturally acceptable, provides privacy and ensures dignity. [124]

The Protocol to the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights on the Rights of Women in Africa includes an article on a “right to a healthy and sustainable environment.” It obligates states parties to take appropriate measures to, “regulate the management, processing, storage and disposal of domestic waste.”

Right to Health Information

Access to information is protected under both the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, both ratified by Zimbabwe. Under the ICCPR, everyone has the right “to seek, receive and impart information of all kinds.”[126] Access to information is also a key component of the realization of the right to health.

The CESCR has stated in its General Comment No. 14 on the Right to Health that a “core obligation” of states under the right to health is: “To provide education and access to information concerning the main health problems in the community, including methods of preventing and controlling them.”[127]

The general comment further states that: “Accessibility includes the right to seek, receive, and impart information and ideas concerning health issues.”[128]

The Convention to Eliminate All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), which Zimbabwe ratified in 1991, recognizes the importance of information, and in particular ensuring that women have access to information, to maintaining a family’s health. CEDAW obligates states to ensure: “Access to specific educational information to help to ensure the health and well-being of families, including information and advice on family planning,”[129] as well as: “access to adequate health care facilities, including information, counseling and services in family planning.”[130]

The link between access to environmental information and the protection of basic rights is gaining international recognition. Many European and Central Asian governments have ratified the Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in Decision-Making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters (the “Aarhus Convention”), which provides that every person has the right to live in a healthy environment, and that “to be able to assert this right…citizens must have access to information, be entitled to participate in decision making and have access to justice in environmental matters.”[131]

Domestic Legal Obligations

Right to Water

The right to water is enshrined in Zimbabwe’s constitution. Section 77 of the Constitution, “The Right to Food and Water,” states that, “Every person has the right to clean, safe, potable water.”[132]

Right to Sanitation

There is not one policy that regulates sanitation in Zimbabwe. However, the recognition of environmental rights, in both the Environmental Management Act and the constitution would include the right to sanitation.

The 2002 Environmental Management Act states that all citizens have a right to:

A clean environment that is not harmful to health

Protect the environment for the benefit of present and future generations and to participate in the implementation of the promulgation of reasonable legislative policy and other measures that—

(i) prevent pollution and environmental degradation; and

(ii) secure ecologically sustainable management and use of natural resources while promoting justifiable economic and social development. [133]

Zimbabwe’s constitution contains a specific chapter on “Environmental Rights.” This chapter reads in part:

Every person has the right:

to an environment that is not harmful to their health or well-being; and

to have the environment protected for the benefit of present and future generations, through reasonable legislative and other measures that: prevent pollution and ecological degradation; promote conservation; and secure ecologically sustainable development and use of natural resources while promoting economic and social development. [134]



Right to Health Information

Zimbabwe’s constitution contains specific protections for the right to information:

Every Zimbabwean citizen or permanent resident, including juristic persons and the Zimbabwean media, has the right of access to any information held by the State or by any institution or agency of government at every level, in so far as the information is required in the interests of public accountability. [135]

Zimbabwe law protects the right to health and environmental information. The Environmental Management Act (EMA), Zimbabwe’s primary policy on the environmental resources, contains commitments to protecting and providing environmental and health information. The EMA states that, “every person shall have a right to environmental information.”[136] Furthermore:

Environmental education, environmental awareness and the sharing of knowledge and experience must be promoted in order to increase the capacity of communities to address environmental issues and engender values, attitudes, skills and behavior consistent with environmental management. [137]

Non-Discrimination

Zimbabwe’s constitution sets out protections on non-discrimination that include:

A person is treated in a discriminatory manner if:

they are subjected directly or indirectly to a condition, restriction or disability to which other people are not subjected;

other people are accorded directly or indirectly a privilege or advantage which they are not accorded.

It provides that in the event of discrimination:

The State must take reasonable legislative and other measures to promote the achievement of equality and to protect or advance people or classes of people who have been disadvantaged by unfair discrimination, and:

such measures must be taken to redress circumstances of genuine need.

A study conducted by South African company Nanotech Water Solutions concluded that the health of 3 million Harare residents may be endangered by the provision of water containing toxins that can cause liver and central nervous system diseases.

The study, conducted last year, has been seen by the Guardian but has not been made public.

“The primary objective of the trial was to demonstrate the oxidative capacity of chlorine dioxide on the plant’s incoming and inherent algae … and its associated toxins, pathogenic (disease-causing) micro-organisms and other micro-contaminants,” said the report.

Oxidation is a chemical treatment process designed to remove organic and inorganic materials in water. The removal of algae and associated toxins, especially hepatotoxins (toxins that affect the liver) and neurotoxins (toxins that affect the central nervous system), is crucial to the production of safe drinking water.

The toxins, said the report, are found in the algae at Harare’s major water reservoirs, including the Chivero and Manyame lakes. The foul smell and brownish colour of water in Harare are associated with a plethora of algal species, the researchers added.

According to the US Environmental Protection Agency, harmful algae produce dangerous toxins in fresh or marine water. The agency warns people to keep away from from water that is green, scummy or smells bad.

News of the report has enraged local people, said Precious Shumba, founder and coordinator of the Harare Residents’ Trust.

“Residents have complained numerous times about the strong stench coming out of the water that the city of Harare is delivering to ratepayers,” she said.

“The water has visible impurities, which creates doubts and insecurities among consumers.”

Shumba said residents were living in fear of contracting diseases as a result of the dirty water, and no longer trusted the city’s supply.

“There is fear of falling sick with cholera, typhoid and other deadly diseases which might be caused by these dirty particles in the city water. The city has always defended the quality of their water, claiming that the particles are harmless, but no one really takes them seriously on this,” Shumba said.

Harare’s mayor, Herbert Gomba, has defended the city’s water quality, insisting it remains safe to drink.

“It’s safe, according to reports from our quality team,” he said.

“I am sure you are aware we are facing forex challenges and that the infrastructure is old and was never meant for the huge population we now serve. Again, we are owed a lot by our people, money which can be used to do more work if we are paid by all who consumed our water. We are working hard to pump more water through refurbishment of the infrastructure.”

Harare city council spends $3m (£2.3m) every month on chemicals intended to purify the water.

Poorer residents like Joyce Mutseyami, 40, who lives in the sleepy Harare suburb of Kambuzuma, are particularly affected by the crisis as they cannot afford to buy still water. Gone are the days when she felt she could drink straight from the tap.

This week, residents had no water for three days. Mutseyami was among many dashing out to their shared backyard taps, waiting in line to collect a bucketload of the muddy liquid that gives off a foul smell and a brownish froth. It was a typical scene in a city that is often without running water for long periods.

“I don’t have a choice [other] than to drink this water. I boil it before consumption because my children may contract diseases,” Mutseyami said.

“One day we will all wake up sick because you are never assured, even if you boil the water, that it is safe. We have petitioned the council before and even took samples of the water, but nothing has been done. It’s getting worse.”

With a baby strapped on her back, Talent Mupemhi, 30, waits impatiently for her turn to fetch water from a local borehole. She has no trust in the local tap water. Yet it was the use of unsafe boreholes and wells that probably led to Zimbabwe’s cholera outbreak in 2018.

Water brawls often erupt when people who dare to skip the line are caught by angry residents. Some even take advantage of the residents’ desperation to charge for borehole water.

Mupemhi has waited for two hours. She does this every day.

“I endure long queues every day to fetch water because I have no choice, tap water is unsafe. I only use it for washing,” said Muphemhi.

“I was once hospitalised after drinking tap water, it is dirty and has a foul smell. Surely people are dying slowly because they do not know what this water contains. There is sewage flowing around, slipping into drinking water. Do you think we are safe?”","The foul smell and brownish colour of water in Harare are associated with a plethora of algal species, the researchers added.

With their taps running dry, residents are instead relying on merchants, open wells, streams, and boreholes for water.

According to Harare’s city authority, just 50 percent of the 4.5 million people in the capital and its four satellite towns currently have access to municipal water. Two of the four dams that supply water to the city have run dry, leading to a reliance on heavily polluted water from the two remaining dams. Harare’s mayor Herbert Gomba told Climate Home News that the city was producing only 450 million liters of water a day, less than half of its daily demand. Community organizers believe the actual supply is closer to 100 million liters.

Zimbabwe is one of several major cities around the world facing water shortages, in large part due to climate change and an increase in extreme drought in recent years. Municipal water lines in the Indian city of Chennai, population 8 million, have recently run dry. In Zimbabwe, meteorologists say rains are not expected in Harare until October at the earliest. Earlier this month, officials told residents that the city will only be able to provide municipal water once a week.

The limited water still available for city use is highly contaminated by raw sewage, garbage, and agricultural, mining, and industrial waste, officials said, requiring expensive water treatment before it can be sent into city pipes.

In 2018, the Southern Africa Development Community issued a drought warning for Zimbabwe. Climate scientist Brad Garanganga said that Zimbabwe’s under-funded meteorological department did not recommend appropriate action ahead of time and policymakers have been even slower to respond.

Another major cause of the current crisis is the city’s aging infrastructure, Climate Home News reported. Harare’s water system was designed to serve 350,000 people — one-twelfth the capital’s current population. The last system upgrade was in 1994, and some sections of infrastructure have been in use four times as long as their expected economic life. The Zimbabwean government took out a $144 million loan from the China Export-Import Bank in 2011 to upgrade its water infrastructure, but the project has been plagued by corruption and the country’s long-running economic crisis.

By Sophie Mbugua

More than two million residents around Zimbabwe’s capital have no access to running water, as drought and breakdowns push the city system to collapse.



Just 50% of 4.5 million people in Harare and four satellite towns currently have access to the municipal water supply, the city authority told Climate Home News.

“There is a rotational water supply within the five towns,” Harare city council corporate communications manager Michael Chideme said. “Some people are getting water five days a week especially in the western suburbs, but the northern suburbs are going for weeks without a drop in their taps.”

Chideme said people were either depending on water merchants, open wells, streams or several council-drilled boreholes. “The situation is bad, period!”

Dr Jean-Marie Kileshye from WaterNet warned Harare’s water was highly polluted: “Water-borne diseases linked to these boreholes are on the rise, but people have had to take in their own hands water supply because the utility has failed to provide water.”

Hardlife Mudzingwa, of Harare’s Community Water Alliance, said 10 typhoid cases were reported during the first week of July in the southwestern suburb of Glen View.

Cities around the world are facing increased water stress. Last week, the Indian city of Chennai began using trains to ferry in emergency supplies after rains failed. In 2018, Cape Town in South Africa avoided a city-wide water network shutdown by just a few months.

Zimbabwe is getting warmer as the climate changes and heavy rains and droughts are becoming more intense. In Harare, rains are expected in October at earliest, according to James Ngoma of the Zimbabwe Meteorological Services Department.

In 2018, a drought warning was issued to Zimbabwe by the Southern Africa Development Community. But those messages were not getting through, said Brad Garanganga, a climate scientist from Zimbabwe. Under-resourced meteorological departments had not been able to help policy makers “make decisions to take action on this type of important information ahead of time rather than wait until a crisis hit”.

Harare obtains raw water from four dams: Harava, Seke, Chivero and Manyame. Harava and Seke are completely dry. This has led Harare city council to decommission the Prince Edward water treatment plant, which is fed by those dams.

This has left only one water treatment works – Morton Jaffray – supplying water to Harare and the four other satellite towns.

The dams that feed Morton Jaffray – Chivero and Manyame – are larger and closer to capacity, said Harare mayor Herbert Gomba. But they are “heavily polluted”, requiring more than 10 chemicals to purify. Upstream towns dump domestic, sewage, agricultural and mining waste into the rivers that feed the capital’s dams. The city is spending $3 million a month on water treatment chemicals, Gomba said, forcing it to restrict the amount released.

Harare’s daily demand is around 1,200 million litres (Ml). Gomba told CHN the city was producing around 450Ml a day. Last month, Harare City Council recommended the water situation be declared a national emergency.

Community organiser Mudzingwa said he believed the city supplies to be less than 100Ml/day. Companies that packaged and sold bottled water to supermarkets and hotels were still receiving municipal supplies, while residents saw their taps turned off, he claimed.

Harare’s water system was designed to service a population of 350,000 people, said Kileshye. The last upgrade was in 1994, but the country has since been in near-constant economic crisis. The city council’s website says some sections of infrastructure have been in use for more than 60 years, “way beyond their economic life of at least 15 years”.

With this in mind, in 2011, the Zimbabwean government signed a loan of $144m from the China Export-Import (Exim) Bank to upgrade its water infrastructure.

The government has accessed $72m, according to Gomba, with which the Morton Jaffray water treatment plant was rehabilitated. But five distribution centres and two sewage treatment plants were yet to rehabilitated.

Mudzingwa raised questions over how the other half of the loan was administered, saying: “A 2014 internal audit report produced by City of Harare showed that there was inflating of quotations on materials that were bought through the loan. Corruption marred the water project with commodities overpriced, hence the government was not able to access the full amount.”

Gomba rejected corruption allegations. “We never received liquid money, but equipment procured from China. It was due to the government’s inability to honour previous loans following the economic crisis that hindered access to the balance, not corruption.”

The mayor added that non-payment of residential and commercial rates was hampering his administration from effectively delivering water. Even after rehabilitation, he warned supplies from Prince Edward and Morton Jaffray works would reach only 770Ml per day, leaving a shortfall of 430Ml.

“We have to construct three new dams, to add about 840 million cubic metres. But over time Harare has to decommission the old dams and allow them time to rehabilitate naturally,” said the mayor.

Map: Two of Harare’s four reservoirs, Chivero and Manyame, seen to the west of the city, are heavily polluted.

In 2016, the Zimbabwean government signed a contract with a Chinese contractor Sinohydro to construct a dam northeast of the capital Harare. Mudzingwa said construction of Kunzvi-Musami Dam – 67 km outside Harare – was estimated to cost $850-900 million. But the project was not new.

“The discussion on the construction Kunzvi-Musami Dam as an alternative water source started as early as 1990 but is still not ready,” he said. “The central and local government have failed us on water supply.”

Mudzingwa agreed an urgent infrastructure upgrade was needed to solve the water challenges in Harare but he stressed the need for budget transparency. “We must also ensure citizens are involved actively in water governance framework and smart coordination between water sectors,” he said.

Council spokesperson Chideme said the city was running education programmes for citizens, “to minimize pollution of available water resources and while effectively using the available water sparingly so that we do not run out of water”.

“Technology by itself will not be good enough,” said WaterNet’s Kileshye. “The people across the whole spectrum from households, industries need to be made aware that they are part of the solution to sustainable water in cities.”

It is also an emotional topic.

Over the past decade, newspaper headlines have reflected a wide range of water challenges, from shortages to breakdowns in wastewater services to falling groundwater levels. Droughts affect rural and urban water supplies, food security, and energy production and industrial output and disrupt livelihoods. Recurring floods and cyclone-driven flooding damages property, infrastructure, livelihoods and lives. The country has also dealt with epidemics of cholera, typhoid, and other water-borne diseases, and surface and ground water pollution has been a concern.

Because of the intimate relationship between water and the country’s major economic sectors, sustainable water development and management is a necessary condition for economic recovery.

The World Bank Group is working with the Zimbabwe government to address climate threats and their implications for water availability by integrating sustainable water development and management into the country’s National Climate Change Response Strategy and into the proposed National Climate Policy.

Water, agriculture and energy sector impacts

A new World Bank Group paper on climate change and water resources planning, development and management in Zimbabwe, requested by the government, reviews the broad links between climate and the hydrological cycle and water management and case studies from cities, irrigation and hydropower projects and recommends a range of adaptation measures.

It projects by 2050 significant reduction is rainfall, river flows and groundwater recharge, with the highest impacts on the driest water catchments of southern Zimbabwe.

It encourages policymakers to develop an integrated climate change strategy for those sectors most affected by climate change: water and agriculture. It also recommends rehabilitating and expanding water supply and water resources infrastructure, focusing greater attention to the management and development of groundwater as well as improving water use efficiency, encouraging conservation and water recycling, and improving design standards to build resilience into infrastructure such as dams, levees and bridges, among other steps.

Promoting climate-smart rain-fed agriculture and rehabilitating and improving irrigation are urgent priorities for food security, particularly for the country’s most water-stressed areas in the south. About 80 percent of Zimbabweans depend on rain-fed agriculture, and the sector employs the majority of the population. The World Bank has agreed to support the preparation of a National Water Resources and Irrigation Master Plan integrating detailed climate change modeling and analysis into the planning process.","Water is a core development issue in Zimbabwe, a mostly semi-arid country with limited water resources.

296,https://www.aljazeera.com/ajimpact/thirst-zimbabwe-water-crisis-200212205033238.html,Beyond thirst: Inside Zimbabwe’s water crisis,"Chitungwiza, Zimbabwe – Ten people push down on a metal pump, drawing up groundwater from a crudely dug borehole in Chitungwiza, about 30km (18.6 miles) southeast of the heart of Zimbabwe‘s capital Harare.

The water pours into a plastic bucket and another empty container rotates in, fed by a queue of more than three dozen people waiting their turn to collect the life-sustaining liquid.

Among those waiting is 34-year-old mother of two Florence Kaseke. “I woke up at 4am this morning and joined the queue to get water,” she tells Al Jazeera.

“I then went home around 6am to prepare for my children so they could go to school. And I came back here at 8am to check how the queue was doing and then went home again for an hour or so,” she says.

Kaseke reckons she’ll get water by 9pm, but people have been known to spend all night waiting their turn.

Her experience is not uncommon in Zimbabwe, where the task of gathering water has completely consumed many people’s lives.

“Most of the time, we are here at the boreholes,” 75-year-old Sarah Zanga tells Al Jazeera. “I am too old for this.”

Water is essential to life, but in Zimbabwe, access to it has grown precarious. The Chitungwiza City Council has been failing to provide water consistently to the area’s crowded townships for over eight months.

“The water situation is bad,” 21-year-old Chitungwiza resident Fortune Magaya tells Al Jazeera. “Water only comes on Saturdays for a few hours. But not at all times. On some Saturdays, it doesn’t come.”

When it does flow, people stockpile as much as they can. If they run out while the taps are running dry – which is often the case – residents face a difficult choice. They must either queue at a borehole, or buy water at extortionate prices.

Magaya says he buys around 40 litres (11 gallons) of water a week for himself and his family, but only for cooking. The cost, he says, varies according to supply.

Some of the area’s more affluent residents have hired private drilling companies to sink boreholes on their properties to pump and sell water to their less-fortunate neighbours.

A recent report by Zimbabwe Peace Project recorded a truck in Chitungwize selling buckets of water for 1.50 Zimbabwean dollars each ($0.0625).

But since most of the boreholes use electric pumps, prices can double when the power is out. Blackouts can last up to 18 hours a day in some parts of Zimbabwe.

“It pains us to buy water the way we do now,” says Magaya.

Extortion and exploitation

Increasing water scarcity is compounding the myriad hardships with which Zimbabweans are wrestling – including a foundering economy, soaring inflation, growing food insecurity, and a deeply compromised public healthcare system.

Zimbabwe’s water crisis is rooted in a severe drought that began in 2018. Though some parts of the country experienced a brief respite in January with sporadic rains, more earth-parching weather is forecast for this year.

Access to clean, potable, affordable water is essential for maintaining individual and public health. When people face barriers to obtaining safe water, it can have negative economic and social effects as well.

In Zimbabwe, citizens are scrambling to get enough clean water to drink, prepare meals and attend to basic hygiene.

In 2008, Chitungwiza was the epicentre of a nationwide cholera epidemic linked to poor water sanitation. Now, residents are fearful of the life-threatening conditions the current water crisis could create.

“At each house, there is an average of four or five families living together and sharing a single toilet. Each of the families have kids of their own. Without water, there is risk of diseases such as cholera,” Kaseke says.

Disease is not the only worry. Women and children are bearing the brunt of the crisis.

“The kids are not studying at all as they are now spending most of their free time in water queues at the boreholes,” Anna Mamombe, a 45-year-old homemaker, tells Al Jazeera.

There are also concerns over how the water crisis is affecting the social fabric of the area.

“Married women are spending the night at boreholes and they have been many fights between couples with others accusing their partners of cheating on them and using the water crisis as an excuse to sleep out,” Kaseke tells Al Jazeera.

“The young girls are also spending nights here with boys their age and some older. And it’s dark out here. They end up doing crazy things, and that is also worrying for parents.”

Squandered opportunities

It’s not just Chitungwiza that is at the sharp end of the water crisis. In Harare, one million people are without running water. Two of the capital’s four reservoirs are empty. And one of the city’s main water treatment plants – Morton Jaffrey – has been idle since September, when it ran out of key chemicals.

Even before the drought struck, water shortages were common in Zimbabwe’s capital due to decrepit infrastructure and chemical shortages.

Relief beckoned five years ago, after the Export-Import Bank of China extended a $144m loan facility to the Zimbabwean government to modernise Harare’s water and sewer works.

But after $72m was spent with little to show for it, and with reports of corruption swirling, the rest of the loan was held back by the Chinese.

Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa reportedly appealed to his Chinese counterpart President Xi Jinping to unlock the rest of the funding, but Harare government spokesperson Micheal Chideme tells Al Jazeera that the rest of the loan has yet to materialise.

In September, Harare Deputy Mayor Enock Mupamawonde called on the government to declare the water shortage a national disaster, saying the local authority needs at least 40 million Zimbabwean dollars ($2m) a month for water chemicals. The municipality takes in only 15 million Zimbabwean dollars in revenue each month.

And until the crisis abates, people like septuagenarian Sarah Zanga have little choice but to queue for water at a community borehole.

“I have four buckets and I have been here for an hour,” she said. “I don’t have the strength to carry these, so my grandchildren will carry them after they pump.”","“I woke up at 4am this morning and joined the queue to get water,” she tells Al Jazeera.

297,https://reliefweb.int/report/zimbabwe/water-crisis-fact-sheet-no-2-2019,"The Water Crisis Fact Sheet No. 2, 2019 - Zimbabwe","Section 77 of Zimbabwe’s Constitution states that “every person has a right to safe, clean and potable water and the State must take reasonable legislative and other measures, within the limits of the resources available to it, to achieve the progressive realisation of this right.”1 Lack of key water treatment chemicals forced Harare’s water treatment plant Morton Jaffray to halt production on 23 September 2019, leaving over one million people without running water.2 Harare City Council (HCC) cited foreign currency shortages as the reason for the shutdown. Deputy Mayor, Enock Mupamawonde urged government to declare the water situation a national disaster, enlisting that the local authority needs at least 40 million Zimbabwe Dollars (US$2.7 million) a month for water chemicals, against a revenue of 15 million Zimbabwe dollars they collect per month.The World Health Organisation (WHO) stipulates that ideally every person should access between 50 and 100 litres of water per day to ensure the most basic needs are met and the outbreak of disease is prevented.4 With the serious shortages of this precious and life- saving liquid many citizens in Zimbabwe fall far short of this standard. Citizens need clean water for drinking, personal sanitation, washing of clothes, food preparation and personal and household hygiene.

Sustainable Development Goal 6 urges duty bearers to ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all. In the current situation this goal remains a pipe dream unless there is more commitment and political will on the part of local and central government to improve the situation.

Even at the continental level, Africa is also concerned by the water deficits most citizens face on the continent and the N’gor Declaration by Africa Water ministers is hinged on highlighting the importance of accessibility of clean and affordable water.

Some residents have resorted to drilling boreholes to access clean water, however these boreholesrequire electricity to pump water, something which is a challenge considering the constant power cuts lasting up to 18 hours daily. Generally, many local authorities throughout the country cannot pump running water to residents due to power cuts.5 Those with water tanks on their properties rely on individuals or privately-owned water companies to pump water into the tanks at considerable cost often pegged in USD.

Residents are mostly dependent on city or donor-drilled boreholes. These water sources are sometimes unclean due to poor sanitation as evidenced by the September 2018 cholera outbreak which resulted in over 30 deaths.6 These boreholes have been monopolised by some unscrupulous individuals who are extorting residents in order for them to get water. In Chitungwiza in Zengeza 4 (Zengeza West constituency) ZPP recorded a truck selling a bucket of water at $1.50 ZWL. Desperate residents are left with no option but to purchase the water.7 In Epworth Constituency, Ward 2, three youths are manning a borehole and forcing residents to purchase two buckets of water at $1.50 ZWL.8 Women and children especially young girls bear the brunt of the water crisis. This group spends most of their days looking for water and there have been unconfirmed reports of men soliciting sexual favours from women so that they easily access water at boreholes. School children spend long hours in water queues resulting in them getting to school tired as they at times queue up to the early hours of the morning.

Without water, the chances of them attending school and learning productively are compromised. The water and sanitation crisis places millions of residents at risk of contracting waterborne diseases. Residents have often resorted to drinking water from shallow, unprotected wells that are contaminated. The crisis has brought about issues of extortion, exploitation and school absenteeism. ZPP is also concerned about the conflicts that erupt at the watering holes as citizens jostle to get their buckets ahead of the many hoping to get the precious liquid ahead of everyone else.

ZPP calls upon government and local authorities to ensure the right to water is protected and upheld. Every citizen must enjoy the right to clean and safe water. Law enforcement agents should bring to book those responsible for the extortion of citizens, particularly the exploitation of women and children especially young girls. The peace and security of women and young girls who spend countless hours waiting in long queues to draw water is unfortunately not guaranteed. ZPP also calls on the Zimbabwe Human Rights Commission to seriously investigate the acute shortages of water faced by citizens in most urban centres.

Harare, Zimbabwe — The more than 2 million residents of Zimbabwe's capital and surrounding towns were without tap water on Tuesday after authorities shut down the city's main treatment plant, raising new fears about disease after a recent cholera outbreak while the economy crumbles further. Officials in Harare have struggled to raise foreign currency to import water treatment chemicals; about $2.7 million is needed per month.

Meanwhile, water levels in polluted dams are dropping because of drought.

""Everyone living in Harare is affected, they don't have water,"" City Council spokesman Michael Chideme said Tuesday, as residents turned to options such as bottled water or wells.

Chideme called it a dangerous situation because of the risk of water-borne diseases. ""Maybe the situation will be resolved by tomorrow but we are not sure,"" he said.

The capital now frequently records cases of diseases such as typhoid due to water shortages and dilapidated sewer infrastructure. Some residents are forced to get water from shallow, unsafe wells and defecate in the open.

The Associated Press earlier this month watched some residents pump water then wait a half-hour for enough water to seep into the well to pump again.

Twenty-six people died last year in a cholera outbreak, leading President Emmerson Mnangagwa to express public dismay that Zimbabweans were suffering from a ""medieval"" disease.

The country once was a bright spot in southern Africa and a regional breadbasket but the economy has collapsed in recent years, and foreign currency is hard to come by. Prices for many basic items continue to rise, and the public health care system falters as some doctors and others say they can hardly afford the commute to work.

As services largely collapse, many Harare residents in recent months have found themselves lining up at wells in the middle of the night for water or lighting their homes by candle or mobile phone.

The deepening frustrations have exploded more than once into protests that have swiftly been followed by sometimes violent government crackdowns.

Last year, the southern African nation suffered its worst cholera outbreak in a decade, which killed at least 26 people mainly in Harare, due to burst sewers and inadequate water supplies.

An El Nino-induced drought has reduced water levels in the country's dams, including Kariba, which supplies the biggest hydro electricity plant and hit the capacity of cities and towns to supply water to residents.

Harare City Council deputy mayor Enock Mupamawonde told reporters that the local authority required at least 40 million Zimbabwe dollars ($2.7 million) a month for water chemicals but it was only collecting 15 million Zimbabwe dollars in monthly revenue.

He said the shortages of foreign exchange for chemicals had forced the council to close its Morton Jaffray treatment plant outside Harare for now. He did not know when it would be re-opened.

""It (the shutdown) is due to the non availability of foreign currency...it is devastating to say the least,"" Mupamawonde told reporters, urging President Emmerson Mnangagwa's government to declare the water crisis a national disaster.

""We are unlikely to see the situation improving if no urgent action is taken.""

July Moyo, the local government minister who oversees the operations of councils, could not be reached for comment.

Zimbabwe is gripped by a severe shortage of dollars that has weakened the value of its local currency, introduced in June.

Last week, the Zimbabwe dollar tumbled by 23% on the black market but had recovered on Monday after the central bank at the weekend closed bank accounts owned by four companies it said were being investigated for money laundering.

The bank also tightened currency trading rules by bureax de change, limiting forex amounts that travelers could buy.

Mupamawonde said city residents owed 1 billion Zimbabwe dollars in unpaid bills, constraining the council's capacity to provide adequate services.

The Morton Jaffray treatment plant is producing less than half of its installed capacity of 704 mega-liters of water per day against demand of 1,200 mega-liters, leaving many residents without water.

A smaller treatment plant was closed last month after two smaller dams dried up, according to the city council.

303,https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/04/15/zimbabwe-unsafe-water-raises-covid-19-risks,Zimbabwe: Unsafe Water Raises COVID-19 Risks,"(Johannesburg) – Zimbabwe government measures to combat COVID-19 should include urgently providing continuous and affordable access to sufficient safe water to people across the country. Long before the coronavirus pandemic, much of Zimbabwe suffered a severe water and sanitation crisis. On March 30, 2020, Zimbabwe, like many countries, ordered a nationwide lockdown to slow the spread of the virus.

“Enforcing social distancing is critically important to prevent the spread of COVID-19, but people need clean water for drinking, handwashing, and hygiene,” said Dewa Mavhinga, southern Africa director at Human Rights Watch. “The Zimbabwe government needs to ensure an uninterrupted supply of safe water for everyone, or face magnified health risks as people seek alternative, unsafe water sources.”

Over two million people in the capital city, Harare, and the greater metropolitan area incorporating Chitungwiza, Epworth, Ruwa, and Norton, have no household access to safe drinking water or adequate waste and wastewater disposal services. Thousands of women and school-age children may spend eight to nine hours and all night in line at crowded boreholes or narrow water wells to get water that may not be safe.

Over the last three decades, Zimbabwe has experienced a gradual decline in access to clean and safe water. In 1988, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) reported that over 84 percent of Zimbabweans had access to safe drinking water. From 2000 to 2017, the percentage of people with access to safe water and basic water services decreased from 72 percent to 64 percent, and basic sanitation decreased from 46 percent to 36 percent.

Zimbabwe’s 2013 constitution provides in section 77(a) that “every person has the right to safe, clean, and potable water.” The WHO has stated that each person needs 20 to 50 liters of water free of contaminants a day for drinking and hygiene.

During a public health emergency, the government can restrict certain rights, such as freedom of movement, when strictly necessary, based on scientific evidence, neither arbitrary nor discriminatory in application, of limited duration, and respectful of human dignity. However, the government remains obligated to ensure that basic needs are met for people in lockdown, including access to food, water, and health services.

Zimbabwean authorities should urgently provide alternative sources of safe drinking water, such as safe boreholes and protected wells, and educate residents about simple low-cost safe water storage and delivery methods. The authorities should ensure that there are sufficient water points across the country to prevent overcrowding and enable social distancing.

“COVID-19 has made an already dire and dangerous water crisis even more urgent in Zimbabwe,” Mavhinga said. “Failure to provide sufficient safe water would severely undermine the Zimbabwe government’s efforts to fight the virus and protect people’s lives.”","(Johannesburg) – Zimbabwe government measures to combat COVID-19 should include urgently providing continuous and affordable access to sufficient safe water to people across the country.

Shortages of hydropower-produced electricity also have affected the city's ability to pump water from the dams.

Families in the southern Zimbabwean city of Bulawayo are going up to four days without running water as drought dries the dams the city depends on, city council officials said.

The city has since late November imposed 96-hour dry periods for residential water customers, though industrial and business users have continued to receive service, according to the Bulawayo City Council.

An extended drought has reduced supplies of stored water, forcing the city to decommission two of its major supply dams, said Nesisa Mpofu, a spokeswoman for the council.

Shortages of hydropower-produced electricity also have affected the city's ability to pump water from the dams, she said.

""Out of six dams, Bulawayo now remains with four water sources,"" she said.

The four-day water outages - up from three days previously - have spurred widespread local efforts to store more water and to find alternative sources.

Arnold Batirai, a councillor for Nketa, a suburb of Bulawayo, said many residents in his area had access to alternative water sources such as wells or water supply trucks provided by the council.

But he acknowledged that not all borehole wells were still functioning, while shortages of fuel had affected water truck deliveries in some areas.","Since November, the drought-stricken city of Bulawayo in Zimbabwe has imposed 96-hour long dry periods for residential water customers.

The Bulawayo Water and Sewerage Services Improvement Project (BWSSIP), a $33 million project is on course to rehabilitate and upgrade water production treatment facilities, water distribution, sewer drainage networks and wastewater treatment disposal facilities in the southwestern part of the city.

The project is expected to be completed by the third quarter of 2020.

“We are counting down months to completion. With the full suite of new services, we seek to reverse the devastating effects that poor sanitation and water supply has brought to this area. We look forward to witnessing the positive impacts that these changes will bring and building the resilience of this society,” said Mr Damoni Kitabire, Country Manager for the Bank’s Zimbabwe office.

Bulawayo, like many urban centres in Zimbabwe, has been affected by years of under-investment in its water and sewerage infrastructure maintenance. The city also suffers from water insecurity due to frequent drought. Less than 50% of the sewage generated in the city is currently collected, and the exposure to contamination is significant.

The project, administered by the government of Zimbabwe via the Bulawayo City Council, is designed to contribute to the health and social wellbeing of its population.

“Before the project, water was distributed on a ration basis, forcing marginal communities in Cowdray Park, an informal settlement in Bulawayo District to walk for over a kilometre to get water,” said Engineer Simela Dube, Director Engineering Services for the Bulawayo City Council

Installation of new domestic water meters

Since the project’s inception in 2015, four pumps have been replaced and 141 kilometres of network in Magwegwe and Criterion reservoir areas rehabilitated. Similarly, water mains have been upgraded, renewed and in some cases, replaced. Environmental improvements include rehabilitating two wastewater treatment facilities and replacing 18 kilometres of sewer lines.

Around 9,000 homes are expected to gain access to clean water.

In addition, nearly 2,000 municipal staff have been trained (30% of them women) to address the lack of skills to efficiently manage water and sewer service delivery systems, and several interns afforded an opportunity to hone new skills through engagement on various segments of the project. Training was provided on the environment, water services, gender and health.

Dry taps, burst pipes, human excrement flowing out of leaking sewer lines.

Residents of Harare’s poor suburbs of Glen View and Budiriro endure these challenges daily. Worse still, they now live in the epicentre of Zimbabwe’s deadliest cholera outbreak in a decade.

As of 19 October, the current outbreak – one of several in Zimbabwe this year – had claimed at least 54 lives nationwide, with three quarters of the nearly 10,000 infections in densely populated Glen View and Budiriro.

The cash-strapped government has taken to crowdfunding and launched an international appeal for $63 million to try to contain the outbreak. It has also suspended food vending on the street and banned public gatherings in central Harare and other suburbs affected by the disease.

According to health officials, the outbreak began in early September after two boreholes and a well used by Glen View and Budiriro residents for drinking water became contaminated by water from burst sewage pipes.

The inadequate public water supply and decaying delivery system was designed decades ago for a fraction of the 4.5 million people who now live in greater Harare. Residents often have no choice now but to turn to unsafe alternatives, including hand-dug wells and boreholes that also risk contamination.

“Drilling a borehole for the school was the only way for us,” explained an official at Glen View 5 Primary School, who didn’t want to be identified for fear of reprisals. “Municipal water is not reliable,” he said. “It is erratic, and we can go for a week without getting it.”

Since the latest cholera outbreak erupted, the government has decomissioned the school’s borehole, along with others in the city, citing contamination.

NGOs and private companies stepped in to provide tanks of water for the school, which needs to provide drinking water, toilets, and washing facilities for its 2,000 children. But those stocks were only due to last six weeks and the school has since reverted to using the condemned borehole, adding chlorine tablets to try to keep disease at bay.

Good and bad boreholes

Caltas Hlerima, 67, who lives in Glen View, has been using borehole water since the country’s deadliest cholera outbreak in 2008-2009, when some 100,000 Zimbabweans became infected and more than 4,000 people died.

“We only use municipal water for watering the garden and washing clothes. We do not risk our lives by trying to drink it,” she said. “The water has a stench, contains several impurities and even when you boil it, it produces a green froth.”

Hlerima is a leading member of the Kuwiririna Health Club, a community organisation that supplies 500 households with safe and chlorinated water from a borehole drilled with the help of Médecins Sans Frontières.

MSF, which has been assisting with cholera treatment and borehole rehabilitation projects, said wells and boreholes in Harare are only 25 to 35 metres deep on average, while a safe depth should be more than 35 metres.

Bjorn Nissen, MSF’s country director, told IRIN that boreholes drilled using new and improved techniques must be embraced as a solution until the city can provide clean and safe water in sufficient quantities to everyone.

He said there was a tendency from the city authorities to see them as “competition” that may excuse residents from wanting to pay for water services, leaving less revenue for municipalities.

kuwirirana_1_edit.jpg Tonderayi Mukeredzi/IRIN A Kuwiririna Health Club water point.

“These improved boreholes must not be looked upon as competition, but as the best tool in the interim period to keep the population safe,” he said. “They should not be stigmatised. They should be emphasised.”

A chronic problem

Cholera, which is endemic in Zimbabwe, is caught by eating food or drinking water contaminated with cholera bacteria. It is preventable by using safe drinking water and observing good hygiene and sanitation. Causing severe diarrhoea, the infectious disease can lead to dehydration and death if untreated, and death rates can soar when combined with other factors like malnutrition or HIV.

Children are particularly at risk as they are more likely to drink from unsafe sources or eat contaminated food. Girls are especially vulnerable in Zimbabwe due to a lack of proper toilet facilities that encourages unsafe practices.

Cholera outbreaks in Zimbabwe have become more frequent since the early 1990s, triggered mostly by poor water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) infrastructure and the lack of access to clean water, especially for the soaring population in the capital.

In the first quarter of the year, another cholera outbreak that affected Harare, the nearby satellite town of Chitungwiza, and Chegutu, a township to the west of the capital, claimed seven lives and left 177 people sick.

While studies are planned to try to prove the link between Zimbabwe’s cholera outbreaks and groundwater contamination in the affected areas, an 18 September briefing note from humanitarian assessment specialists ACAPS blamed broken and burst sewers and poor WASH infrastructure.

In areas like Glen View and Budiriro, waste from burst sewage pipes easily flows into shallow wells, contaminating the water table. Boreholes drilled in areas plagued by sewer leaks are often highly contaminated, particularly if the borehole is not deep enough.

Hardlife Mudzingwa, director of the Community Water Alliance, a local NGO, told IRIN that Harare residents have no choice but to develop alternative sources as the local authority is failing to provide long-term solutions.

These alternatives include unprotected wells that lie open or hold stores of unchlorinated water, and borehole water, much of which is contaminated by burst sewers and sewage treatment plants discharging effluent.

“The water authority is supplying water to the affected cholera areas from bowsers (tankers) with the help of private companies and NGOs. But that is not a lasting solution,” he said. “I don’t see the bulk water supplies being sustained beyond three months and that means people will resort back to their usual dirty sources of water.”

A new drilling technique

MSF has been rehabilitating boreholes in Zimbabwe since 2015 and reckons it may have come up with at least part of the solution.

“We have rehabilitated more than 70 boreholes in 13 suburbs in Harare. During the rehabilitation, we realised that the construction of the boreholes was not done properly,” said Danish Malik, a water and sanitation engineer working with MSF.

“When constructing a borehole there are few things one must consider, like which drilling technique to use based on the soils and hard rock that form the ground, and how deep the water-bearing rock (aquifer) is,” Malik explained.

MSF is now conducting geophysical surveys to determine the best places to drill and employing a new technique that uses a super seal to protect boreholes from infiltration in highly contaminated ground. New chlorination systems and diagnostic tool kits that include a camera lowered into the borehole can also help make the water safer, MSF said.

So far, Malik said, there has been “zero contamination” in boreholes drilled using the new and improved technique, and MSF is in discussion with the City of Harare to roll it out more widely.

But, as in the past, the response to the current cholera outbreak is reactive. WASH experts say the longer-term solutions include replacing the antiquated water and sewage systems, building new dams, urban planning, and a sustainable waste disposal system.

But all that takes a lot of money. According to Mudzingwa, most programmes in Zimbabwe are donor driven, and when funds deplete, the country plunges into water crisis yet again.

“What we need is fiscal commitment from both the local authorities and government towards WASH. We need a water budget. Presently, the [Harare] municipality budget is swallowed by salaries,” he said. “Government should show fiscal commitment to improve access to water through a meaningful budget allocation [five percent] to the local authorities.

By Bulawayo Correspondent

ANTIQUATED Bulawayo City Council KSB water pumps are now compromising the quality of the city’s water, latest council minutes have revealed.

The local authority has already approved plans to decommission the pumps at its water works after investigations linked the recent diarrhoea and typhoid outbreak in Luveve to the inefficient infrastructure.

The outbreak killed 13 people in the suburb and also affected more than 2000 other residents.

According to council’s latest Environment, Management and Engineering Services committee report, the city fathers are concerned about the KSB pumps which pump untreated and raw water at the criterion works.

“The Director of Engineering Services reported that KSB pumps stationed at Ncema and Fernhill pumping stations pumps untreated water into the raw water reservoir at Criterion water treatment works.

“In addition to the KSB pumps, there were Sulzer pumps that also conveyed untreated water into the raw water reservoir at Criterion water treatment works.

“This current situation at all raw water pumping stations posed a great risk on the water security of the city especially with the current drought condition and decommissioning of almost half the supply dams,” reads part of the report.

According to the report, currently, the Sulzer pump stations are operating without any stand-by pumps.

“These stations were also in relatively bad condition. The current unfortunate water scarcity and lack of raw water that was to be pumped by the KSBs strongly encourages and supported the decision of removing the working pumps so that the contract would be completed and commissioned before the coming rainy season in October 2020,” the report added.

The councillors resolved to fully decommission the two raw water KSB pumping stations at Ncema and Fernhill for a period between 8 to 10 weeks.","Spread This NewsBy Bulawayo CorrespondentANTIQUATED Bulawayo City Council KSB water pumps are now compromising the quality of the city’s water, latest council minutes have revealed.

The residents say memory loss, kidney failure, severe stomach pains among other major health problems have emerged.

Residents who spoke to Infocus News narrated an emergence of health complications despite receiving medical assistance to treat gastroenteritis.

A woman who spoke on condition of anonymity said most of her family members had developed health complications that are affecting their vital organs.

“Several residents have developed other sicknesses that we initially did not have. I was surprised when my two-year-old baby was recently diagnosed with Tuberculosis,” she said.

“My other children are suffering from memory loss and I am certain they are now suffering from a mental health condition. Some residents suffered from a skin problem that caused their lips to crack and skin to peel off, leaving behind botched, parched parts,” she added.

Patience Mungwiro, a lactating mother said she was not able to breastfeed her baby due to swollen breasts.

“I am still not able to breastfeed my child because my breasts are swollen. Ever since I drank this water, I have been feeling weak so much that I am failing to even take good care of my child,” said Mungwiro.

“When I told my husband, he took me to the clinic for help but not much has changed as I am still experiencing problems,” she added.

Soneni Hlabangani said residents are still demanding answers from the Bulawayo City Council (BCC) as the outbreak had severely damaged their health.

“As residents we still need answers from the Council. The issue has been neglected now but as residents we still want those answers because we have and are still suffering from the after effects of the water we consumed in May,” she said.

Residents are adamant that the outbreak was a result of the Council’s incompetence which has caused loss of lives.

Gogo Nitta Mangena, said she had lived all her life in Luveve and has never experienced such a dilemma caused.

“I have lived in Luveve all my life but I have never seen people die from drinking water. A lot of people are still sick here and most of them have developed ailments which have damaged their entire bodies,” said Mangena.

Mangena added: “Some of these residents cannot afford to buy water to drink everyday because they have to take care of their sick family members and put food on the table at the same time. I urge the Council to be transparent with residents and deal with the water situation once and for all.”

Luveve residents call upon the City Council to account for the loss of lives and give them a full report of the real cause of their sicknesses. Luveve suburb has been exempted from the 144 hour water rationing scheme to help manage the outbreak.

Blessings Chidakwa and Victor Maphosa

VENDORS, taking advantage of acute water shortages in Chitungwiza, are enjoying brisk business selling a 20-litre bucket of water at prices ranging from $2 to $10.

Selling water is now common in most parts of Chitungwiza with companies and pushcart vendors competing for customers.

The source of the water varies from boreholes, which are safe, to unprotected shallow wells and pools, where safety is questionable.

Most residents get council water once a fortnight while some parts of the town do not get water at all.

Families are drilling boreholes and digging wells at their homes not just to have their own source, but also to make money.

Most families are now relying on such supplies, although sellers cannot provide test results, since there is no choice.

The problem is that water from unprotected wells and other questionable sources is usually cheaper than water from boreholes, and the price does affect choice.

As in eastern and northern Harare, bulk water suppliers are in business with large trucks, sometimes with double trailers, coming from as far as Chinhoyi to fill tanks in Chitungwiza yards.

Chitungwiza has always bought bulk water from Harare and has no dams and or water treatment plant of its own.

The cut back in Harare water treatment has seen supplies to Chitungwiza slashed. The municipal council, like Harare, has drilled a handful of boreholes, but the number is totally inadequate.

Water is being sold by the bucket at various spots including houses, open spaces, shopping centres and industrial sites.

Mafias have also moved in, controlling queues at public boreholes and charging people a once-off “joining fee” of $20 to access the public water.

Borehole queues and water-selling points have also become high risk for Covid-19 as no physical distancing is being observed and most often people are not properly wearing masks.

Public boreholes are also running dry quickly as they are overwhelmed. In Unit A, drinking water extracted from boreholes is being sold for $10 while $5 is charged for water from unknown sources.

As of last Friday one of the cheapest selling points was in Zengeza 4 near Total service station, a house next to Stella furnitures where people draw water through a hose pipe and a bucket was selling for $4.

At a house near Limbani Shopping centre in Zengeza 5, desperate residents were buying water for $2.50 for a 20-litre bucket.

One of the residents, Fredrick Chimwe who was in the queue said he has no choice since the municipality was failing to provide them with water.

“We do not have a choice. Authorities who are supposed to provide us with water have failed us. I buy 12 buckets of water daily and I hire someone to carry those buckets to my house and they charge $2 per bucket. So all in all, I need close to $50 daily for water.”

Another house opposite Corner Shop in Zengeza 5 is enjoying brisk business as well as the owners are selling a bucket of borehole water for $2.50.

At a house near Stella Furnishers in Zengeza 4, people were buying water for $2 per bucket.

From the survey, a family in Manyame Park’s Phase One proved to be the most expensive, charging US$1 for 10 buckets or $10 for a bucket.

Those staying close to Hunyani stream in Manyame Park and St Mary’s are the most affected after the stream dried up in February this year.

Some residents who are feeling the pinch of buying water daily have resorted to drilling illegal community wells in violation of the council by-laws.

At least six families are contributing money to drill wells at open spaces in the suburb for their exclusive use.","Chitungwiza residents queue to buy water for domestic use from a house that has a borehole in Zengeza on Sunday.

“We are currently facing challenges in procurement of water chemicals. This has seen us being forced to reduce water production”, reads part of the statement from the local authority.

Water production has sunk low to below 150 megalitres per day against a demand of 1200 megalitres per day as the City is now running out of water treatment chemicals.

The situation has led to convergence of residents mainly women at public water points in most high-density suburbs such as Mabvuku, Tafara, Kuwadzana, Glenview and Budiriro as people look for the precious liquid.

The shortage of water treatment chemicals to the City come at a time when the government is supposed to comply to the High Court Order by availing funds to the local authority to improve water supply during the Covid pandemic.

The Ministry of Local Government have failed to respond to correspondence by CHRA and confirm whether it has availed funds to the City of Harare for water provision in compliance with the 31st March 2020, High Court Order.

Mashonaland East Correspondent

The African Development Bank (AfDB) has availed US$520 000 to Marondera Municipality for the upgrading of its water and sewer system.

This comes after Marondera municipality’s sewer system ceased to function more than a decade ago.

The move is going to see the local authority completing its major water and sewer project and end the water challenges in the town.

Marondera Mayor Councillor Chengetai Murowa said the projects to be undertaken with the funds had been divided into two phases, with phase one set to gobble US$477 000, while phase two would chew US$43 000.

“Phase one will focus on major upgrades of the existing water treatment plant at a cost of US$477 000, which includes installation of back-up pumps, laboratory equipment for testing water, water flow measuring metres, new chlorinator and new aluminium dosing pumps,” he said.

Cllr Murowa said under phase one, council was also going to install some leak detection devices to ensure that water was not lost through leakages.

It will also install non-return and gate valves, new lime feeders, as well as a new pump for quarry ponds commonly referred to as Hokoyo Ngozi in Marondera. Phase two of the project will see the rehabilitation of water infrastructure to the tune of US$43 000.

“This will involve upgrading of Cherutombo and Dombotombo Pump Stations, the replacement of broken sewer pipes, a development that will go a long way towards minimising the risk of Marondera water getting polluted,” he said.

Cllr Murowa said under this phase, they were going to revamp the Elmswood ponds where all sewer will be directed to, unlike the current scenario in which raw sewer was ending up in Rufaro Dam, the town’s main source of drinking water.

He said the tender process was finalised and all that was left before the implementation of the project was the publication of award notices in a newspaper, which would be done by the Ministry of Lands, Agriculture, Water and Rural Resettlement.","Andrew MuvishiMashonaland East CorrespondentThe African Development Bank (AfDB) has availed US$520 000 to Marondera Municipality for the upgrading of its water and sewer system.

This came out during a meeting that was facilitated by Women’s Institute for Leadership Development in partnership with Youth Edutainment Services (YES) Trust.

Solwezi is under the jurisdiction of Plumtree Town’s Ward 1 but is located in the peri-urban parts of the town and is currently not receiving purified water. Calling Ward Councillor BigBoy Magalane to account, women said the fixed water charges they are paying are too expensive for a community that is not being supplied with treated water.

Access to clean and potable water has become a major challenge, as water in the area is now hazardous to health. Domestic and wild animals drink from water sources intended for humans.

“Various activities take place at the dam that supplies our town with water. There are some who practise fishing and in rather disturbing news, there have been reports of individuals who lost their lives in the dam. It is under such circumstances where you learn that raw water is continuously pumped into our taps.

“Pressure valves are also resulting in increased pipe bursts in most homesteads. We hope that the Council will fix this by resuscitating the reservoir tanks that were used when Zimbabwe National Water Authority (ZINWA) was still in charge of water in the town,” said one of the women.

Residents also called for the drilling of boreholes that will benefit Solwezi area. Currently, the area has two boreholes which are not adequate for the two villages.

Responding to citizens’ concerns, Councillor Bigboy Magalane said he will forward the recommendations to the engineering department.

During the meeting, two representatives were selected to work with the Councillor in rectifying the challenge caused by inadequate access to clean water.

Citizens were also conscientized on COVID-19 and preventive measures.

Fifty people and their cattle share the only borehole in Gongu village in southwestern Zimbabwe, meaning frequent handwashing to fight the coronavirus is easier said than done.

Across drought-hit southern Africa, COVID-19 has spurred governments to dispatch water tankers, drill boreholes and repair taps — solutions experts and residents of thirsty slums and villages say must last long after the pandemic has passed.

""We're calling for the government to do more because at the moment there are few boreholes,"" Khulekani Ncube, Gongu village's headman, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone.

""Most villagers don't have soap and masks to protect themselves against the virus. But we conserve the little water we have to prevent the spread of COVID-19,"" he said.

Many central and western parts of southern Africa — including Zimbabwe — have experienced their lowest rainfall since 1981 over the past year, according to the United Nations, highlighting inadequate water access across the region.

Nearly 70% of Africans would struggle to access food and water if in lockdown for 14 days, according to a report by the Partnership for Evidence-based Response to COVID-19 (PERC), a consortium of global public health organizations.

The report published on Tuesday found that social media comments from Africans, specifically in central and southern regions, spotlighted the ""incomprehensibility"" of following handwashing instructions in areas with little water.

As authorities scramble to boost immediate water supplies, tapping state funds or in partnerships with charities, specialists say longer-term solutions might prove more cost-effective too.

""Water tankers are good for emergencies, but one of the most expensive water solutions out there,"" said Barbara van Koppen, a southern Africa researcher with the International Water Management Institute, a nonprofit research organization.

""We need to use the coronavirus crisis to question: what are short-term solutions and what are long-term?"" she said in a phone interview.

IN THE PIPELINE

South Africa has more than 7,200 confirmed coronavirus cases, the highest on the continent, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University.

The South African government sent an estimated 7,700 water tanks and 1,200 water trucks to villages and townships across the country, the official news agency reported.

""We're looking into using reservoirs, drilling boreholes and making use of groundwater too,"" said Sputnik Ratau, a spokesman for the country's water and sanitation department.

But some communities say they are tired of waiting for lasting solutions to the long-standing problem.

""Some villages have not had running water for over 20 years,"" said journalist Ndivhuwo Mukwevho from Limpopo, South Africa's northernmost province, who wrote about the delivery of 132 water tanks to drought-stricken villages in the province in early April.

""Access to water will help with hand washing, but also cooking, drinking and cleaning,"" Mukwevho said. ""We just hope the water tankers are still here after the pandemic.""

Across the border in Zimbabwe, which has at least 34 coronavirus cases, 62,000 liters (16,000 gallons) of water have been distributed during the outbreak, said Moment Malandu, coordinator for the government rural infrastructure agency in Matabeleland South province.

As they wait for more emergency water aid, people are innovating too.

Gongu villagers use five-liter buckets called ""Tippy Taps"" that slowly dispense water through an attached nozzle, aiding hand washing and making their borehole supply last longer.

More permanent measures are also in the pipeline.

Malandu said the coronavirus pandemic had spurred ongoing repairs of 1,200 water points and accelerated plans to help drill 600 new boreholes in Zimbabwe's eight provinces.

'ENOUGH TO GO AROUND'

In Malawi, which has at least 41 coronavirus cases, the government's COVID-19 response includes a $5.6 million water distribution plan, involving the construction of solar-powered water systems and the repair of existing water sources.

Mozambique, which is still recovering from two devastating 2019 cyclones, has partnered with the United Nations to establish a COVID-19 municipal task-force to assess key water points for people with disabilities and in informal settlements.

The government has also suspended collection of a water supply tax in rural areas during the current crisis, according to a United Nations report.

Mozambique has reported at least 80 cases of the virus according to Johns Hopkins University.

In West Africa, the Ebola outbreak led to an increase in demand and supply of water to prevent the spread of the disease, according to a water security report published by K4D, a platform for evidence-based research.

The researcher van Koppen said there was enough water in southern Africa, urging governments to prioritize and invest in water infrastructure to ensure demand is met during the coronavirus crisis and beyond.

""Governments need to start with what is already there. For example, often there are boreholes that already exist but don't work as they are badly maintained,"" she said, adding that asking communities what they need is an important first step.

""There is actually enough water to go around,"" van Koppen said. ""It's just about prioritization. Do we use it for luxury uses, such as golf courses, or do we invest in water infrastructure where it's most needed?""

By Bulawayo Correspondent

THE Zimbabwe National Water Authority (ZINWA) has increased tariffs for the Mtshabezi Dam raw water by close to 2 000 percent in a development likely to trigger an resultant hike in Bulawayo city council water charges.

Bulawayo City Council currently draws its water from the government owned Mtshabezi dam as well as from Insiza and Inyankuni dams.

Council has so far decommissioned three of its dams namely Lower Ncema, Umzingwane and Upper Ncema because the water sources have run off water.

According to latest council minutes, ZINWA has increased the water charges from 29 cents per kilolitre to $6, 18 per kilolitre.

“Please be advised that the raw water tariff for Mtshabezi water will be reviewed to $6, 18 per kilolitre. This has been necessitated by the general increase in prices with particular reference to electricity and spares for repairs and maintenance.

“The tariff will be reviewed after three months, if there are substantial movements of prices of critical inputs,” reads a letter from Zinwa.

According to the minutes, the local authority has also tasked its financial services department to evaluate the implications of the increase to the city’s water costing formula.

“When council supplies water to ZINWA, it would have added value to it such as treating and pumping. Thus, council’s value addition should be over and above the cost of purchasing raw water. This talks to the need for council to review all its tariffs as costs keep increasing,” further stated the council minutes.

The city has upped its weekly water shedding hours from 120 to 144 hours in a move which has seen some residents going for days without running water as the city takes drastic measures to conserve the remaining water in the city’s dams.","Spread This NewsBy Bulawayo CorrespondentTHE Zimbabwe National Water Authority (ZINWA) has increased tariffs for the Mtshabezi Dam raw water by close to 2 000 percent in a development likely to trigger an resultant hike in Bulawayo city council water charges.

319,https://www.herald.co.zw/water-shortage-and-covid19/,Water shortage and COVID19,"To mark a decade after Zimbabwe became a signatory to the Human Rights to Water and Sanitation (HRWAS), the water movement will take a stock on where we are in terms of accessibility, availability, acceptability and quality of potable water.

Hardlife Mudzingwa the Founder of the Community Water Alliance said it is important to state that besides appending her signature to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights where under General Comment 15 everyone is entitled to available, physically accessible, affordable, acceptable and quality potable water; Zimbabwe went further to be party to Convention on Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, Convention on Rights of Children and Convention on Rights of Persons with Disabilities. These commitments were a promisory note to entrench social inclusion in amongst other sectors, the water delivery framework.

He said a decade later Zimbabweans are still subjected to a serious crisis of water delivery, with dangerously low daily water production as compared to demand. In Harare Metropolitan Province daily production stands at an average of 300 megalitres per day against daily demand of 1200 megalitres per day. “Chitungwiza Municipality gets 14 megalitres per week whilst demand in 70 to 75 megalitres per day. Epworth has almost zero municipal water delivery. Masvingo Municipality produces almost half of daily demand. Gweru produces between 20 to 40 megalitres per day depending on availability of electricity whilst daily demand is 80 megalitres per day. The City of Bulawayo has since declared a crisis of water delivery which has been made worse by the dry region that the city finds itself in,” he said. While this shortage takes a national outlook, Zimbabwe has had long decades plans to boost water production, plans of which never materialized. Zambezi Water project and construction of Kunzvi dam stands as examples of long held plans that never came to fruition.

“Besides production decifit which has affected availability and physical accessibility of potable water, Zimbabwean cities have been marred by Stone age diseases like typhoid and cholera. A decade after commitment to the human rights to water and sanitation proclamation, our citizens succumb to cholera and typhoid, diseases which express poor quality of potable water. Citizen trust and acceptability of taste and odor of potable water, is not there, ” Mudzingwa added.

The burden of a national crisis on potable water is weighing heavily on women who have been confined to fee-free household chores of fetching water by our patriarchal system. He said, women groan at boreholes within towns, some raped on their way to fetch water and others suffering most horrible GBV and violence.

“With the novel Coronavirus pandemic, women are exposed more whilst they congest, queue and jostle for access at public water points (Boreholes). They are required to fulfill unpaid care work. They are required to provide much needed water for regular handwashing, ” he said.

He said Zimbabwe has not honored commitment to citizens rights to water and sanitation.

” As we reflect today, there is need to ensure that proper planning is backed by meaningful financial and human resources allocation. The paltry national budget allocation to water and sanitation which has been the case since late 80s will not help the nation. We need to properly manage our expenditure on water and sanitation,” he said.

320,https://allafrica.com/stories/202004140554.html,Mozambique: Enough Water Available for Greater Maputo,"Maputo — Mozambique's National Director of Water Supply, Nilton Trindade, on Sunday guaranteed that the Greater Maputo Metropolitan Area will have sufficient water to last until the start of the next rainy season (in October).

With the Covid-19 pandemic, a reliable supply of clean water has become more vital than ever, since one of the main preventive measures against the disease is frequent washing of hands with soap and water.

Speaking at a Maputo press conference, Trindade said there is no danger of the main source of water for Maputo, the reservoir behind the Pequenos Libombos dam, running dry any time in the near future.

The level of the reservoir is currently at 30 per cent of its capacity. Although this is low, it is enough to keep Maputo, the neighbouring city of Matola and the town of Boane supplied for several months.

Trindade said that the Public Works Ministry has decided to stop disconnecting clients from the water supply network when they fail to pay their water bills. Fines for delays in paying bills have also been suspended, and clients already disconnected will be reconnected, simply to ensure that an adequate supply of water is available for hygiene purposes.

Trindade made it clear that these are temporary measures, while the coronavirus crisis lasts, and that the water bills will eventually have to be paid.

The National Director of Public Health, Rosa Marlene, told the press conference that a further case of Covid-19 was diagnosed on Saturday, bringing the total number of known cases in Mozambique to 21.

The new case is a contact of one of the nine people previously diagnosed as positive who work for the French oil and gas company, Total, in the northern province of Cabo Delgado. The man is an Australian citizen in his 50s, who was already under home quarantine in Maputo. He has now been put into isolation in a room in a Maputo hotel.

The Australian had developed slight symptoms, notably a fever and a cough, on Saturday. A sample was collected from him and it proved positive for Covid-19.

Marlene announced that the Health Ministry's statistics on coronavirus testing now include not only the tests undertaken in the laboratory of the National Health Institute (INS), but also those done by private laboratories.

Up until Sunday, 679 suspect cases had been tested, 26 of them in the previous 24 hours. The great bulk of those tested have proved negative for the coronavirus, so that currently there are just 21 positive cases (two of whom have made a full recovery) and no deaths.

323,https://www.water-technology.net/projects/bieradondo/,"Beira Dondo Water and Sanitation Projects, Mozambique","With the inauguration of the new water treatment plant at Mutua in May 2007, an important milestone was passed in Mozambique’s ambitious drive towards improving its provision of potable water and sanitation.

Doubling the supply of water to the cities of Beira and Dondo, the plant was opened by the country’s President Armando Emílio Guebuza the day after he formally launched the next stage of the project to deal with Beira’s sewage. Construction of the Beira treatment plant was carried out during a period of 30 months and was completed in June 2012.

This latest part of the scheme comprises of rehabilitating the existing sanitation network, together with the construction of a number of new system elements to extend and upgrade the sewers, wastewater treatment facilities and a drainage system.

The new water plant cost €5.6m, while the Beira sanitation system cost €62.65m, with the EU providing €52.95m, and the remaining €9.7m provided by the Mozambique Government.

Mozambique’s historical water and sanitation problems

""Recognising the importance of water and wastewater provision to the health of the nation, in 1995 the government of Mozambique developed a National Water Policy.""

In 1975, Mozambique became an independent country after nearly 500 years as a Portuguese colony. It was also one of the poorest countries in the world, and a civil war that commenced from 1977 to 1992 did little to improve this.

In 1987, the government began a series of reforms intended to stabilise the economy, improve the country’s infrastructure and improve the population’s standard of living.

Access to drinking water and sanitation in Mozambique was historically a major problem, alike many of the sub-Saharan African nations. It has been estimated that in developing countries, around 80% of all disease arises as a direct result of inadequate sanitation, poor hygiene, and contaminated water.

According to the United Nations Environment Programme, each day around six thousand people die from diseases caused by poor sanitation, while another 300 million Africans have no access to clean water.

For Mozambique in 1992, around a fifth of the country’s households had access to potable water and the situation for wastewater provision was even worse. This was a serious public health issue in an area where cholera, dysentery and other water-borne diseases are endemic.

National water policy and European support

Recognising the importance of water and wastewater provision to the health of the nation, the Government of Mozambique developed a National Water Policy in 1995, following it three years later with the First National Water Development Programme. By 2003, the proportion of households with drinking water access had risen to a third.

To improve the provision of wastewater treatment, the National Water Directorate produced a strategy sanitation plan in 2004 for the municipalities of Beira, Dondo, Maputo, Matola, Nampula, Pemba, and Quelimane.

In December of the same year, Joaquim Chissano stepped down as president after 18 years in office. His elected successor Armando Emílio Guebuza pledged to continue the programme of economic and infrastructure development, which encouraged growing foreign investment. Despite the great advances that Mozambique has made, external assistance remains essential.

The EC is currently financing water and sanitation schemes through the European Development Funds (EDF) and Thematic Budget Lines (TBL).

In addition, the EU Water Initiative and the ACP-EU Water Facility programme allocates additional development aid funds for projects in African, Caribbean, and Pacific (ACP) countries, including a number of initiatives in Mozambique.

Water and wastewater provision for Beira and Dondo

Before the construction of the Mutua plant, the inhabitants of Beira and Dondo received water from the irrigation system at the Mafambisse sugar plantation.

""The European Commission is currently financing water and sanitation schemes through the European Development Funds (EDF) and Thematic Budget Lines (TBL).""

This could provide 30,000m³/day and during the dry season, the system was prone to salt-water intrusion, which significantly reduced the quality of the potable supply. The new plant has now doubled the amount of drinking water available, pumping 60,000m³/day to the two cities.

The Beira sanitation project is specifically intended to help improve national health by rehabilitating the existing sanitation network and constructing new system elements within the city. The project included the construction of a new wastewater treatment plant comprising of a pre-treatment facility, anaerobic tanks, biological filters, decanters and drying beds.

It also included the repair of 11 pumping stations, four elevation stations, and six outlets to the sea. Renewal of sewers, the reconstruction of 6km of pressure pipes and cleaning of 164km of pipework was also part of the project.

Addressing one of the main goals set out in the National Water Policy, the project was funded as two separate components to cover the detailed design and the construction phase of the work. It forms a central part of a series of major improvements, targeting areas that currently have low water and sanitation coverage, have been hardest hit by HIV / AIDS or are particularly vulnerable to cholera outbreaks.

In addition to the ongoing programme in Beira and Dondo, work is also to be carried out in other parts of Sofala province, along with the cities of Quelimane and Mocuba in Zambezia province and the districts of Buzi, Nhamatanda, Nicoadala and Milange.

According to UNICEF a total of 124 water points had been rehabilitated by August 2006, providing water to around 115,000 people. A further 36 new water points were constructed, benefiting more than 37,000 people.

Education has been identified as a key element in promoting hygiene and improving public health, an element of the UNICEF / EU project supporting both classroom awareness programmes and the creation of ‘sanitation clubs’ in schools. Train-Sea-Coast GPA also runs a separate training programme for wastewater management in Mozambique.

Key players involved with Mozambique’s water projects

The project is sponsored by the Government of Mozambique, being co-ordinated by the National Water Directorate. Funding has been made available from the EC from the 7th and 9th rounds of the European Development Fund and the ACP-EU Water Facility, in collaboration with UNICEF.

Mozambique’s Ministry of Public Works and Housing has overall responsibility for the implementation of wastewater disposal and sanitation, with responsibility for the construction work falling to the National Water Directorate and National Directorate of Public Works.

A consortium comprising of CMC and Conduril carried out the construction work for the Beira Treatment Plant, while Louis Berger and Royal Haskoning served as consultants.

Euromec was subcontracted by CMC to supply equipment, and carry out commissioning, testing and start-up of the facility.

Train-Sea-Coast GPA is an inter-agency collaboration of UNESCO-IHE Institute for Water Education, UN-DOALOS and United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), with funding from the Governments of Belgium, the Netherlands, Ireland, the US, and the Flemish region.

The funds will primarily be utilized in support of water related emergency recovery efforts from damages caused by cyclones Idai and Kenneth in the cities of Beira, Dondo, Tete, Moatize, Nampula, Quelimane, Mocuba and Nacala. These investments will potentially benefit an additional 130,000 people from the original beneficiaries under the Water Services and Institutional Support Project II.

“The damages caused by recent cyclone Idai have placed tremendous pressure on the existing water supply services, leaving thousands of households without adequate water supply, with adverse impacts on public health,” noted Mark Lundell, World Bank Country Director for Mozambique.

The project will fund water production and distribution infrastructure in the cyclone affected cities, including expansion and refurbishment of wellfields, intake, and water treatment facilities, network rehabilitation and expansion, as well as leakages control systems to optimize the water supply service provision. These investments will enable the government to provide services to large numbers of people in low-income brackets of the population in the largest urban areas by reconstructing part of the damaged water supply infrastructures by the cyclone Idai and Kenneth. These activities will increase water supply and reliability, as well as the country’s resilience to droughts and other extreme weather events.

“These cities have been badly affected by heavy rains and floods during cyclone Idai, damaging the existing wellfields and parts of the network,” noted Lizmara Kirchner, Senior Water Supply and Sanitation Specialist and the Bank’s Task Team Leader for the project. “The project will rehabilitate critical infrastructure damaged by cyclone Idai and restore the basic water supply services in the affected areas.”

The additional financing will also help leverage additional resources to finance the planned water supply investments in Nacala. This financing will cover 50 percent of project investment costs, with the other 50 percent to be financed by the Government of Netherlands under its DRIVE Program.

The project is part of the World Bank’s broader regional post cyclone recovery package which comprises a set of operations totaling some $700 million in IDA resources – including up to $545 million from the IDA CRW – to support cyclone response in Malawi, Mozambique and Zimbabwe.

This guide aims to help governments and partners plan for resilient post disaster recovery while contributing to longer term sustainable development. It is based on practices gleaned from country experiences in disaster recovery around the world. Hence, the development of the DRF Guide entailed the development of country-level case studies as well as thematic case studies on disaster recovery.

These case studies have been designed to collect and analyze information on: i) disaster recovery standards and principles adapted by countries for specific disasters; ii) planning efforts for making such recovery efficient, equitable and resilient; iii) policies, institutions and capacities to implement and monitor disaster recovery; and iv) ways and means for translating the gains of resilient recovery into longer-term risk reduction and resilient development.

Importantly, these case studies aim to learn from, and not evaluate, country reconstruction initiatives. Practices learned from each country’s experience will inform the contents of the guide for developing a DRF. Additionally, the case studies examine the planning processes and not the implementation details of recovery experiences.

As such, they do not seek to offer a comprehensive account of the post-disaster recovery program, but instead provide details and insight into the decision-making processes for reconstruction policies and programs.

RECURRING DISASTERS IN MOZAMBIQUE

The three biggest floods recorded in Mozambique happened in the 21st century: the first in 2000/2001, the second flooded Central Mozambique in 2007/2008, and most recently the 2013 floods. By its location on the southeastern coast of Africa, and located downstream from several major rivers, Mozambique is considered to be extremely prone to recurrent natural hazards, namely floods, tropical storms, drought, and earthquakes. Nine of its rivers have sources in neighboring countries, requiring cross-border coordination for early warning alerts. Sixty percent of the population lives along the coastline and are therefore vulnerable to tropical storms.

Economic gains in the country are significantly undermined as a result of recurrent water and weather related hazards; consequent economic losses are estimated to average 1.1 percent of GDP annually. Worse, natural disasters such as floods and cyclones have a lasting impact that affects disproportionally the poorest. The World Bank estimated the relative impact of various shocks on poverty: floods and cyclones were estimated to have the strongest impact at the household level, reducing expenditures by about 32 percent and contributing more than 2 percentage points to the poverty rate. When facing a shock, poor households are often forced to sacrifice their long-term interests for the sake of immediate needs, for example by withdrawing children from school to supplement household labor, or by selling or consuming productive capital. In the long run these coping mechanisms make households poorer and even more vulnerable, and may transmit these adverse effects to future generations through their impact on education and health outcomes1.

The 2000 floods were caused by heavy rainfall in the Southern Africa region that lasted for five weeks, exacerbated by tropical cyclones. For the first time in recorded history, simultaneous and major flooding occurred in all of the major rivers that flow into the Indian Ocean through Mozambique – impacting the population in the southern half of the country, from the Limpopo River basin to Maputo (the capital). The flooding of the Limpopo, Incomati, Umbeluzi, Save, Buzi and Pungue rivers were also one of the costliest disasters in Mozambique’s history. At least 700 people died, up to 650,0002 were displaced and 4.5 million were affected, totaling a quarter of Mozambique’s population. GDP fell from a forecast 7 percent to 1.5 percent.

The rainy season of 2013 recalled the year 2000 in terms of the height to which the flood waters rose, but with much lower impact on the population. Southern Mozambique was again devastated: 30 people died as a direct consequence of floods3 in the Limpopo River basin, and up to 186.000 were evacuated. Damages were estimated to exceed US$250 million; of which 50 percent on the road network and 30 percent in the agricultural sector.

Most of the infrastructure on the Lower Limpopo flood plains was built in the 1950s, before increasingly severe flooding needed to be factored into engineering designs. At the same time, the population of Chókwe has nearly doubled since 1997, and infrastructure development has increased rapidly in the lower Limpopo – making more people and material assets vulnerable to climatic risk.

The impact from the two flood events are compared in Table 1. The sharp decrease in fatality rates and the impact of natural disasters indicates that disasters are being managed more effectively. This reflects lessons learned in the prior decade, including flood forecasting, early warning systems and trans-boundary cooperation. Most importantly, national investment and international cooperation in strengthening institutional capacity and readiness has noticeably reduced the devastating impact of disasters on human lives and housing.","The World Bank’s Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR), the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and the European Union (EU) are working on a guide for developing disaster recovery frameworks (DRF).

When Cristina Matavele, 42, arrived in the village of Mukhomane in Ha hi Kuleni area more than 20 years ago, the nearest water source was over two kilometers. It was a traditional well dug in the riverbed. The same source served for both people and animals.

Today, her daughter enjoy clean just some steps from her home after World Vision drilled a borehole 300 meters away. ""Every day, after returning from the farm, I used to walk the same distance to get water,"" Cristina said, and recalled that, ""We drank the same water from same well with the animals. Several times, we found dead animals inside the well, but we have no other choicebut use the water.

“We only have clean water when it rained and we used to keep in containers"", she added. On 2009, World Vision drilled the first borehole in the village. ""World Vision brought us clean water. Apart from the safe drinking water, we stopped walking for long distances. We have more time to work in the farm and take care of our children,” she said.





“About 283,000 people in Mozambique have access to clean and safe water through facilities built and restored by World Vision since 2012”, said Graham Strong, World Vision’s National Director in Mozambique. The effort has also paved the way for improved health condition for children and their families.Dilze, the youngest of Christina’s three children said, ""I get the water I use to wash my clothes, my school uniform and to take a shower. I also help mom get the water to drink. It is good that we have a water source nearby because I can help my mother and still go to school on time.”""On days that I cannot do it, Dilze takes her can and get water. It is near and does not need too much effort. This would not be possible if she had to do it in the well where we used to fetch it. It was not only far away but also very dangerous for children”, Christina added.World Vision organized and trained the water management committees to maintain the water sources in this community. ""We created the water committee to manage the borehole. Each family contributes an agreed fee per month for the maintenance,"" says Jaime Langa, the committee water leader.“These interventions are also accompanied by community mobilization to improve their hygiene and sanitation facilities to prevent waterborne diseases”, Water, Sanitation and Hygiene Specialist Idalina Roia said.

Mozambique is suffering from a large amount of poverty and a severe water crisis with approximately half of its people below the poverty line and being deprived of access to clean, safe water. A shocking 75% of its people do not have access to adequate sanitation.

Due to the lack of development here, it has meant that the people still have not been able to access clean, safe water. Those in Mozambique’s rural areas are the most greatly effected by the water crisis. There are several water sources across Mozambique, however many of them have broken down or do not provide clean water. The major reasons for the breakdown of these current water sources include: poor maintenance systems, a lack of spare parts and a continued reliance on old, unclean pumps. Mozambique do not have the capital or resources to build and maintain water sources which provide a constant stream of clean water to its people.

Due to the lack of accessible water sources, a large number of Mozambique’s rural population rely on natural water sources (such as ponds, rivers and hand dug wells). With Mozambique’s recent lack of rain fall and prolonged periods of drought, many have not been able to rely on these natural water sources. This has resulted in communities having to travel greater distances to access water, putting available water sources under greater pressure. The need to travel greater distances to search for water is resulting in many children dropping out of school or regularly being absent. They are having to spend their days walking miles to find water instead of being in the classroom. Diseases are also a lot more common during drought periods. Droughts result in a reduced amount of drinking water leading to a lack of hygiene and sanitation. This causes diseases to be more easily spread.

Water is crucial for the growth of Mozambique’s economy. Agriculture contributes to over a quarter of Mozambique’s GDP making water necessary to maintain the country’s agricultural production. Water is also vital for Mozambique to grow crops to feed its population. Due to the lack of water, a huge amount of crops have died, resulting in the people going hungry, many have even become starving.

Mozambique’s water crisis is a serious problem. Without clean water people are unable to live a healthy lifestyle!","Mozambique’s Water CrisisMozambique is suffering from a large amount of poverty and a severe water crisis with approximately half of its people below the poverty line and being deprived of access to clean, safe water.

“The desalination of seawater for human consumption is a project that is still very premature, but it is one of the possibilities to respond to the crisis that is affecting the region,” João Machatine, Minister of Public Works, Housing and Water Resources is quoted by today’s edition of Notícias as saying.

Desalination would be carried out through a public-private partnership, and the government already has in hand proposals from entities interested in the project.

The lack of water in the Pequenos Libombos Dam which supplies the city and province of Maputo – now only 21% of ideal storage levels – is the result of the absence of rain in the Umbeluzi hydrological basin.

degree of risk: very high food or waterborne diseases: bacterial and protozoal diarrhea, hepatitis A, and typhoid fever vectorborne diseases: malaria and dengue fever water contact diseases: schistosomiasis animal contact diseases: rabies

Definition: This entry lists major infectious diseases likely to be encountered in countries where the risk of such diseases is assessed to be very high as compared to the United States. These infectious diseases represent risks to US government personnel traveling to the specified country for a period of less than three years. The degree of risk is assessed by considering the foreign nature of these infectious diseases, their severity, and the probability of being affected by the diseases present. The diseases listed do not necessarily represent the total disease burden experienced by the local population.

The risk to an individual traveler varies considerably by the specific location, visit duration, type of activities, type of accommodations, time of year, and other factors. Consultation with a travel medicine physician is needed to evaluate individual risk and recommend appropriate preventive measures such as vaccines.

Diseases are organized into the following six exposure categories shown in italics and listed in typical descending order of risk. Note: The sequence of exposure categories listed in individual country entries may vary according to local conditions.

food or waterborne diseases acquired through eating or drinking on the local economy:

Hepatitis A - viral disease that interferes with the functioning of the liver; spread through consumption of food or water contaminated with fecal matter, principally in areas of poor sanitation; victims exhibit fever, jaundice, and diarrhea; 15% of victims will experience prolonged symptoms over 6-9 months; vaccine available.

Hepatitis E - water-borne viral disease that interferes with the functioning of the liver; most commonly spread through fecal contamination of drinking water; victims exhibit jaundice, fatigue, abdominal pain, and dark colored urine.

Typhoid fever - bacterial disease spread through contact with food or water contaminated by fecal matter or sewage; victims exhibit sustained high fevers; left untreated, mortality rates can reach 20%.

vectorborne diseases acquired through the bite of an infected arthropod:

Malaria - caused by single-cell parasitic protozoa Plasmodium; transmitted to humans via the bite of the female Anopheles mosquito; parasites multiply in the liver attacking red blood cells resulting in cycles of fever, chills, and sweats accompanied by anemia; death due to damage to vital organs and interruption of blood supply to the brain; endemic in 100, mostly tropical, countries with 90% of cases and the majority of 1.5-2.5 million estimated annual deaths occurring in sub-Saharan Africa.

Dengue fever - mosquito-borne (Aedes aegypti) viral disease associated with urban environments; manifests as sudden onset of fever and severe headache; occasionally produces shock and hemorrhage leading to death in 5% of cases.

Yellow fever - mosquito-borne viral disease; severity ranges from influenza-like symptoms to severe hepatitis and hemorrhagic fever; occurs only in tropical South America and sub-Saharan Africa, where most cases are reported; fatality rate is less than 20%.

Japanese Encephalitis - mosquito-borne (Culex tritaeniorhynchus) viral disease associated with rural areas in Asia; acute encephalitis can progress to paralysis, coma, and death; fatality rates 30%.

African Trypanosomiasis - caused by the parasitic protozoa Trypanosoma; transmitted to humans via the bite of bloodsucking Tsetse flies; infection leads to malaise and irregular fevers and, in advanced cases when the parasites invade the central nervous system, coma and death; endemic in 36 countries of sub-Saharan Africa; cattle and wild animals act as reservoir hosts for the parasites.

Cutaneous Leishmaniasis - caused by the parasitic protozoa leishmania; transmitted to humans via the bite of sandflies; results in skin lesions that may become chronic; endemic in 88 countries; 90% of cases occur in Iran, Afghanistan, Syria, Saudi Arabia, Brazil, and Peru; wild and domesticated animals as well as humans can act as reservoirs of infection.

Plague - bacterial disease transmitted by fleas normally associated with rats; person-to-person airborne transmission also possible; recent plague epidemics occurred in areas of Asia, Africa, and South America associated with rural areas or small towns and villages; manifests as fever, headache, and painfully swollen lymph nodes; disease progresses rapidly and without antibiotic treatment leads to pneumonic form with a death rate in excess of 50%.

Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever - tick-borne viral disease; infection may also result from exposure to infected animal blood or tissue; geographic distribution includes Africa, Asia, the Middle East, and Eastern Europe; sudden onset of fever, headache, and muscle aches followed by hemorrhaging in the bowels, urine, nose, and gums; mortality rate is approximately 30%.

Rift Valley fever - viral disease affecting domesticated animals and humans; transmission is by mosquito and other biting insects; infection may also occur through handling of infected meat or contact with blood; geographic distribution includes eastern and southern Africa where cattle and sheep are raised; symptoms are generally mild with fever and some liver abnormalities, but the disease may progress to hemorrhagic fever, encephalitis, or ocular disease; fatality rates are low at about 1% of cases.

Chikungunya - mosquito-borne (Aedes aegypti) viral disease associated with urban environments, similar to Dengue Fever; characterized by sudden onset of fever, rash, and severe joint pain usually lasting 3-7 days, some cases result in persistent arthritis.

water contact diseases acquired through swimming or wading in freshwater lakes, streams, and rivers:

Leptospirosis - bacterial disease that affects animals and humans; infection occurs through contact with water, food, or soil contaminated by animal urine; symptoms include high fever, severe headache, vomiting, jaundice, and diarrhea; untreated, the disease can result in kidney damage, liver failure, meningitis, or respiratory distress; fatality rates are low but left untreated recovery can take months.

Schistosomiasis - caused by parasitic trematode flatworm Schistosoma; fresh water snails act as intermediate host and release larval form of parasite that penetrates the skin of people exposed to contaminated water; worms mature and reproduce in the blood vessels, liver, kidneys, and intestines releasing eggs, which become trapped in tissues triggering an immune response; may manifest as either urinary or intestinal disease resulting in decreased work or learning capacity; mortality, while generally low, may occur in advanced cases usually due to bladder cancer; endemic in 74 developing countries with 80% of infected people living in sub-Saharan Africa; humans act as the reservoir for this parasite.

aerosolized dust or soil contact disease acquired through inhalation of aerosols contaminated with rodent urine:

Lassa fever - viral disease carried by rats of the genus Mastomys; endemic in portions of West Africa; infection occurs through direct contact with or consumption of food contaminated by rodent urine or fecal matter containing virus particles; fatality rate can reach 50% in epidemic outbreaks.

respiratory disease acquired through close contact with an infectious person:

Meningococcal meningitis - bacterial disease causing an inflammation of the lining of the brain and spinal cord; one of the most important bacterial pathogens is Neisseria meningitidis because of its potential to cause epidemics; symptoms include stiff neck, high fever, headaches, and vomiting; bacteria are transmitted from person to person by respiratory droplets and facilitated by close and prolonged contact resulting from crowded living conditions, often with a seasonal distribution; death occurs in 5-15% of cases, typically within 24-48 hours of onset of symptoms; highest burden of meningococcal disease occurs in the hyperendemic region of sub-Saharan Africa known as the ""Meningitis Belt"" which stretches from Senegal east to Ethiopia.

animal contact disease acquired through direct contact with local animals:

Rabies - viral disease of mammals usually transmitted through the bite of an infected animal, most commonly dogs; virus affects the central nervous system causing brain alteration and death; symptoms initially are non-specific fever and headache progressing to neurological symptoms; death occurs within days of the onset of symptoms.

333,https://www.contagionlive.com/news/working-against-the-clock-to-stop-cholera-in-mozambique,Working Against the Clock to Stop Cholera in Mozambique,"On March 14, 2019, Cyclone Idai, which is being labeled one of the worst tropical cyclones ever to hit Africa, made landfall in Mozambique, leaving flood waters and destruction in its wake.

Although the full impact of the cyclone cannot be definitively measured, the natural disaster has resulted in the destruction and/or flooding of 110,000 homes, resulting in a high number of displaced individuals. Current estimates from the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) indicate that as of March 31, approximately 33,000 individuals have been provided with shelter.

As relief personnel work around the clock to reach individuals in need of food, water, and shelter, a new threat has emerged that is no stranger to natural disaster aftermath—cholera.

“The risk for outbreaks is often presumed to be very high in the chaos that follows natural disasters, a fear likely derived from a perceived association between dead bodies and epidemics. However, the risk factors for outbreaks are associated primarily with population displacement,” John Watson, MBBS, of the World Health Organization (WHO), and colleagues wrote in a perspective in Emerging Infectious Diseases.

According to the Mozambique Ministry of Health, 1052 cases of cholera had been recorded as of April 1. The majority of the cases have been reported in the urban port city of Beira, but cases are also being documented in rural areas where access to clean water is scarce and sanitation systems and infrastructure have been severely damaged. One death has been confirmed in Beira.

OCHA reports that 11 treatment centers have been established in attempts to ward off waterborne diseases. Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontiéres (MSF) reported that their teams are working inside 3 health centers to care for individuals suffering from cholera and other waterborne diseases. It has also been noted that vector-borne diseases, including malaria, have been reported in the aftermath of the cyclone.

Additionally, outside of the treatment centers, MSF has teams running mobile clinics to provide health services to people living in rural areas where damage to roads and flooding has impeded transportation to treatment centers. The mobile health teams comprise doctors, clinical officers, nurses, health promoters, and counselors. They are visiting transit centers where displaced people are sheltering.

MSF East Africa reports that 10 tons of equipment that is needed during a cholera response, including antibiotics, cholera beds, cleaning equipment, infusion and catheters, oral rehydration salts, chlorine, protective clothing, and plastic sheeting, has arrived in Mozambique.

According to the UN, 900,000 cholera vaccines, funded by Gavi, arrived in the African nation on April 2, just in time for a vaccination campaign to begin on April 3. The vaccinations will be introduced in Beira, along with the Dondo district, Nhamatanda district, and Buzi district.

The UN indicates that at-risk communities will initially be given 1 dose of the cholera vaccine providing protection for at least 6 months. The 2 main priorities of WHO are to make a second dose of the vaccine available later this year and to prevent people from drinking dirty water

According to the WHO, there are 3 pre-cholera oral vaccines. Shanchol and Euvichol-Plus are reportedly “essentially the same vaccine produced by 2 different manufacturers,” and are the only vaccines available for mass vaccination campaigns through the global oral cholera vaccine stockpile.

The 2 vaccines can be given to all individuals over the age of 1 year. There must be a minimum of 2 weeks’ delay between each dose and 2 doses of either vaccine will provide protection against cholera for 3 years.

Cholera is a growing concern in the cyclone aftermath, with nearly 260 cases reported in a 24-hour window on April 1. Although cholera is quick to spread, it is also quick to kill—death can occur in just a few short hours when left untreated. But as health teams work around, and against, the clock to intervene before the disease becomes deadly, there is hope. Up to 80% of cases can be successfully resolved through treatment with oral rehydration solution.

In October 2017, the Global Task Force on Cholera Control (GTFCC) and partners launched a strategy for cholera control, aiming to reduce cholera deaths by 90% and to eliminate cholera in as many as 20 countries by 2030.

The campaign first focuses on early detection and quick response to containing outbreaks of cholera. Further, the campaign calls on countries to focus on preventing cholera recurrence by focusing on hotspots of cholera and implementing hygiene procedures and encouraging vaccination. To achieve all of this, the GTFCC offers and encourages their partners to provide technical support, advocacy, and resource mobilization.

All too often, travellers abruptly find themselves suffering from a gastrointestinal infection. This condition occurs so regularly that it merits its own name: Traveller’s Diarrhea. The culprits are bacteria, protozoa, viruses, and toxins that are transmitted through contaminated food and water, and poor hand hygiene practices.

Food and water-borne illnesses can occur in any country. When we are travelling, we are more likely to be unfamiliar with our food – we won’t always know where it came from, how it was prepared, or who handled it. Some of us are also more inclined to take risks by trying local delicacies and eating from various food vendors. You can prevent gastrointestinal infections when you know the risks, make safe choices, and practice good hygiene. The golden rule is: Boil it, Cook it, Peel it, or Forget it!

Drinking water safety

Always exercise caution with your drinking water. In areas where hygiene and sanitation are challenging to maintain, taking precautions with drinking water is essential.

Is the tap water safe?

Tap water quality and access to clean drinking water varies from region to region. The safety of the drinking water at your destination depends on context-specific factors such as the local supply and distribution system as well as the monitoring and enforcement of water quality standards.

Water quality can be affected by:

Lack of safe water storage

Old pipes or water treatment systems

Poor sanitation infrastructure

Agricultural run-off

Chemical pollutants

Human or animal waste

Weather-related events such as flooding

Even slight changes in water composition can cause Traveller’s Diarrhea. For example, tap water at your destination will have no ill effect on the local population, but due to different treatment standards there may be higher concentrations or unfamiliar strains of E.coli bacteria present. This can cause diarrhea since you do not develop immunity during short-term exposure.

How to prevent water-borne illnesses

Boil your water

If you are unsure about the tap water quality at your destination, bring the water to a rolling boil. Boiling your water destroys pathogens that can cause gastrointestinal infections such as E. coli, Giardia, and Cryptosporidium. Let your water cool in a covered container overnight and pour it into your reusable water bottle before heading out for the day.

Treated water

Water disinfection methods such as filtration, ultraviolet (UV) light and chemical disinfection can be used if there is no heating source to boil water. To learn about different treatment methods, see the following resource:

Bottled water

Bottled water is another option. However, bottles may be outdated or tampered with. Bottled water is also a large contributor to pollution and contributes to the water crisis. If you do purchase bottled water, do so from a reputable source and check that the bottle cap is properly sealed.

Food safety

Always exercise caution when eating high risk foods. Reduce your risk of illness by practicing food safety and following good hand hygiene practices at your destination.

How food becomes contaminated

Exposure to contaminated food is a common source of gastrointestinal illnesses. Before we eat our food, it encounters growers, processors, storage facilities, retailers, and food handlers that can introduce pathogens such as e. coli, Clostridium botulinum, and salmonella. Contamination can also occur through:

Washing food with untreated water

Cross-contamination of raw and cooked items

Improper cooking, storage, and refrigeration

Unsanitary cooking tools and utensils

Poor hand hygiene

How to prevent food-borne illnesses

High risk foods

Due to increased risk of contamination, travellers should practice caution with the following foods:

Undercooked or raw meat, poultry, seafood, fish, and eggs

Unpeeled fruits, vegetables and leafy greens

Unpasteurized dairy products

Foods that have been unrefrigerated or uncovered for a long time such as buffets

Furthermore, it’s not just about what you eat, it’s also important to consider where you eat. It’s not always easy to know if a restaurant or food vendor follows proper food handling and hygienic practices such as properly cleaning cutting boards and utensils, regularly washing their hands, or correctly refrigerating food. Avoid restaurants and food vendors that appear unclean or that don’t have many customers.

Hand hygiene

Hand washing is key to preventing gastrointestinal infections. Inadvertently ingesting fecal matter, protozoa eggs, bacteria or viruses by touching the mouth with dirty or improperly washed hands is a common source of illness. Always ensure that you wash your hands thoroughly before handling food and after using the bathroom.

See the following resources for more information:

Food Allergies

Travelling with a food allergy? Being prepared is important to prevent an allergic reaction or anaphylactic shock during your trip. See the following resources for more information:

Seafood and shellfish poisoning

Marine foods are a common source of food poisoning that can occur in any country due to the availability of these products (fresh or frozen) around the world. See the following resources for more information:

The cyclone's heavy rains, which killed at least 750 people in Mozambique and neighboring Malawi and Zimbabwe, have also pushed dam retention levels to near maximums.

Mozambique said after heavy rains from Cyclone Idai, the water level behind the Cahora Bassa Dam, the fourth largest in Africa, is above recommended levels, raising the possibility that a discharge might be required to relieve growing pressure.

In addition to Cahora Bassa, there are concerns about dams in neighboring countries such as Chagwa in Malawi and Kariba in Zimbabwe that are also close to their maximum capacity.

A large release of water could worsen the already dire situation for many downstream who were hammered earlier this month by the cyclone.

Workers offload food aid from a South African National Defense Force helicopter in the aftermath of Cyclone Idai in Buzi, near Beira, Mozambique, March 25, 2019.

Nysui said evacuations are needed as he fears the structural integrity of the dams could be a problem if water pressure grows.

He said with the forecast of rainfall until April, there may be need for a discharge, worsening the flooding. Therefore, said Nyusi, there is an urgent need to evacuate populations from risk areas until the situation stabilizes.

The Red Cross said Cyclone Idai has made 400,000 people homeless in Mozambique. On Monday, Mozambique's Land and Environment Minister said 128,000 are living in makeshift camps.

336,https://reliefweb.int/report/mozambique/protecting-small-farms-mozambique-drought,Protecting Small Farms in Mozambique From Drought - Mozambique,"Project Aims to Halt Cycle of Hunger and Poverty

By Alex Russell on April 22, 2019 in Food and Agriculture

During the months that Jonathan Malacarne spent traveling from village to village in rural Mozambique, the weather could be dry and dusty or soaking wet from heavy rain. Either way, people from the community would walk and ride bikes from miles away to meet under the shade of a tree or in a classroom to learn about insured maize seeds.

Malacarne, a Ph.D. candidate at the University of California, Davis, is part of a team of agricultural economists testing whether these insured seeds can increase food security for farmers who regularly risk losing crops to extreme weather. In Mozambique, this includes flooding from a rare but catastrophic cyclone like Idai in 2019 but is more likely to be extreme drought that can strike in any year.

“Drought is definitely among the most frequently cited and most severe concerns that households have,” Malacarne said. “Heavy reliance on a rain-fed staple crop in a drought-prone region with limited access to financial services all translate into high levels of food insecurity pretty quickly.”

The lasting impacts of drought

Small-scale farmers in Mozambique may plant a handful of crops but maize, or corn, is their main staple. Most often maize is ground into meal and cooked into xima, a stiff porridge. For many farmers, maize is their only source of income.

Increasing how much maize farmers can grow, even despite drought, would go a long way toward making households more food secure. According to the World Bank, about 30 percent of the population in Mozambique is undernourished.

One of the challenges is that farmers in Mozambique mostly plant local seeds saved from last year’s crop. The seeds cost nothing but require regular rain until the cobs mature. Farmers who instead spend money on improved, drought-tolerant seeds will get much bigger harvests, especially if there is a moderate drought. But, if the rains never come at all, the farmer who paid for better seeds will lose more.

“If you spend all your money on seeds that are expensive to buy and then they fail anyway, there’s nothing left to get your family through to the next season,” Malacarne said. Malacarne first learned about these kinds of constraints as a Peace Corps volunteer in Nicaragua before he joined the Ph.D. program in agricultural and resource economics at UC Davis.

For small-scale farmers, a severe drought can lead to impacts that last well beyond a single season. Families might sell some of what they own, like livestock or tools, making it harder to start over the next season. Another option is to skip meals, which can compromise adults’ ability to work or stunt the growth and development of their children.

“These circumstances can quickly push families to a tipping point after which they will always be poor, with no chance to build back the assets they need to escape poverty,” said Michael Carter, a professor of agricultural and resource economics at UC Davis and director of the Feed the Future Innovation Lab for Assets and Market Access.

Carter has been studying these dynamics for decades. He believes one way to disrupt them is for farmers to increase their assets. In Mozambique, where there is little opportunity to earn outside of agriculture, this means growing more maize. However, this requires risking cash that would sustain the family in a severe drought.

“Reducing this risk is one way of shifting the tipping point, which reduces the intervention needed to help households escape chronic poverty and possibly even develop some resilience to the next shock that comes along,” Carter said.

Adding insurance to seeds to increase overall drought protection

Since as early as 2014, Carter and Travis Lybbert, also a professor of agricultural and resource economics at UC Davis, have wanted to test whether bundling drought-tolerant seeds with insurance could overcome the limitations of the seeds alone.

“Seeds that enhance the resilience of farmers facing drought has been probably the most popular public and private crop investment in the past 20 years,” Lybbert said. “Adding insurance expands this resilience to include even the worst possible outcomes.”

In 2015, with support from USAID, Carter, Lybbert and Stephen Boucher, also a professor of agricultural and resource economics at UC Davis, launched a study to test how bundling seeds and insurance would actually work in Tanzania and Mozambique.

The UC Davis team partnered with CIMMYT, a nonprofit research center based in Mexico that has spent decades selectively breeding maize seeds that can withstand some drought. They also developed an index insurance that would replace the seeds in the event of a severe enough drought.

Index insurance is a type of insurance that avoids the cost of verifying losses by basing payouts on an easy-to-measure index of factors, such as weather or average yields. In Mozambique, seed replacements would trigger when satellite data showed a lack of rain early in the season or when full-season rainfall and vegetation growth estimated that crops had failed.

“In the extreme case, families can lose everything, even seed for next year,” Malacarne said. “Being able to start over with improved seed is a big deal, and they’re also learning about how insurance works.”

Taking a new kind of drought protection from village to village

In Mozambique, Malacarne would watch as members of the survey team gave their presentation on the drought-tolerant seeds and insurance either in Portuguese, the national language in Mozambique, or in one of the local languages like Shona or Ndao.

Toward the end of the presentations, when it came time to make sure everyone understood the index insurance that would guarantee the seeds, each attendee held two cards, one red, one green. Everyone in the village has a good harvest? Green card, no replacement. Had a bad harvest but most neighbors had a good one? Green card, no replacement. Almost everyone had a bad harvest? Red card, replacement.

No one in these parts of Mozambique, about six hours from the nearest major city, had any experience with insurance. But everyone understood drought. They also understood community. When the research team designed the contract zones, they were careful to keep communities together.

“In these areas the community is the unit of organization generally,” Malacarne said. “That everybody in the community would get the same payment made sense.”

In the time Malacarne spent in Mozambique, he and his team, along with seed company representatives and local agricultural extension workers, visited 69 communities. In addition to the presentations, the team gathered three rounds of hourlong, one-on-one surveys with about 1,500 farmers to measure the bundle’s impact.

For all the time Malacarne spent in Mozambique, he mostly knows the farmers there through the data collected in those surveys. It’s a different experience than he had in Nicaragua, where he worked with individual farmers over a long period of time and could see firsthand the challenges they face.

“We are trying to learn things that are going to guide policy in a way that impacts a lot of people but not necessarily these specific people,” Malacarne said.

Though the research team has just completed its final round of surveys, early analysis shows that the project worked exactly as it was designed. In 2017, when a severe drought struck in Tanzania, the insurance triggered the replacement of 1,220 packets of seed. In Mozambique, higher yields were driven by only moderate periods of drought but good seasons overall.

Across both countries, over 2,000 households bought drought-tolerant seeds and nearly 1,000 bought the seeds bundled with insurance. Farmers who bought the improved seeds, with or without insurance, had higher yields by about 380 kg per hectare. That’s about 50 percent more maize than farmers without the improved seeds could grow.

This success could lead to farmers continuing purchasing the improved seeds, and also insurance if the project’s partners in both countries continue to make it available. “In order to help people to solve the problems they face in a way that makes sense for them, you have to understand what those decisions look like through their eyes,” Malacarne said. “That’s what research does.”

In Mozambique alone, Cyclone Idai killed more than 600 people, damaged over 200,000 homes, and left over 1.85 million people in need of urgent humanitarian assistance.

When the super storm struck it destroyed Luisa Mungono’s house. She had to live in a makeshift house together with her husband and nine children. The cyclone destroyed over 715,000 hectares in Mozambique’s central breadbasket region just weeks before the main harvest. 40-year old Luisa said:

""The water came and all our rice, maize and all the seeds that we had were washed away, What was there was eaten by worms after the rain soaked our fields.""

Just weeks later, Mozambique was hit by a second cyclone Kenneth. Communities are now facing severe food shortages after prolonged drought, flooding and the devastating impact of the cyclones on huge areas of farmland.

""Cyclone Idai destroyed large areas of farmland across Mozambique. There were donations of seeds as part of recovery efforts, but once they were planted we had an infestation of the fall armyworm pest, which again destroyed the crops,"" says Gasper Sitefane, country director, ActionAid Mozambique.

""On top of that, the rainy season is delayed and it is causing panic among the population. Rains were expected in October, but they still have not come.

“The weather forecasts are showing that areas hit by Cyclone Idai will be affected by flooding, while the southern areas will continue to face drought, which has been affecting the region bordering Zimbabwe for two years.

“It is becoming a dire issue. Water is becoming so scarce, people are selling off their cattle because they cannot survive.”

The Mozambican Government’s Disaster Management Technical Council (CTGC) on January 16th, 2016 declared an orange alert, only one step from the maximum state of disaster readiness, a red alert. The move was prompted by a combination of torrential rains that caused floods in the north of the country while the southern part was castigated by a severe drought.

The National Institute for Disaster Management (INGC) general director, João Machatine, said that about 13 million US Dollars is required monthly for assistance to victims of drought in Mozambique. Machatine was speaking in Maputo, on April 04, at a meeting with development partners, including UN Agencies among them UNDP, FAO, UNICEF and WFP. The event served to exchange ideas as well as mobilize resource to further support the joint emergency response plan.

According to INGC there is need for urgent action as this recent data has revealed that the number of people experiencing food insecurity is high compared to the number of people being assisted - 315,000 people, a number which the institution had based its estimated response needs, Machatine explained.

At the meeting, the Government requested the partners to inform within a week on what they are or will be able to contribute to support the drought response. With regard to floods, Machatine said the phenomenon has affected 10,000 people, but the situation is under control.

Mozambique is among other drought affected countries in the region including South Africa, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Malawi, Madagascar and Namibia, with significantly poorly distributed seasonal rainfall since October 2015.

According to the Famine Early Warning System Network (FEWS NET), the ongoing El Niño has resulted in a severe drought across Southern Africa. Rains, which typically begin in October/November, have been 10 to more than 50 days late and significantly below average. This poor rainfall, in combination with above-average temperatures, has limited crop development, pasture regrowth, and water availability.

Announcing the situation overview in the country during a press conference in Maputo, the Minister of Health affirmed that “of the five (5) cases confirmed, four (4) are imported and one (1) is a local transmission. All patients are in self-quarantine at home being followed-up by medical teams.”

The tests were carried out in Portugal by private laboratories in the scope of the public-private partnership with the Government of Mozambique. Until this date, all COVID-19 tests were conduct only by the Virology Laboratory of the National Public Health Institute in Maputo. In Mozambique, the Virology Laboratory is part of the network of laboratories of the World Health Organization (WHO) that can undertake viral respiratory infections tests.

“Today, the Laboratory of the National Health Institute has carried out 10 tests and all test results are negative to COVID-19”, stressed the Minister of Health.

The Minister informed that the technical-scientific commission established by H.E. President Filipe Jacinto Nyusi on 20 March 20, to advise the Government in taking decision on the pandemic, has taken office and has met for the first time. The Minister revealed that the commission, in its first meeting, reiterated the preventive measures announced by the Head of State last Friday.

While there is still much to learn about COVID-19, people can take actions to prevent the disease through simple, day-to-day measures. These include regular hand washing with soap and water; coughing into a tissue or a bent elbow, being sure to safely dispose of the tissue afterwards; maintaining a social distance of at least one meter, particularly if that person is coughing; avoiding touching the eyes, nose and mouth; and seeking medical attention early if a person develops a fever or cough.

341,https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/12/131206091425.htm,Water pollution in Mozambique,"During her PhD project, Olivia Carolina Narciso Pedro has studied the incidence of cyanobacteria and the production of microcystins (toxic peptides) in three different drinking water systems in Mozambique and established methods for monitoring cyanotoxins in watercourses.

Mozambique is a developing country where the majority of the population still lacks access to safe drinking water, in spite of the fact that there is sufficient water to cover their needs. The primary source of water pollution is effluent from households, agriculture and industry, but the growing interest in exploiting natural gas, metals and other resources in the coastal areas of the country is also increasing the risk of polluted drinking water. In addition, it is thought that higher temperatures resulting from global climate changes can lead to an increase in the runoff of nutrients into surface water, which in turn intensifies the eutrophication of lakes and the blooming of cyanobacteria.

The blooming of cyanobacteria is a serious pollution problem because many species of these bacteria produce toxic components, so-called cyanotoxins. A higher incidence of cyanobacteria has been detected in drinking water reservoirs and both bacteria cells and dissolved toxins can be found in the drinking water. The largest group of cyanotoxins are called microcystins and increased attention is now being paid to these because they can have a negative effect on human health.

Chronic exposure to microcystins can cause serious health problems for animals and humans, for example damage to the liver. Humans are exposed to these toxins by drinking polluted water and also via direct skin contact and inhalation. An intense growth of toxin-producing bacteria in drinking water can also have detrimental effects on the environment and the economy. Microcystins therefore pose a serious problem for the population and the authorities. In order to reduce these problems, an effective management of the drinking water systems, which is capable of monitoring cyanobacterial blooms and their toxins, is required.

Olivia Pedro's doctoral research has helped to increase knowledge about the occurrence of microcystins and microcystin-producing cyanobacteria in freshwater used for drinking in Mozambique. She conducted her studies by taking samples from three different areas in southern Mozambique: the Pequenos Libombos dam, the Nhambavale lake and the Chòkwé irrigation canal. The first two are the main sources of drinking water for the population in Maputo and Chidenguel respectively, while the Chòkwé canal is principally used for irrigation. By means of various chemical and molecular methods, Pedro found concentrations of microcystins that were far higher than WHO's recommendations for the content of drinking water. She also discovered that there were seasonal variations in bacteria blooms and the production of toxins.

This PhD thesis is significant because it is the first to show that there is a connection in Mozambique between the season and the amount of cyanobacteria Microcystis and the concentration of microcystins in freshwater.","Mozambique is a developing country where the majority of the population still lacks access to safe drinking water, in spite of the fact that there is sufficient water to cover their needs.

There is too little to keep people alive, and the lack of it is forcing them from their homes, splitting up families and killing children. Photographer Mário Macilau travelled around his country, talking to people whose only supply of water is from filthy rivers that dry up quickly in the hotter months.

In northern Mozambique’s Niassa province, only 21% of people have access to safe sanitation and just 42% have a clean water supply. Only half the area’s boreholes and wells are operational, forcing women and children to spend a great deal of time walking to fetch water.



Eudicia and Josefina, both 12

Eudicia lives in Muassi village. She and her friend Josefina miss school up to four times a week as they have to fetch water from the riverbed.

“Going to collect water is not fun. I’m not happy because it’s too far. I’m not laughing because if I’m just laughing I won’t reach home until night. There are snakes and dogs there,” Eudicia says.



“We go in groups, because we’re afraid to go alone. Carrying the water is too heavy; it is dirty and has a bad smell, like grass or old leaves … Even when we do have water to wash, the water is dirty, so if you wash you are not really clean. I feel shy when I am dirty or my clothes are not clean.

“I miss school every other day or so, to collect water. I don’t feel good because I am absent from school.”

My favourite subject is Portuguese … I want to be a teacher, because teachers can receive a good salary Josefina

In Mozambique, the statistics are stark: 14.8 million people have no clean water, and more than 21 million are without a safe place to go to the toilet. Women and children make long, exhausting journeys to collect dirty water for their families. A lack of private toilets in schools causes many girls to leave when they start menstruating. Health centres are overcrowded and have inadequate sanitation. All of this leads to disease outbreaks: seven of every 100 children die before turning five.

Eudicia’s best friend is Josefina, 12 (left). “My favourite subject is Portuguese, and then social sciences. I want to be a teacher, because teachers can receive a good salary.



“I go to the river three times in a day,” she says. She fetches water for her family every other day. And because the river is far away, it means she has to miss school. “I’m not feeling happy, I don’t feel good about missing school.

“I have seven siblings, four girls and three boys. My best friend is Eudicia … We go to the river together. We have a game called namudóze. We make a circle on the ground and then throw a stone in the air. While the stone is in the air you have to move a small stone on the ground into the circle, then catch the stone that you threw on the way down. You keep going until you reach 12 stones in the circle. Sometimes Eudicia wins, sometimes I win.

Josefina says she does not want to get married yet. “I want to wait. Next year I will go to grade six in Etatara. I’ll still live at home, but I’ll have to walk to school there. It’s far! My father supports me to go to school. He says, ‘Don’t be absent from school. You go to school to get a job.’”

Madalena Wissiquisse, 52

Wissiquisse is a nahaco, a healer who cures using a combination of spiritual methods and herbal medicines, and is thought to possess magical powers.

Her husband died six years ago. “Ever since the day he passed away we have been suffering a lot … I have a lot of children.

“My job as a nahaco I only do when people come to my house and ask me. No one taught me. My late grandfather told me in a dream to come to the bush, so when I went there they were telling me to do this and that, and that’s how I learned.

The water situation here is bad. Even at the river we are fighting with each other to get water Wissiquisse

“There is a spiritual connection to the river. When I go down to the river and ask the spirits for things, they give it to me. The same way that Christians go to church and pray to God to ask for things. We believe there are spirits in the river who will give us these things.

She says the most common thing women come to her about is when they are having trouble conceiving. “I give them some medicines, which they take home to help them.

“Another problem is HIV. But I only give medicines for diseases like gonorrhoea or syphilis. To treat HIV properly, I can’t do it, so I tell them to go to the hospital.



“This kind of diarrhoea here – because of the water, I can’t treat it … When someone has a problem with their stomach from the water, they go to the hospital.

“The water situation here is bad. Even at the river we are fighting with each other to get water. Someone can go and take water and another one can come back without any. They are fighting because everyone wants to be the first to take water, so they come and say I should take it first, and then someone else comes and says they should take it first, and they start fighting.



“Because of this water problem I am suffering a lot. See all these children here – there is only that one small hole for water, for everyone to drink and to bathe. So it’s a big problem for us, and that’s why people fight.

“When you bring water here, things will change. It will be good, many people will not suffer because of sickness any more.”



Rogério, 14

“I live here in M’mele, in my grandfather’s house. My grandmother and my younger brother also live there, but he’s sick. I used to go to school but now I don’t go, I just decided myself not to go any more, mainly because of walking. I couldn’t always manage to walk there with the stick, because my leg was always hurting.

“When I was a small baby, we were running away from the war and someone shot at my leg, that’s why that leg is gone now. I was with my mother when we were running, I was in her arms. My mother died. Then later, in a following year, my father also died from diarrhoea.

“I am not thinking about them that much, only my mother because I miss her. For now I mostly don’t think anything.

“The problems here are getting water and food. It’s difficult to get water from the river, even for my grandmother it’s very difficult. She has a problem with her fingers. I can’t manage to go to the river to get water myself because of my leg. In this village there’s a big problem with water. We only get water from the river, and it’s far. It’s not clean water, it’s not good.

“I’m afraid … that water killed my father, so I’m scared to drink it, but I have to.



“I go to the toilet in the bush. It’s not that far. Its not a big problem. Sometimes I get shit on myself because of the way I have to squat on my foot. And sometimes I am not happy about it because other people have two legs and I only have one, so it’s easier for them. Sometimes I am sad. I would be happy if you built a nice toilet here.

“I get sick maybe once or twice a month. I don’t always go to the hospital, because there is no one to carry me there. If someone had a bicycle they could carry me, but no one around here has a bicycle.”

Suzana Tomola, 67, Rogério’s grandmother

“Rogério has lived here for nine years. My daughter Delphinia was coming here in a car with him when they were attacked by bandits. They just started shooting, and the bullets went through my daughter and into his leg. My daughter died there, and they took Rogério to the hospital. Those bandits stole everybody’s things from the car, and then they burned it. The burnt-out car is still there, outside of Cuamba in a place called Patricio.

“To get water you have to go down to the river, where you just wait and wait, and then you have to carry it back. I am the one who has to get water. I go when the sun goes down only, because of the heat. Because of my legs I cannot go there very fast.”

Paolo Tankene, 80, Rogério’s grandfather, has dementia. He now lives alone as his wife can no longer cope with looking after him

Her surviving daughter, Arminda, comes by to help when she can. “Arminda is the one who carries Rogério to the hospital and back, brings food and does some cooking. She comes once a week.

“My husband can only sit and is thinking and thinking – his mind is not right because of thinking too much, trying to remember how to get back to the farm, how to do the work again. But he can’t remember how to do it. He fell down here in the house and hit his head, and that is when his problems started. That was about two years ago.”

Maria Nimolia

Maria Nimolia is in her 80s. “Water has affected me too much,” she says. “Even when I ask children to collect water for me they just refuse, so that’s why I’m here today by myself. This water doesn’t really make me sick. I know that other people have problems with sickness from this water, but I seem to be OK.



“I can’t do any farming work any more, but I still go to the fields to keep some people company. Usually I just sit, nothing else. I clean and tidy my house.

When I ask children to collect water for me they refuse Maria Nimolia

“I don’t know how old I am, but I’ve lived here all my life. No one told me when I was born – I was a baby so I can’t remember. I live with my husband, Simon Jorge. I don’t know how old he is either. My son also lives with us, I think he’s about 30. I have seven children all together, but they live with their own families now.”



Her son-in-law José Witiness explains why she doesn’t know how old she is: “When the Portuguese colonised us here, they only accepted people who were rich to go to school. That is why older people here can’t read or write – they don’t know their ages or what year it is, and they can’t speak Portuguese. Their births were not necessarily registered, so sometimes they don’t even have an identity card. They were just living here in the bush and no one cared about them.”



“She has lost family, but she just can’t explain it.

“I was sick with cholera, and I had to go to the hospital to be treated. It happened because we didn’t have a clean place. The water here was so bad because the environment was dirty.

In the township of Chamanculo, in Maputo, Mozambique, a network of household taps made the community water pump obsolete years ago, freeing residents from the daily burden of lugging massive jerrycans of water long distances.

But a water crisis, partly caused by an ongoing drought affecting much of southern Africa, is already reversing progress in this coastal city. An emergency “orange alert”, declared last February by the country’s disaster management council after failed rains, has triggered such strict water rationing across the capital city that the taps are turned off every other day and irrigation is banned.

Unable to afford the private wells, boreholes and extra tanks used by the rich to buffer themselves from the restrictions, Chamanculo’s residents once again find themselves gathering at a single tap. At 9am, a steady stream of mostly women, some with babies strapped to their backs, line up at Pragosa, a Portuguese construction firm, which is providing free water from a private borehole to the community during the emergency for an hour every day. They fill up 25-litre canisters and carefully balance them on their heads, often making repeat trips home and back again.

Helena Metela, 20, a mother of a three-month-old boy, Ali, says it is a struggle but she has no choice. “The construction company is a little bit far from my home,” she says. “It takes time. Maybe an hour.”

With no end to the current water shortage in sight, the municipality is considering bringing back community pumps to deal with the dwindling supply.

Unlike Cape Town, in neighbouring South Africa where the water supply is at breaking point, Maputo has not got to the stage where officials have predicted a “day zero”, when taps are forecast to run dry. But it is clear that without urgent action, Maputo could be the next southern African city to suffer extreme water shortages. Worse still, future projections are for the city to double in size, from 1.7 million people to 3.5million by 2035, sending demand for already scant water resources soaring further.

So pressing is the issue that late last month government departments, water utilities, regulators and NGOs gathered in downtown Maputo for a crisis meeting to discuss possible solutions. At the meeting, held jointly by the Mozambique government and WaterAid, official after official warned that the situation was “critical”.

Nobody present was in any doubt of the role climate change is playing in the water shortages. Meteorologists who talked to the Observer reported shifting rainfall patterns, high temperatures and more extreme weather events in recent years. Predictions are that in Maputo and other coastal cities increased pressure on fresh water supply is set to increase.

Jonathan Farr, a senior policy analyst at Wateraid, said climate change was “eating up the world’s water”, while also making it harder to find a solution. “Things that have worked in the past are no longer enough. Climate change makes everything considerably more serious. Cape Town was something you wouldn’t expect to happen. We are now seeing it potentially in Maputo.”

An hour’s drive west from Maputo is the vast Pequenos Libombos dam, which feeds into the Umbeluzi river, the main source of water supply to Greater Maputo. Completed in 1987, the dam has a capacity of 400 million square metres. But in the last two years, the water level has dropped dramatically. Standing on the bridge above the reservoir, Jaime Timba, the dam’s director, points to a series of yellow guages on the dam’s wall, well above the current water level.

“The water level is too low for the scale,” Timba said “We need to build a new one.” It is only the second time in a decade that the water level has been so depleted. The last time was in 2016, when it fell to 13%. Some water restrictions were enacted then, but they were not sufficient. Meanwhile, everyone prayed for more rain.

In the last four years the Umbeluzi river basin has recorded below average rainfall for the whole basin, while evaporation rates have risen, according to Wateraid. Swathes of land across the region, from South Africa to Zambia, have been hit by high temperatures and low rainfall. Though rainfall in Mozambique has been reasonably good elsewhere, Swaziland in the south-west, whose rivers feed into the Pequenos Libombos dam, has suffered.

Jacinto Laureiro, the mayor of Boane, a town in Greater Maputo, said: “We need to change from thinking about the next 10 years or even 20 years, to thinking long term.”

The current situation, he said, had developed over time, due to population growth, a lack of investment in infrastructure measures to capture water, and because of climate change.

Asked if the situation could deteriorate, he said: “Only God knows.”

Antonieta Ruben, 53, a widow, was sceptical that she would see improvements any time soon.

“I don’t have hope,” said Ruben, who has two sons at university in Maputo and sells chickens to support her family. “This is a normal crisis. They can have promises of getting water but nothing is done.”","But it is clear that without urgent action, Maputo could be the next southern African city to suffer extreme water shortages.

MCC’s $447.9 million Mozambique Compact (2008-2013) funded the $187.3 million Urban Water Supply and Drainage and Sanitation Activities of the Water Supply and Sanitation (WSS) Project to improve access to safe water and reduce flooding. The activities rehabilitated and expanded water supply and drainage infrastructure and provided technical assistance, which aimed to reduce the incidence of water-borne diseases and ultimately increase the productivity of individuals and firms.

Evaluator Description MCC commissioned an independent, final performance evaluation of the Urban Water Supply and Drainage and Sanitation Activities of the WSS Project by Mathematica Policy Research. The study assesses implementation, maintenance, and outcomes. Full report results and learning: https://data.mcc.gov/evaluations/index.php/catalog/234.

Key Findings

Capacity, Maintenance, and Sustainability Overall, the Nampula and Nacala city water supply infrastructure was well-maintained and their sustainability was linked to the capacity of the water operator.

Maintenance of drainage has been a challenge, as sanitation companies were not ready for autonomous management. Water Supply Nampula city water supply investments contributed to increased water volume and service hours. However, full intended benefits were limited by the water volume available from the dam itself.

The Nacala Dam investment increased the system’s potential capacity, but water supply to customers continued to be constrained by the incomplete treatment and distribution works. Drainage Residents credit perceived flood reduction to the drainage systems and noted that drains helped water flow off the streets.

Even so, this activity did not seem to affect the prevalence of malaria in Nampula and Quelimane. Households and health workers reported malaria continued to afflict families living nearby. Cost-effectiveness and Lessons Overall, it is doubtful that these investments were cost effective, as key outcomes were non-existent or marginal.

To realize benefits from improved piped water systems, the supply, treatment, and distribution need to be in place.

Infrastructure needed to be paired with sufficient capacity building to ensure sustainability.

Evaluation Questions

This final performance evaluation was designed to answer the following questions:

1

Was the program implemented according to the approved plans and budget? 2

Are the infrastructure investments operational and being appropriately maintained? 3

What were the effects of the urban water supply activity on key outcomes (water supply, reliability, consumption, and expenditure; malaria and diarrhea incidence)? 4

What was the effect of the urban drainage and sanitation activity on key outcomes (drainage capacity, flood incidence and severity, and malaria incidence)? 5

What was the effect of the capacity-building activity on sanitation service delivery? 6

As implemented, were the activities cost-effective? 7

What lessons can MCC or the GoM apply in future programs to program design, implementation, and sustainment of results?

Detailed Findings

Capacity, Maintenance, and Sustainability

Water Supply – The Urban Water Supply and Drainage and Sanitation Activities were largely implemented to the final, rescoped plan, except Nacala city water supply systems, which remain incomplete. The cities of Nampula and Nacala’s water systems remained well-maintained in part due to the high levels of capacity demonstrated by the Mozambican water operator and on-site training provided by the compact. Meanwhile, the city of Mocuba’s works construction quality and constrained resources compromised their lifespan.

Drainage – The drainage and sanitation component was implemented to plan. Nampula and Quelimane drainage remained in working order. However, insufficient technical assistance resulted in municipal sanitation companies unable to autonomously operate and maintain the infrastructure. Communities in Nampula continued to deposit trash in the drains, clogging the canals. Despite these challenges, Quelimane maintained a strong culture of solid waste management that kept the drains clean.

Water Supply

Investments in the Nampula city water supply contributed to growth in water supply, number of water connections, water expenditure, and daily service hours. Even so, the investments failed to reach even half of the intended population and more recently, a rising share in non-revenue water threatened gains made by the compact.

Investments in Nampula aimed to improve health outcomes and increase growth in business. While there were improved health outcomes and more commercial connections post-compact, neither outcomes could be attributed to the compact.

The Nacala Dam increased the potential water supply capacity in Nacala city. However, the accompanying water treatment plant and transmission pipes were not completed due to contractor non-performance—and so, the outcomes from this intervention had not materialized.

The Mocuba works doubled the volume of water available to customers and increased service hours. However a massive flood in 2015 destroyed the bank intake system and shifted the course of the river, negating future benefits.

Drainage

Residents claimed the drainage systems in Quelimane and Nampula reduced flooding—noting shorter duration of flooding and greater mobility during the rainy season. Within Nampula city limits, stakeholders noted that the drainage system helps water flow off the streets.

The infrastructure intended to reduce malaria and other waterborne diseases. While it remains impossible to attribute outcomes to the drainage, data suggests that malaria has not fallen and continues to afflict families living nearby.

Cost-effectiveness and Lessons

Overall, it is doubtful that the Urban Water Supply and Drainage and Sanitation Activities were cost effective, as targeted outcomes in Nacala did not materialize due to incomplete works and were nullified in Mocuba because the works were destroyed by flooding. Similarly, while residents perceived a reduction in flooding after drains were installed in Nampula and Quelimane, the drains’ effects on malaria prevalence were marginal.

To some extent, benefits were not realized because feasibility studies took two years to complete, which shortened the five-year time allotted to implement the works. These studies should be completed before compact signing.

To realize benefits from improved water supply systems, the supply, treatment, and distribution need to be in place. All components are required for success. In Nampula, the urban water interventions improved treatment and distribution, but did not consider supply expansion. In Nacala, the design brought together all components but contractor non-performance on treatment and distribution construction prevented urban water supply investments from reaching its beneficiaries.

In addition, infrastructure should be paired with sufficient capacity building to maintain the infrastructure and maximize benefits. The companies created to manage the drains lack the capacity to maintain investments in the post-compact period.

Finally, outcomes should be linked to data to show results. For example, a critical outcome of the drainage was reduction in flooding, however neither the Government of Mozambique nor the project collected this type of data.

MCC Learning



Future WASH infrastructure investments should be complemented with robust public outreach and behavior change components to be more effective.

Access to utility data should be established as an agreement of the compact itself and should carry over to the post-compact M&E plan.

Evaluation Methods

This performance evaluation uses a mixed-methods approach with three components: an ex-post implementation study; an infrastructure assessment; and a pre-post analysis. The implementation study employs qualitative methods to explore how project funds were used and how and why changes to the design were made. The infrastructure sustainability assessment combines on-site inspections and a review of project documents to draw conclusions about the current status and potential threats to infrastructure sustainability. The pre-post analysis examines outcomes using administrative data from the water utility and the Ministry of Health to examine the potential contribution of the project’s activities to changes in key outcomes. The results of this performance evaluation draw on the following sources of data:

Interviews with over 30 stakeholders involved in the design and implementation of the project and more than 40 households in Nampula and Quelimane.

Documents and administrative records from project stakeholders and implementers.

Administrative data from the utility (2008-2018) and the Ministry of Health (2002-2018).

Direct Observations including site visits to all the infrastructure works implemented by MCA-Mozambique and the offices of the municipal sanitation companies.

Interviews and direct observations were conducted from October 2018 to March 2019, resulting in an exposure period of 60-69 months as measured from the time the interventions were completed.","Program OverviewMCC’s $447.9 million Mozambique Compact (2008-2013) funded the $187.3 million Urban Water Supply and Drainage and Sanitation Activities of the Water Supply and Sanitation (WSS) Project to improve access to safe water and reduce flooding.

The famous Limpopo, the Zambezi and the Save are three of Mozambique’s main rivers. Located on the south-eastern coast of the African continent, the country is exposed to a number of extreme weather events including droughts, floods and tropical cyclones. The economy is largely dependent on agriculture, and communities rely on fishing, livestock keeping and rain-fed farming as important parts of their livelihood.

Destruction to crops from extreme weather and falls in agricultural productivity from drought threaten the food security, health and economic stability of many Mozambicans. The country's three main rivers play a critical role in the occurrence of the double impact of floods and droughts affecting vulnerable communities living along their banks. Consequently, the unique nature of Mozambique provides a useful area in which to explore loss and damage in the context of social vulnerabilities and resilience.

Drought and floods impact livelihoods

Since September 2012, the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI) Mozambique, the CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS) and the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA) through the African Climate Policy Centre (ACPC) have been undertaking a joint research project in Mozambique. This research aims to understand the impact of droughts and floods on maize production and how it leads to loss and damage among rural households in southern and central Mozambique.

Major findings from the study reveal that floods and droughts severely affected the households surveyed. Indeed 86% of the households were severely affected by floods while 84% by droughts,“ said Benjamin Ange Brida, a research fellow at ACPC and the principal investigator of the project.

He further pointed out that communities tend to reside close to the river banks where they are faced with the risks of flooding and are forced to relocate upland to drought prone areas. Due to their low adaptive capacity, communities face challenges recovering from the losses they face as a result of floods and drought.

Watch an interview with Benjamin Ange Brida about the findings of the Mozambique case study

A survey of 303 households was conducted in four districts – Chibuto, Mabote, Caia and Mopeia.The study sites within each district were selected based on the assumption that they represented particular vulnerability and exposure to floods and drought.

Current coping strategies are not enough

“Despite having various coping strategies in place, communities still face acute food security problems,” continued Benjamin Ange Brida.

In spite of the ‘powerlessness discourse’ often used at international level when a disaster occurs, rural communities in Mozambique have developed several coping strategies to deal with floods and droughts. These include: selling assets such as livestock, relying on assistance from social networks that include family and non-governmental organizations and diversifying their income generating activities. However despite these strategies, 48% of households still suffer the negative effects of floods. A significant majority (77%) indicated that their coping strategies did not prevent adverse effects of drought.

The researchers recommend the improvement of irrigation systems as a strategy which government can use to help the communities to cope with the challenges.

Read more about the findings in the below presentation:

What is the role of policy?

According to the study, policymakers need better information, empirical data and analysis of both the challenges and the potential solutions.

During a validation workshop held on 27th March 2014 at the Institute of Agricultural Research of Mozambique (IIAM) in Maputo, participants discussed how the study findings can feed into national policies and ongoing international discussions on loss and damage. Drawn from different provinces, the 19 participants including farmers, NGOs, CGIAR centers, national research and meteorological institutions emphasized the need for improving the downscaling and sharing of early warning information. In her opening remarks, Dr. Siboniso Moyo, the ILRI Regional Representative for Southern Africa emphasized the need for information, robust research and adequate funding. She further pointed out that the findings from the study will provide critical information for planning and decision making.

“This study is the beginning and will form the base for undertaking further research work on assessing the adaptive capacity of communities in Mozambique,” pointed out Dr. James Kinyangi, the Regional Program Leader for CCAFS East Africa, during the workshop.

As a next step, the researchers need to seek audience with the Mozambique government to share with them the findings of the research which they can use as they conduct global negotiations, he further advised.

The study has shown that current negative impacts are already translating into societal and individual loss and damage. However, more research is needed to quantify the losses in economic terms to guide comprehensive national and international policy.

Currently, increasing accessibility to these data allows a cost-effective method for boosting knowledge about a country's biodiversity. for understudied countries where the lack of resources for conservation is more pronounced to resort to primary biodiversity data can be especially beneficial. Here, using a primary species occurrence dataset, we assessed and mapped Mozambique's knowledge gaps regarding terrestrial mammal species by identifying areas that are geographically distant and environmentally different from well-known sites. By comparing gaps from old and recent primary species occurrence data, we identified: (i) gaps of knowledge over time, (ii) the lesser-known taxa, and (iii) areas with potential for spatiotemporal studies. our results show that the inventory of Mozambique's mammal fauna is near-complete in less than 5% of the territory, with broad areas of the country poorly sampled or not sampled at all. the knowledge gap areas are mostly associated with two ecoregions. the provinces lacking documentation coincide with areas over-explored for natural resources, and many such sites may never be documented. it is our understanding that by prioritising the survey of the knowledge-gap areas will likely produce new records for the country and, continuing the study of the well-known regions will guarantee their potential use for spatiotemporal studies. the implemented approach to assess the knowledge gaps from primary species occurrence data proved to be a powerful strategy to generate information that is essential to species conservation and management plan. However, we are aware that the impact of digital and openly available data depends mostly on its completeness and accuracy, and thus we encourage action from the scientific community and government authorities to support and promote data mobilisation. Effective conservation planning relies on insightful knowledge and data acquisition about species occurrence and distribution 1. Primary species-occurrence data across dispersed data sources can be a cost-effective resource for boosting knowledge about a country's biodiversity 2.

“The drought experienced here in Mozambique will continue and it is very important to be prepared,” he says.

According to UN data, Southern Africa experienced its worst drought in 35 years in 2016, due to a cyclical combination of weather phenomena known as El Niño.

The lack of rain in southern Mozambique has depleted the reserves of seeds and other agricultural products that most of the population uses as food.

Two years later, the problem seems to have abated, but it remains nonetheless. The rainy season, which ended with the arrival of April, was abundant (and even destructive) in the north, but weak in the south.

Figures from United Nations agencies point to an estimated 24 percent of the population living in food insecurity, most in the drought-prone areas in the south and east. Almost seven million people do not know where their next meal is coming from.

Mozambique is one of the worst-affected parts of the planet.

Even the capital, Maputo, has become accustomed to living with restrictions on water supply, which only flows from taps every other day.

“Mozambique mainly – with South Africa – is one of the worst-affected parts of the planet,” Serrano says.

What was a rare cyclical phenomenon has become persistent, he says. “If you look at the trend over the last hundred years, how the climate is changing,” there are associated “impacts on many parts of the world,” he adds.

“Climate change trends are long-term. It’s not a matter of a year or two, but rather a longer term,” he says.

Farmers training through activities such as the ‘Escola na Machamba’ (Vegetable Garden School) is among the investments the FAO is making in Mozambique, to help the population to grow more drought-resistant products, with more efficient use of water.

The intervention also focuses on promoting other improvements in agricultural activity to address a range of challenges of which drought is just one.

For example, the government has announced that between 30 and 40 percent of the country’s agricultural crops were lost due to pests since April 2017. The executive has already classified the situation as worrying and is trying to mobilise resources to address the problem.

Olman Serrano, who arrived in Maputo at the end of March, is from Costa Rica and has been working in the FAO for 24 years.

In the last four years he has been a representative in Equatorial Guinea (the most recent member of the Community of Portuguese Speaking Countries), having previously worked in Ecuador, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Tanzania, Malawi and Bhutan.

Water supply and sanitation in Mozambique is characterized by low levels of access to an at least basic water source (estimated to be 47% in 2015), low levels of access to at least basic sanitation (estimated to be 24% in 2015) and mostly poor service quality. In 2007 the government has defined a strategy for water supply and sanitation in rural areas, where 62% of the population lives. In urban areas, water is supplied by informal small-scale providers and by formal providers.

Beginning in 1998, Mozambique has reformed the formal part of the urban water supply sector through the creation of an independent regulatory agency called CRA, an asset-holding company called FIPAG and a public-private partnership (PPP) with a company called Aguas de Moçambique. The PPP covered those areas of the capital and of four other cities that had access to formal water supply systems. However, the PPP ended when the management contracts for four cities expired in 2008 and when the foreign partner of the company that serves the capital under a lease contract withdrew in 2010, claiming heavy losses.

While urban water supply has received considerable policy attention, the government has no strategy for urban sanitation yet. External donors finance about 85% of all public investments in the sector. The main donors in the water sector are the World Bank, the African Development Bank, Canada, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland and the United States.

Access [ edit ]

Woman fetching water during the dry season from a polluted source in Machaze District of the Central Manica Province.

Only about 47% of the Mozambican population has access to an at least basic water source, and only 24% has access to at least basic sanitation.[1][4] Consequences on living conditions are multiple, ranging from poor health to lower productivity due to the time needed to fetch water.

Figures on access are controversial. For example, the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Program for Water Supply and Sanitation estimates access to an at least basic source of water supply at 79% in urban areas and 32% in rural areas as of 2015.[4] However, the Ministry of Public Works uses the water access figures of 38% in urban areas and 40% in rural areas. The numbers for rural access are derived from the number of boreholes and an estimated average number of households using a borehole.[5]

There are also conflicting figures about what are the target figures to meet the MDGs for water and sanitation by 2015. According to a World Bank document it means urban access to water increasing to 78% and rural access increasing to 56%.[5] However, according to a MDG status report it means increasing access to 70% in both urban and rural areas.[6]

Service quality [ edit ]

There are few published reliable data on water and sanitation service quality in Mozambique. Many water systems provide water intermittently. However, four cities – Beira, Pemba, Quelimane and Nampula – have achieved continuous or almost continuous water supply as a result of private sector participation, increasing the hours of water supply per day from 9 hours (Beira and Quelimane) and 17 hours (Nampula and Pemba) in 2002 to 22–24 hours in 2007. Water supply in Maputo remains intermittent, increasing only slightly from 12 to 14 hours.[2]

History [ edit ]

National Water Policy of 1995 and institutional reforms [ edit ]

In 1995, Mozambique approved a National Water Policy that emphasizes community participation and, for urban water supply, private sector participation. In 1998 the World Bank approved its First National Water Development Project in support of the National Water Policy. Other donors provided co-financing for the project.

In 1998 two key institutions were created to implement the National Water Policy: The regulatory agency CRA and the Asset Holding Company FIPAG. The government also approved a water tariff policy aiming at cost recovery.

Private sector participation (1999–2012) [ edit ]

In 1999 the government competitively awarded a hybrid lease/management contract for seven cities to an international consortium called Aguas de Moçambique (AdeM), which was led by the French firm SAUR (35%) and included Aguas de Portugal (32%). For Maputo and Matola the contract consisted of a 15-year lease and for the other cities of a 5-year management contract.[7] AdEM also included a 30%-shareholding by a Mozambican holding company called Mazi of Mozambique consisting of six local shareholders. AdeM's financial bid was substantially lower than that of the closest competitor. According to a World Bank study, it ultimately proved to be unrealistically low.[8]

By 2001 AdeM had encountered serious financial difficulties, exacerbated by the impact of the disastrous 2000 Mozambique flood. When an independent review denied tariff increases to compensate for the flood damages, SAUR withdrew from the contract in October 2001. In December it sold its shares for a nominal amount to Águas de Portugal.[8] Subsequently, FIPAG and AdeM renegotiated the contracts, obtaining higher fees and improvements in the specification of service obligations and procedures.[2]

In 1999 the World Bank approved the Second National Water Development Project[9] In 2004 the five-year management contract for the smaller cities was extended by three years. The contract was subsequently extended by another year and ended in March 2008, so that only Maputo remained under private management. The World Bank's 2006 completion report of the first project ""rated the outcome for the project satisfactory, its sustainability likely and its institutional development impact substantial"".[10]

In December 2010 the government, through FIPAG, bought the 73 percent of the shares in AdeM held by Águas de Portugal, thus effectively and unspectacularly ending the era of private sector participation in urban water supply in Mozambique four years before the end of the lease contract in 2014. Águas de Portugal said it had made losses of 10 million Euros. The sales price had been determined by the International Finance Corporation and was set at 2.6 million Euros.[11] In August 2011 AdeM changed its name to Águas da Região de Maputo (Waters of the Maputo Region), reflecting in its name the reduction of its service area that had occurred in 2008.[12]

In 2004, FIPAG entered into a three-year contract with the Dutch company Vitens under which the latter provided management support services and training in four small southern cities – Xai-Xai, Chokwe, Inhambane and Maxixe. Another contract between FIPAG and Vitens was signed in 2006 for services in five additional small cities in central Mozambique – Tete, Moatize, Chimoio, Manica and Gondola. At the time, these contracts were considered transitional arrangements to prepare the services for more conventional delegated management.[2]

While Vitens' obligations under the first contract were similar to those in AdeM's management contract, its services were provided free of charge and its staffing arrangements were quite different. While AdEM management changed constantly and its expatriate-only team was based in Maputo only, according to a World Bank study, Vitens used a staffing model with only the team leader residing in Mozambique, assisted by short-term experts from the Netherlands. The Dutch team developed a close working relationship with Mozambican team members, thus strengthening local capacity.[2]

National Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Program (2007 onwards) [ edit ]

Through the Decentralization Law of 1997, which created municipal governments with elected leaders, and the Law of Local State Organs of 2003 the 129 district and 11 provincial governments of Mozambique are supposed to gradually take over more responsibilities in various fields including water supply. Decisions about investments are expected to be taken at the local level. However, the district and provincial governments often still lack the financial and human resources to carry out their responsibilities. In 2007 a National Rural Water and Sanitation Strategic Plan has been adopted, which led to the decision to create Provincial Water and Sanitation Services (SPAS) in 2009 and the establishment of a common fund for rural water supply and sanitation (PRONASAR) in 2010.[13]

Canada, the Netherlands, UNICEF, Switzerland, the UK and the African Development Bank contributed to the Common Fund.[14] The 129 districts of Mozambique are the focal point for planning and implementing the program. In 2010/11 a baseline water supply and sanitation survey has been carried out covering 2,500 households in 75 districts.[15][16]

In mid-2011 the director and financial administrator of the central regional office of the Asset Holding Company (FIPAG), José Duarte and Henriques Leonardo, were fired because they were accused of having created a private water supply company, Recta, which competed with FIPAG to supply water to ships in Beira port. A year later they were arrested after the case against them had been compiled. The affair is said to have caused FIPAG losses of 37 million meticais (US$1.23 million).[17]

Responsibility for water supply and sanitation [ edit ]

For urban two public Asset Holding Companies – FIPAG in the 13 largest cities, AIAS in secondary towns – own the water and sewerage assets. Besides them, informal small-scale independent water providers own and operate local piped water systems in urban areas without a formal license. In Maputo alone, there are 450 such operators that provide water to 350,000 people.[18] In rural areas, community-based organizations are in charge of maintenance of water infrastructure.

Policy and Asset Holding Companies [ edit ]

The National Directorate of Water (DNA) in the Ministry of Public Works and Housing is in charge of policy for water supply. The Water Supply Investment and Asset Fund – the Fundo de Investimento e Patrimonio do Abastecimento de Agua (FIPAG) – is an asset holding company in Maputo and several other cities.[6] It operates under triannual performance contracts with the Ministry of Public Works and Housing. In 2009 a second asset holding company – the Administração de Infraestruturas de Abastecimento de Água e Saneamento (AIAS) – was created for urban sanitation and water supply in secondary towns.[19] The Ministry of Health is in charge of setting and monitoring compliance with drinking water standards.

Regulation [ edit ]

The urban water supply sector is regulated by the regulatory agency Conselho de Regulacao do Abastecimento de Agua (CRA). Its mission is “to ensure a balance between the quality of the service, the interests of consumers and the financial sustainability of the water supply systems.” It does so by approving tariffs, setting service quality targets, monitoring compliance with the targets, reviewing investment programs and hearing complaints by users and municipalities. CRA does not yet have the mandate to cover urban sanitation service or small-scale independent water providers.[20]

Service provision [ edit ]

FIPAG is the owner of water and sewerage assets in 13 cities. In the Maputo Region the company Águas da Região de Maputo (Waters of the Maputo Region) operates the public water and sewer system under contract with FIPAG. ARM is majority-owned by FIPAG (73%) with a minority owned by the private Mozambican holding company Mazi. In the remaining cities, public municipal water departments operate and maintain the systems. De facto, municipal governments play a very limited role in water supply and sanitation despite their legal responsibilities. Their revenue is so low that they depend on the central government for funding.[21]

Rural services [ edit ]

Rural water and sanitation services have been falling under the National Directorate of Water – Direcção Nacional das Águas (DNA) under the department Water and Sanitation (Departemento Água e Saneamento) until December 2015. Then DNA was split into two separate Directorates – and drinking water and sanitation came under Director Nacional Abastecimento de Agua e Saneamento (DNAAS).

The PRONASAR report of 2012 highlighted that capacity of district staff is still a blockage. In total 274 people are on water and sanitation positions in the 128 districts.

Financial aspects [ edit ]

Tariffs [ edit ]

No detailed and up-to-date data on water tariffs in Mozambique are available. Tariffs follow an increasing-block structure. In 2005 average water tariffs in Maputo were 12,500 Meticais (US$0.54/m3) and between 10,200 and 11,200 Meticais per cubic meter (0.44–0.49/m3) in Beira, Quelimane, Nampula and Pemba.[3]

CRA approved real average tariff increases of 5 to 10 percent per year in the service areas of the private company AdeM over the period 2002–07, applying a tariff indexation formula. However, after adjustment for inflation tariffs barely increased. Due to the contract structure, the limited inflation-adjusted increases benefited the public asset holding company FIPAG, not the private operator. FIPAG's financial performance improved steadily as a result of the tariff increases.[2] The water company for Maputo has to pay a regulatory fee to CRA, and all licensed water companies have to pay water abstraction charges to the central government for pumping water from rivers or the ground. These fees and charges are added to the water tariff.[3]

Cost recovery [ edit ]

The government aims to gradually achieve full cost recovery for water supply, as stated in its 1998 water tariff policy. According to the World Bank, the urban asset holding company FIPAG is ""achieving full cost recovery and can graduate from government subsidies"".[22] On the other hand, the Mozambique MDG status report for water and sanitation notes that the sector as a whole still strongly depends on donor financing.[6] In rural areas revenues are by far insufficient to recover operation and maintenance costs.[6]

Investment [ edit ]

There are no reliable data on actual investments in the sector. It has been estimated in 2006 that the water sector requires annual public investments of US$82 million to reach the MDGs, compared to US$67 million annually that have been ""planned"".[6] According to the World Bank, in 2007 Mozambique's delegated private sector management approach has attracted about US$350 million to urban water over the previous six years.[22]

Financing [ edit ]

About 85 percent of investments in water supply were financed by aid in 2006–08. External financing has increased by 150 percent as compared to 2003–05, from US$46 million to US$116 million. Funding channeled through the national budget has been disbursed at a rate of 82 percent, while donor-managed projects disbursed only at an average rate of 58 percent.[23]

Planning and Monitoring [ edit ]

A 2009 Water Sector Public Expenditure Review by the World Bank found that there are numerous planning documents, but still no comprehensive planning. Donors are not well coordinated and the Ministry of Finance changes budget allocations in mid-year. While there are many reports on outputs and on disbursements, the two are not linked to each other so that it is impossible to estimate value for money.[24]

Efficiency of utilities [ edit ]

Houses in the outskirts of Maputo

Because of the poor condition of the networks, illegal connections and vandalism of meters, unaccounted-for water (UfW) was over 50 percent in most areas in 2007. In Maputo, unaccounted-for water apparently increased substantially during the lease contract with AdeM from an estimated 38 percent in 2002 to 62 percent in 2005.[3]

Collection efficiency, the share of bills actually paid, reached only 64% in 2004, up from about 30 percent before the lease contract, but far short from the contractual target of 87 percent for 2004.[3] However, these figures are far from precise, and other estimates speak 60 percent UfW and 60 percent collection efficiency before in the late 1990s before the lease contract for Maputo.

According to a World Bank study, staff productivity in Maputo (5.4 employees per 1000 connections) compared favorably with large water companies in the Africa region. Staffing ratios were still high in the other areas, but were improving as the number of connections increased.[2] In 1998 the number of staff per 1000 connections ranged from 10 in Maputo to up to 34 in some towns.[25]

External cooperation [ edit ]

The main donors in the water and sanitation sector are the African Development Bank, Switzerland, the Netherlands, UNICEF and the United States. Switzerland and the United States are focused on the Northern Provinces. Other donors in the water and sanitation sector include Austria, Canada, the European Commission, France, Ireland, Italy, Japan and the UK. The World Bank and Sweden are active in water resources management. Overall, about 15 donors are engaged in water supply and sanitation in Mozambique. Donor coordination is most advanced in rural areas, where Canada, the Netherlands, UNICEF, Switzerland, the UK and the African Development Bank together with the government pooled their financial resources in a Common Fund.[14]

African Development Bank [ edit ]

The African Development Bank (AfDB) supported the water and sanitation sector with four investments projects since 1981. It provided US$19.6M of co-financing for the World Bank-led second national water supply project. In April 2009 it approved the Niassa Provincial Towns Water and Sanitation Project in Cuamba and Lichinga towns, supported by a US$27 million loan.[26]

In 2010 it approved a 28m Euro combined grant and loan to support rural water supply and sanitation in Nampula and Zambezia Province. Parts of the funds are channeled through the common fund established by the government for rural water supply and sanitation, while another part is channeled outside of the common fund.[14]

Canada [ edit ]

Since 2000 Canadian CIDA supports the Inhambane Rural Water Development Program (IRWDP).[27]

The Netherlands [ edit ]

The Netherlands has committed a total of 17 water projects for Mozambique in the period 2005–11. The largest commitment was 18.6m Euro for a Maputo water project in joint funding with the EIB, the EU water facility and the French Development Agency in 2007. The second-largest commitment was 15m Euro for a water project in the city of Chimoio in Manica Province in 2009. More than 8m Euro were approved in 2008 to support the activities of the public Dutch water company Vitens in four cities (see further above under history).[28] The Netherlands also provided US$10m of co-financing for the World Bank-led second national water supply project.

Switzerland [ edit ]

Since 1979, Switzerland is backing governmental efforts in the fields of rural water supply in the Northern provinces, training (training institutions, scholarships, human resource department) and institutional support to central and provincial authorities. The Swiss program was revised in 2003 to focus more on promoting, documenting and disseminating innovative experiences and bring them to the national debate in partnership with other donors such as the World Bank and the European Union. The main focus will remain the rural population of Northern Mozambique. Swiss aid is partially channeled through NGOs such as Helvetas in Cabo Delgado Province, CARE in Nampula and Cabo Delgado provinces, and WaterAid in Niassa and Zambezia provinces. The Swiss aid budget for water and in Mozambique is about US$3M per year.[29]

UNICEF [ edit ]

UNICEF carried out a 40 million Euro Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) program from 2007–2011 in the provinces Gaza, Zambezia, Manica, Sofala and Tete. The program had four components. The policy and planning component supported the establishment of strategic plans at the provincial, district and municipal level in four provinces as well as the creation of data banks for water and sanitation, as well as capacity building in seven (unnamed) ""model districts"".[30]

The rural component aimed to provide at least 500,000 new users in rural areas with access to ""safe drinking water facilities"" and ""440,000 new users with access to improved latrines"". The urban component was supposed to ""develop the capacity of local stakeholders for adequate planning and implementation of decentralised WASH interventions"", as well as ""stimulation of demand for improved WASH services"" and hygiene promotion, providing ""at least 100,000 new users in poor urban and peri-urban with access to safe drinking water facilities in six targeted municipalities"" and ""100,000 new users with access to improved latrines"".[30]

The school component provided ""technical and financial assistance for the provision of child-friendly water, sanitation (separate for girls and boys) and hand washing facilities in 220 schools.""[30] A 45 million Euro follow-up project continued to support activities in the provinces Gaza, Manica, Sofala and Zambézia, with new activities in the provinces Cabo Delgado and Nampula.[31]

The United States [ edit ]

In 2007 the Millennium Challenge Corporation approved a US$203.6 mn Water Supply and Sanitation Project for six cities, two mid-sized towns and 600 villages.[32] The project is part of a larger programme covering the three Northern Provinces Zambézia, Nampula and Cabo Delgado. The program also includes road construction, farmer income support and land tenure services.[33]

The World Bank [ edit ]

In 2012 the World Bank approved a US$50m loan to ""strengthen the management of national water resources and increase the yield from Corumana dam to augment water supply for the Greater Maputo Metropolitan Area.""[28]

The Water Services and Institutional Support Project, a US$30M project approved in 2007, aims to increase water service coverage in the cities of Beira, Nampula, Quelimane, and Pemba and to establish an institutional and regulatory framework for water supply in smaller cities and towns.[34] The World Bank was closely involved in the promotion of private sector participation in urban water supply through two projects. The first project (1998–2006) supported building capacity, rural water supply, water resources management, and the preparation of a new urban water supply strategy through a US$36m credit. This strategy, implemented during the second water project (2004–2009), supported large-scale civil works for urban water supply systems in five cities – Maputo (the capital), Beira, Quelimane, Nampula and Pemba through a US$75m credit.[22]

The Mozambique Water Private Sector Contracts project is an Output based aid project supported by a US$6m grant approved in 2007. It aims to provide subsidized water connections for domestic consumers in Maputo, Beira, Nampula, Quelimane, and Pemba. The project is implemented by FIPAG and expects to subsidize the construction of more than 30,000 shared yard taps which would impact approximately 468,000 people.[35]

353,https://www.afdb.org/en/news-and-events/mozambique-water-project-boosts-yields-farmers-grapple-climate-extremes-36679,"In Mozambique, water project boosts yields as farmers grapple with climate extremes","Felicidade Machava, 60, likes to recount the story about how, one year, she filled a small truck with maize from her harvest.

Machava, is a farmer in Guija district in Mozambique. The country has been experiencing weather volatility in the form of longer and more frequent cyclones and droughts. Extreme climate events affect the agriculture sector, a source of employment for 70% of Mozambicans, by hampering productivity, straining subsistence output, and reducing opportunities along the agricultural value chain.

With funding from the African Development Bank, Climate Investment Funds and the Mozambican government, the project provided irrigation kits, constructed boreholes, small dams and water troughs that increased access to water for people and cattle and also helped boost farmers’ yields to the benefit of nearly 60,000 people. The project covered five districts in the country’s drought-prone Gaza province.

Machava is a member of Green Revolution, a farmers’ association that participated in the Sustainable Land and Water Resources Management Project (SLWRMP). The 20 members of Green Revolution farmers’ association in Guija, 12 of whom are women, rotated 12 irrigation kits among themselves so that each day three farmers had the use of them on small plots.

The project also provided a pumping system for the collective’s farmers to use. It was expensive to run – fuel costs run as high as $15 a day – but members’ fees contributed to covering it. With advisory support from a government official in their district, the farmers generated a financial surplus by selling green beans, maize, pumpkin, kale, onion and green pepper in the local market.

According to Machava, “In 2017, I was able to focus strongly on the production of green beans, which allowed me to buy an additional plot of land for approximately $83 and start to build a new home – which I hope to complete with the earnings of the next agricultural season.”

For farmer Rute Bila, the project has allowed her to access a reliable source of water from a river near her farmland. Bila has increased production from her fields and is now able to pay school fees for her nephews. Speaking of her business plans, she says, “I bought a goat, which I paid approximately $38 for, and I hope to expand into a flock of goats that I can sell.”

She’s not the only one. “My goal is to someday supply to the big manufacturing companies in the area,” said Guezanes Maluleque, a 53-year-old farmer in the village of Mapai Rio. He heads up two households but finds it advantageous to pay four laborers to work some of his 30 hectares, freeing up members of his family to cultivate their own plots of land.

Under SLWRMP, Maluleque received 150 cashew and 60 mango trees and in his first crop produced 50 kilos that he was able to sell to a traveling salesman for $1 a kilo.

The project distributed a total of56 irrigation kits across the five participating districts, which directly benefitted 3,600 people, more than 80% of them women. The target beneficiaries of the irrigation kits were trained in how to use them properly.

With the nearest river at least 20 km away for many of the farmers, the project also built 21 small earth dams to water cattle and to meet villagers’ needs. Three more dams were built than had been originally planned for, more than doubling to almost 30,000 the number of people who gained improved access to water. More than 50,000 head of cattle are watered at these dams, over three times the number the dams were expected to serve.

According to analysis by the World Bank Development Impact Evaluation Research Group of the seven-year project, irrigation kits increased farmers’ productivity threefold. And the knock-on benefits extend beyond livelihoods. “I’ve had a change in nutrition as now I am able to produce vegetables such as lettuce and onions,” said Alberto Mutasse.

Lessons learned from the project mean it can be replicated and scaled up in other districts. Best practice from its implementation has already been incorporated into the Bank’s Drought Recovery & Agriculture Resilience Project . In addition, Mozambique government staffers have been trained in how to roll out and manage climate adaptation strategies.

Total funding for SLWRMP, which wrapped up in December 2019, was an estimated $21.5 million; $4.9 million was provided by the Bank Group’s African Development Fund. Climate Investment Funds extended $15.9 million in financing and the Government of Mozambique $0.5 million.","Machava is a member of Green Revolution, a farmers’ association that participated in the Sustainable Land and Water Resources Management Project (SLWRMP).

Southern Mozambique will face a below-average harvest for the third year in a row due to a prolonged drought, while other parts of the country suffer from severe rain and flooding, noted humanitarian surveillance network Fews.net [ Famine Early Warning Systems Network].

Southern Mozambique and parts of the southern provinces of Tete, Manica and Sofala “are facing a drought combined with abnormally high temperatures,” the latest report on food security in the country by the Famine Early Warning Systems Network, which brings together U.S. organisations, said.

Insufficient and erratic rainfall is leading to multiple planting attempts lost by families, with the majority of the 28 million Mozambicans living on subsistence agriculture.

“The latest crops planted are still in the germination stages and are unlikely to reach maturity, even with improved rainfall,” the network added.

Thus, production “is expected to be below average in southern areas for the third season in a row, with some areas facing total crop loss”.

There are opposing weather situations happening simultaneously in Mozambique, a country about two thousand kilometres long, from northeast to southwest.

The south faces a prolonged drought, but in some areas affected by 2019 cyclones in Sofala, Zambezia and parts of Manica, there are severe phenomena, including heavy rains and flooding, thunderstorms, hailstorms and strong winds.

“This can result in a greater unproductive agricultural phase until the post-flood crop can be harvested later than usual,” the document noted.

As of January 28, nearly 68,000 people have been affected by the storms associated with the rainy season, from October to April, with the death of 45 people and damage to infrastructure, including more than 3,000 homes, bridges, schools, health centres and electrical networks.

Areas affected by armed attacks in Cabo Delgado (north) and areas with low levels of assistance in Tete (centre) face a food crisis and are the most worrying in Mozambique, the report said.

Thanks to a climate-resilience project providing irrigation and drainage in her home province of Gaza, Matusse has been able to increase the area she cultivates from a quarter to three quarters of a hectare and has added kale, cabbage, carrots to her staple crop, maize.

In 2013, Gaza Province was devastated by heavy floods, with almost 200,000 people uprooted from their homes. Just three years later, Mozambique was struck by severe drought, affecting nearly half a million people and leaving 400,000 people in need of food assistance.

With the aim of bolstering the resilience of farming communities to these recurrent climate shocks, the African Development Bank-supported the Baixo Limpopo Irrigation and Climate Resilience Project (BLICRP) implemented in Xai-Xai District of Gaza Province.

The extra income Matusse has generated through the project has allowed her to save money through a savings and credit association, build her house, pay for school fees and purchase two goats with the aim of transitioning to cattle farming in the future.

Since BLICRP was started in 2013, she has noticed that many of her neighbours have returned home after migrating to the capital Maputo or even South Africa in search of work. This reverse migration was accelerated in the 2017/18 planting season, when more than 400 farmers received intensive training in new technologies for rice production.

Matusse’s ambition now is for her children to go to university, and to construct a house of bricks so she does not have to repair her reed house every year.

“The project gives an opportunity to the unemployed youth to make a living through farming. This project is our real dream,” she said.

The seven-year BLICRP project provided around 9,000 smallholder farmers in Xai-Xai with climate-resilient infrastructure, including two pumping stations to improve drainage and irrigation, and a 52 kilometre drainage network servicing a total area of 2,000 hectares. Nearly 48 km of rural roads were rehabilitated to a climate-resilient design.

The project also added value to agricultural production, mainly in rice and horticulture, with the construction of an agro-processing centre, CEPHOL in Xai-Xai city, which opened in June 2019 to purchase farmers’ produce and provide primary processing – washing, sizing and packaging – as well as cold storage and conservation to reduce post-harvest losses.

With agreements to supply the wholesale and retail markets in Maputo and sweet potatoes to the South African market, CEPHOL has allowed local farmers to reach buyers way beyond their usual markets.

Another beneficiary is 57-year-old farmer António Gaveta, who owns 10 hectares of land within the BLICRP scheme area. A surge in his agricultural productivity has allowed this proud father to invest $3,200 per year in the education of three of his six children.

His daughter Aurora is following in her father’s footsteps by studying agricultural economics, his son Antonio is on a healthcare management course and his younger daughter Mira is studying public administration.

According to Gaveta, “the BLIRCP project has allowed me to move forward with my own project, which is slightly different from that of the members of my community. In fact, I have what I like to call an education project”.

Within the project area, Agro Sumbunuca, a family-run company, opened to supply approximately 1,000 farmers with seeds, herbicides, equipment, animal feed and poultry chicks – the first private-sector operation under the BLIRCP scheme.

The major challenge now lies in attracting more private sector companies to engage with farmers and to cement this “farm-to-fork” value chain success story.

Total funding for BLIRCP was an estimated $44.08 million; $25.79 million was provided by a loan from the Bank Group’s African Development Fund. The Strategic Climate Fund extended $15.98 million in financing and the Government of Mozambique $2.31 million.","Just three years later, Mozambique was struck by severe drought, affecting nearly half a million people and leaving 400,000 people in need of food assistance.

The seeds are designed to help struggling families recover from the impact of the drought.

The seed distribution targeted farmers in the wake of a blistering El Niño induced-drought which caused failed planting seasons, forcing thousands of people, mostly dependent on subsistence farming, into food insecurity. The seeds are helping people like Torna Luís Piano, mother of Elísio, 7, and Festi, 4, and thousands of other farmers to start planting again. Torna saw her crops fail during the last two growing seasons due to lack of rains. Her means of livelihoods were destroyed and her children's life put on hold. “My son, Elisio, could not go to school due to hunger,” she recalls.

Last year, Torna started receiving food rations to help meet the family’s immediate food needs. To help Torna and other farmers provide for their families, World Vision provided drought resistant seeds directly benefitting 30,000 drought-affected people. The results are promising as the rains are falling and the plants are growing.

“You see the green out there?"" asks Torna. ""All this was dry during the drought,” she says, pointing to the field of sweet potatoes she grows together with 30 people in her group. “We were a little bit concerned when we were given this orange-fleshed variety of sweet potatoes to plant because we are not used to them. But, World Vision convinced us. When we harvested, we cooked [the potatoes] for our children, the rest we sold to get money for school fees and other needs,” Torna explains.

This year, Elisio, will attend school like the other children of his age in the community. “Things are getting better and there is no any excuse to stay at home,” Torna adds. Torna´s farmer's group is one of seven receiving technical assistance and seeds across the hardest hit districts of Changara, Cahora Bassa and Magoe in the Tete province.

“We are pleased with the progress made and the incredible support received from donors and the Government of Mozambique,” says World Vision’s Emergency Response Director, Ventura Mazula. “The programme was designed to address the people’s most critical needs. The impact has been positive. It is gratifying to be a part of a team of committed staff who work hard to make a difference in the lives of communities devastated by the drought,” he adds.

“The response did not resolve all problems and there are still challenges ahead of us. There is an ongoing need to continue working on disaster risk reduction to build resilience and adapt to climate changes. These challenges will require the continued support of key stakeholders,” Ventura shares.

An estimated 190,000 people have benefitted from World Vision’s drought response in Tete and Sofala provinces, through the provision of clean and safe water through rehabilitation and drilling of boreholes, child protection and nutrition interventions.","Last year, Torna started receiving food rations to help meet the family’s immediate food needs.

The government ordered the closure of all schools in late March, as a measure intended to restrict the spread of the Covid-19 respiratory disease. Reopening the schools will be gradual, starting with the 12th grade of secondary education on 27 July - but no school without a reliable supply of water will be allowed to reopen.

Muticumala told AIM that 11 of Zambezia's secondary schools cannot reopen because of poor sanitation and the obsolete state of the pumps on which their water supply systems depend.

He said there are 82 secondary schools in the province, of which 52 teach the second, pre-university cycle of secondary education (10th to 12th grade). But only 41 have guaranteed conditions for reopening. The other 11 that teach the second cycle need interventions in their plumbing in order to ensure that all pupils have sufficient water to wash their hands regularly - which is one of the basic measures used to keep Covid-19 at bay.

Five Zambezia teacher training colleges should also reopen on 27 July, and here Muticumala expected no problems. He regarded their level of readiness as ""very satisfactory"".

He guaranteed that efforts are under way to solve all the problems identified in the secondary schools that cannot open on 27 July.

The problems seem to be similar, or even worse, in the neighbouring province of Nampula where only 113 of the 154 secondary schools have adequate health conditions to resume classes on 27 July. The 41 secondary schools that cannot reopen cater for over 14,000 pupils.

Eight months after the cyclone, Oscar Eugenio is still on the precarious edge of disaster. “Some days we have food,” he says. “And some days we do not.”

His small farm in northern Mozambique was among the thousands destroyed by the two devastating cyclones that hammered the country within the space of a few weeks – an unprecedented phenomenon that has been blamed on climate change.

“We lost everything,” he says. “Our crops were destroyed. Our family grew hungry.”

Now he is among the estimated 45 million people in Southern Africa who will face severe food shortages over the next few months as a result of extreme weather: drought, flooding, fierce storms, late rainfall, rising food prices and other threats.

More than 11 million people are already suffering emergency levels of food shortages in nine Southern African countries, according to data from United Nations food agencies. Many regions of those countries are enduring their worst drought in 35 years, the organizations say.

The crisis in Southern Africa is just one of several emergencies across the continent. Countries such as Kenya, Ethiopia, Somalia and South Sudan have been hit by the double disaster of drought and flooding. In South Sudan, about 5.5 million people – nearly half of the population – are forecast to be facing hunger and the risk of famine in early 2020 as a result of flooding and drought, UN agencies say.

Southern Africa is going through some of the worst climate shocks on the continent. Severe drought, the second in three years, is hitting much of the region. The drought, combined with hyperinflation and economic mismanagement, has pushed Zimbabwe toward the risk of “man-made starvation,” a UN investigator has warned. Water levels in the Kariba Dam have sunk to such dangerously low levels that Zambia has been forced to impose power cuts. Cattle herds – along with elephants and other wild animals – have been dying in huge numbers in Namibia.

“This year’s drought is unprecedented, causing food shortages on a scale we have never seen here before,” said a statement by Michael Charles, head of the International Red Cross Federation in Southern Africa.

“We are seeing people going two to three days without food, entire herds of livestock wiped out by drought and small-scale farmers with no means to earn money to tide them over a lean season.”

As the drought expands, the link to climate change has become increasingly clear. Southern Africa’s temperatures are rising at twice the global average, the UN says, and the region includes many of the African countries that are considered to be the most vulnerable to climate change. Since 2012, the region has had only two favourable harvests. Rainfall is projected to be below-average over the next three months.

“With the region so prone to shocks and afflicted by high rates of chronic hunger, inequality and structural poverty, climate change is an existential emergency which must be tackled with utmost urgency,” said a statement by Robson Mutandi, the Southern Africa director for the International Fund for Agricultural Development, a UN agency.

In Mozambique, one of the countries at greatest risk from climate change, nearly two million people will need food assistance over the next several months, the government says.

Cabo Delgado, the northeastern province of Mozambique, was hit last April by Cyclone Kenneth – the strongest cyclone ever to hit the African continent, with wind gusts of up to 220 kilometres an hour.

But the province is also in the grip of a violent insurgency that has killed hundreds of people and forced about 65,000 people to flee their homes.

“People have the double impact of the armed violence and the cyclone,” said Patricia Danzi, the Africa regional director for the International Committee of the Red Cross. “They have to rebuild their lives twice.”

Mr. Eugenio is rebuilding the mud-walled buildings on his farm in Cabo Delgado, but the biggest blow was the loss of his cash crop, sesame, which he would normally sell to generate income for his family. Without any sesame crop, he survives by doing part-time labour on nearby farms, in exchange for a few kilograms of maize and beans.

But it’s not enough. On some days, he and his wife and four children have only cassava to eat, a low-protein food that has to be stretched out over the whole day.

He managed to get a small harvest from a few fields in October, but he can’t even estimate its size. “Every day we had to eat some of it,” he says.

“We haven’t recovered from the cyclone. We are still suffering today.”

Beira, Mozambique – The Mozambican health ministry has launched a vaccination campaign in cyclone-ravaged Beira city in a bid to contain an outbreak of cholera that has killed at least three people.

Kate Alberti, a cholera expert at the World Health Organization (WHO), said on Wednesday the six-day drive will inoculate some 900,000 people in the four districts affected by cyclone Idai.

The powerful storm made landfall in Mozambique on March 14 and triggered widespread flooding that submerged entire villages. At least 598 people were killed, more than 600,000 were displaced and officials have said they expect the death toll to rise.

As floodwaters began to recede, health officials warned of a “second disaster” from cholera and other diseases.

Transmitted by drinking contaminated water and food, cholera is endemic in Mozambique.

Alberti said that the cyclone had caused damage to infrastructure, while reducing access to water and sanitation.

“Now, we have vaccines to prevent cholera in the communities and stop this outbreak,” she said at the Ifapa camp in hard-hit Beira city

Children, who are at the highest risk of dying from cholera, will get priority, according to officials.

More than 1700 people have been infected since the outbreak was declared on March 27.

Health officials reported 200 new cases each day in Beira, a port city of half a million people.

The vaccination campaign will also cover the districts of Buzi, Nhamatanda and Dondo.

‘No option but to stay here’

Hundreds of people lined up on Wednesday to receive the oral vaccine doses at the Ifapa camp, where some 1,700 people displaced by the cyclone and flooding have taken shelter in 160 tarpaulin tents provided by aid agencies.

There were only 10 toilets for the camp’s residents, whose only source of clean water was a pump at the entrance to the camp.

Many were not happy about the poor quality of food and hygiene measures at Ifapa.

“Look at this cereal, is this nutritious?” asked Machel, holding up a small bowl of cornmeal. He only gave one name.

“We deserve better food. I know they are trying but the food quality needs to improve,” he said.

Teresa Jose, mother of three children, said: “The sanitary conditions of the camp are not very good for me and my children. The tents are not properly covered. It gets very hot during the day and cold at night.”

She added: “We have no option than to stay here for now but the conditions need to improve to ensure we don’t fall ill.”

Health workers at the camp trained residents on hygiene and safe preparation of food, said 23-year-old Maria Jorge.

The mother of two said she was concerned about the safety of her young children, aged one and three.

“I don’t want to go through the trauma of being infected with cholera, so I have to take extra care of myself and my children,” Jorge said.

The United Nations has called cyclone Idai the “worst weather-related catastrophes in the history of Africa”.

Officials in Mozambique are scrambling to contain a cholera outbreak in the north of the country after Cyclone Kenneth devastated the area last month.

Kenneth, the second cyclone to hit the country in five weeks, destroyed health clinics and contaminated the water supply.

The World Health Organization estimates there are ""nearly 190,000 people in need of health assistance or are at risk of diseases in Mozambique,"" U.N. spokeswoman Stephane Dujarric said.

Kenneth struck while Mozambique was still struggling to deal with the impact of Cyclone Idai, which hammered the country's central region just weeks earlier, flattening the port city of Beira and killing more than 1,000 people across Mozambique, Malawi and Zimbabwe.

According to the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, cholera cases in Cabo Delgado Province have risen almost five-fold to 64 since the outbreak was declared last week.

NEW YORK/BEIRA, 25 APRIL 2019 – More than 14,800 cases of malaria have been reported since 27 March in Mozambique’s Sofala Province, one of the areas hardest hit by Cyclone Idai, UNICEF said today – World Malaria Day. The UN children’s agency went on to warn of the risk malaria poses to the health of children, particularly to those who are malnourished or whose immune system is already compromised.



Among all communicable diseases globally, malaria is the third largest killer of children between the ages of one month and five years. Even before the cyclone, Mozambique was 1 of 15 countries that account for 80 per cent of malaria deaths around the world.



“We are deeply concerned about an increase in malaria transmission because receding muddy waters and standing pools left in the wake of Cyclone Idai are ideal breeding grounds for the mosquito population,” said Michel Le Pechoux, UNICEF Deputy Representative in Mozambique. “These conditions could lead to an explosion in the number of mosquitos carrying the disease which would put children at grave risk.”

UNICEF and its partners are ramping up efforts to prevent transmission of malaria. Approximately 1 million mosquito bed nets are needed for cyclone-affected areas, and UNICEF has so far procured 500,000 and distributed more than 116,000. Schools and health centres are also being treated with disinfectant and anti-mosquito spray as part of a campaign led by the Ministry of Health to complement the distribution of insecticide-treated bed nets.

The situation could be made even worse if Mozambique is significantly affected by Cyclone Kenneth – a new tropical cyclone which will likely make landfall today in the northern part of the country. UNICEF has already deployed emergency staff and prepositioned emergency supplies ahead of this next storm.



The needs in Mozambique remain massive, with 1 million children in need of assistance. UNICEF has launched an appeal for US$122 million to support its humanitarian response for children and families affected by the storm and its aftermath, in Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Malawi over the next nine months.

366,https://clubofmozambique.com/news/mozambique-future-mphanda-nkuwa-dam-estimated-at-us4-billion-165371/,Mozambique: Future Mphanda Nkuwa dam estimated at US$4 billion,"The Mphanda Nkuwa Hydroelectric project, which involves the construction of a new dam in the centre of the country, has been costed at about US$4 billion (€3.5 billion), the director of the Implementation Office told Lusa on Thursday.

“This amount is the result of studies carried out so far. Approximately 50% will go on the hydroelectric power station and the remainder on the Tete-Maputo power transmission line,” Carlos Yum said.

Originally planned several years ago, the Mphanda Nkuwa project was relaunched by the President Nyusi in 2018, and would be the largest dam in Mozambique after Cahora Bassa. It will be located 60 kilometres downstream from Cahora Bassa on the Zambezi River in the interior of Mozambique, about 1,500 kilometres northwest of Maputo, the Mozambican capital.

Carlos Yum calls the dam a “structuring project”, as the energy generated will also supply the regional market.

“The power line will work as a highway. In the future, other plants will be able to use the infrastructure, both internally and regionally,” adds Yum, who was sworn in as director of the Mphanda Nkuwa Hydroelectric Project Implementation Office on Wednesday.

Prior to his appointment, Carlos Yum was an administrator at Mozambique Electricity.

In September 2019, the Mozambican government selected a consortium of four companies to provide technical assistance in the preparation of the Mphanda Nkuwa project.

In an interview with Lusa, a year ago – after the project was relaunched – the deputy minister of Energy and Mineral Resources at the time, Augusto de Sousa, said that at least a decade would be needed to build the Mphanda Nkuwa dam and bring it into operation.","The Mphanda Nkuwa Hydroelectric project, which involves the construction of a new dam in the centre of the country, has been costed at about US$4 billion (€3.5 billion), the director of the Implementation Office told Lusa on Thursday.

367,https://clubofmozambique.com/news/watch-new-water-treatment-station-inaugurated-aim-148273/,Watch: New water treatment station inaugurated - AIM,"Mozambican President Filipe Nyusi on Thursday inaugurated the water treatment station at Corumana, in Moamba district, some 70 kilometres northwest of Maputo, which is a key part of the government’s plans to solve the water crisis that has been affecting Greater Maputo since 2014.

Maputo, the neighbouring city of Matola, and the districts of Boane and Marracuene have drawn their water supply from the pumping and treatment station on the Umbeluzi river. The flow of the Umbeluzi depends on the water stored in the reservoir behind the Pequenos Libombos dam, but over the past five years there have been times when the level of the water in the reservoir fell to below 20 per cent, forcing restrictions on the amount of water that could be pumped to greater Maputo.

The government has looked further north, to the Corumana dam, as an alternative source of water for Maputo. The new treatment station can handle 30,000 cubic metres of water a day, which will be pumped along a 95 kilometre mains pipeline to the water distribution centre in the Matola suburb of Machava.

In addition to boosting the Greater Maputo water supply, the new station will also treat the drinking water for the nearby communities of Corumana itself, Moamba town, Sabie, Pesse and Tenga.

Although inaugurated on Thursday, the treatment station will only start operating on 20 December, after thorough cleaning of the piping.

At the ceremony, Nyusi declared that the challenge of water supply and sanitation is one of the priorities of his governance, since it is intrinsically linked to the development of human capital and the welfare of the population.

In recent weeks, Nyusi has visited Cabo Delgado and Nampula in the north and the central provinces of Zambezia, Manica and Sofala, inaugurating new water systems in districts and municipalities. Now he intended to continue the same work in the rest of the provinces – Gaza and Inhambane in the south, Tete in the west and Niassa in the far north.

He promised that “we will only rest when the last Mozambican citizen has water”.","Mozambican President Filipe Nyusi on Thursday inaugurated the water treatment station at Corumana, in Moamba district, some 70 kilometres northwest of Maputo, which is a key part of the government’s plans to solve the water crisis that has been affecting Greater Maputo since 2014.

The year is winding down, and it’s time for Wall Street’s analysts to start flagging their top picks for the coming year. It’s a time-honored tradition, in most walks of life, to take a sometimes tongue-in-cheek look at what lies ahead, and to start giving advice on the say-so of a metaphorical crystal ball.Analysts have been analyzing each stock carefully, looking at its past and current performance, its trends on a variety of time frames, management’s plans – the analysts take everything into account. Their recommendations provide valuable direction for building a resilient portfolio in the new year.As normal, TipRanks has collected and collated the data on the top picks, and made it available for investors’ use. The stock choices, and their data, make for some interesting choices. Let's take a closer look. UTZ Brands (UTZ)UTZ Brands is a familiar label in the eastern US. The company is known for its range of snack foods, of the salty variety rather than sweet. The company’s line of foods, including pretzels, potato chips, snack mixes, and popcorn, are frequent choices in vending machines. In August, UTZ (then known as Utz Quality Foods) has completed a business combination agreement with Collier Creek, a special purpose acquisition company. The combination brought the venerable snack company into the public trading domain. More recently, UTZ posted strong Q3 results and reported that it has entered an agreement to buy competing snack company Truco. The quarterly results were released first, on November 5, showing $248 million in net sales, a year-over-year gain of 24%, along with a 23% yoy gain in gross profit. One week later, UTZ and Truco announced a $480 million acquisition agreement, which will bring the ‘On the Border’ brand of tortilla chips and salsas into UTZ product line.Covering this stock for Oppenheimer is 5-star analyst Rupesh Parikh, who sees a clear path forward for the company. “[Following] the company's announcement on 11/12 to acquire Truco Enterprises, [we] overall look very favorably upon the deal economics, synergy opportunity, leverage to the attractive tortilla category including ancillary products (salsa and queso), and compelling growth prospects for the brand,"" Parikh opined. ""We believe the company is well positioned to drive at least 3-4% organic sales growth and 6-8% EBITDA growth with upside optionality from strategic acquisitions,"" the analyst concluded. To this end, UTZ remains Parikh's top small-cap food pick. The analyst rates the stock an Outperform (i.e. Buy) along with a $24 price target. This figure implies a 28% upside from current levels. (To watch Parikh’s track record, click here)Overall, Wall Street loves this stock, earning a stellar analyst consensus rating -- Strong Buy. Out of 7 analysts tracked by TipRanks in the last 3 months, 6 are bullish on UTZ, while only one remains sidelined. With a return potential of ~16%, the stock's consensus target price stands at $21.71. (See UTZ stock analysis on TipRanks)RingCentral, Inc. (RNG)From salty snacks we move on to telecom tech. RingCentral is a cloud-based business communications company. The company’s products are software platform packages that combine telephone and computer systems. The flagship product platform, RingCentral Office, allows compatibility of the communications system with other popular business apps including DropBox, Google Docs, Outlook, and Salesforce. RNG also offers unique features necessary for communications systems: call forwarding, phone extensions, vid calling, and screen sharing.Much of the modern business world is about problem solving, and RingCentral does just that for its customers – and the results are clear in the revenues and stock performance. The top line number has been increasing through 2020, with the Q3 revenues coming in at $303 million for a 9.3% sequential gain. The shares recovered easily from the mid-winter COVID swoon, and the stock is trading up 76% so far this year.On the negative side, RingCentral operates at a net loss, and that net loss has been deepening even as revenues rose and the stock appreciated. The Q3 EPS loss came in at 24 cents.James Fish, 5-star analyst with Piper Sandler, wrote the review on RNG, and he is upbeat about the company’s future. “RingCentral is winning new customers and expanding with existing given its ability to converge across the communication software stack, including with contact center… we continue to recommend RingCentral as one of our 'core 4' in our coverage and a name to own for the next few years,” Fish commented. As a result, Fish reiterates RNG as his Top Pick. The analyst rates the stock an Overweight (i.e. Buy) alongside a $362 price target. At current levels, that indicates a possible 21% upside for the coming year. (To watch Fish’s track record, click here)Overall, RingCentral has 10 recent reviews, including 9 Buys and 1 Hold, making the analyst consensus view a Strong Buy. The average price target is $337.22, which suggests a 13% upside from the current trading price of $297.79. (See RNG stock analysis on TipRanks)DraftKings, Inc. (DKNG)The world of fantasy sports helps bring fans into the games, and now that the pro leagues have resumed play – albeit for abbreviated seasons, in deference to the coronavirus – DraftKings, which take fantasy leagues online, has been making gains. In addition to fantasy league creation, DraftKings offers sports betting, and the company’s online model has fit in well with the social distance restrictions put in place to combat the ongoing virus health crisis.In the third quarter, whose results were reported earlier this month, DraftKings had plenty of good news. Revenue, at $133 million, beat the forecast by $1 million, and the net loss per share was not as deep as analysts had feared. The company reported a key metric – monthly unique players – surpassing 1 million, an important milestone. Looking ahead, DraftKings revised its fiscal 2020 guidance upward, by 5.7% at the midpoint of the range, to $540 million to $560 million. The midpoint for 2021 revenue expectations is even more bullish, at $800 million.As noted, these gains come as the major sports leagues have returned to play. But that is not the only key here. DraftKings operates in 19 states plus DC – the jurisdictions which permit legal online sports betting. But an additional 8 states are in various stages of legalizing DraftKings’ niche, and the company looks forward to expanding its operations.Summing up the prospects for DraftKings, Rosenblatt analyst Bernie McTernan writes, “[DKNG] remains a top pick in our Consumer Tech coverage. 3Q results will continue the positive revenue estimate revisions given the better than expected guide for '20E and '21E. We are at the high end of the '21E range which we believe is achievable given our expectation for at least MI and VA coming online.""The analyst added, ""New state launches will pressure near-term adj. EBITDA but encouragingly the company indicates NJ, their most mature market, is in a similar spot where they had previously hoped it would be for its ramp in profitability.”McTernan rates DKNG a Buy, and his $65 price target implies a robust 41% one-year upside. (To watch McTernan’s track record, click here)All in all, there 19 reviews on record for DraftKings, including 13 Buys and 6 Holds, giving the stock a Moderate Buy rating from the analyst consensus. The shares are currently priced at $46.24 and have an average price target of $59, making the upside potential for the year ahead 38%.

Elias Paulo, cited by pan-African news agency APA, said the hydroelectric plant would take three years to build, and that the contractor was a consortium led by Brazilian group Andrade Gutierrez.

The cost of construction includes an amount of US$48 million spent on the relocation of about 1,600 people currently residing in the administrative posts of Sabie and Ressano Garcia, on the border with South Africa.

The foundation stone for construction of the Moamba Major dam on the Incomati River and related works was laid in November 2014.

The project will have capacity to store 760 million cubic metres of water, to be partially used for irrigation and production of 15 megawatts of power to add to the national power grid.

JOHANNESBURG -- A year after hundreds of people were killed by one of the southern hemisphere's worst cyclones, Mozambique's port city of Beira is rebounding, but more than a million people need food aid there and in the surrounding countryside.

“A year ago much of Beira was flooded by Cyclone Idai. Buildings were inundated, homes collapsed or were washed away,” said Daniel Timme of UNICEF, who was in the southern African city at the time. “People were desperately seeking family members and hunting for safe shelter and food.”

Back in Beira now, he marveled at the progress made in the city, Mozambique's fourth largest, as residents repaired buildings and roads have been rebuilt. Seasonal rains have returned, but flood canals are channeling the waters away and the city center is bustling.

“There is a buzz of activity in Beira's port and marketplaces now,” Timme said in a phone interview. “There's a great spirit of resilience here, although significant problems remain.”

Poverty and hunger are at high levels in Mozambique, one of the world's poorest countries.

“Under the surface, and on the fringes of the city, there are widespread shortages of food. We are finding that the levels of severe acute malnutrition are still high, especially among children,” Timme said.

Low-lying Mozambique, with a population of 30 million and a thousand-mile coastline on the Indian Ocean, is especially prone to climate change disasters, he said.

“The country is experiencing more extreme weather events, such as two major cyclones last year in central and northern Mozambique, while the country's south had a drought,” Timme said. Cyclone Kenneth roared in just six weeks after Idai, surprising a region of northern Mozambique rarely struck by cyclones.

“The food situation is bad. This year's harvest is expected to be poor. Already we see cases of severe malnutrition and we are distributing nutrition supplements, such as peanut butter paste,"" Timme said.

Now another health challenge looms large: the new coronavirus.

So far Mozambique has not recorded a case of COVID-19 but the disease is spreading across Africa. Neighboring South Africa on Sunday declared a national disaster after dozens of confirmed cases.

Mozambican health officials are increasing surveillance and working to improve hospitals.

But the high levels of malnutrition make many Mozambicans especially vulnerable. An estimated 1.6 million people don’t have enough to eat, according to UNICEF. More than 3,000 children under 5 have been diagnosed with life-threatening severe acute malnutrition in Beira and the surrounding plains of central Mozambique, Timme said.

The extreme weather disasters have left Mozambique, as well as neighboring Zimbabwe and Malawi, without adequate housing for thousands of families, according to Amnesty International. It called on the international community and the Mozambican government to ""step up reconstruction ... in a way that truly delivers human rights.”

“One year after the cyclone hit Beira, the reconstruction is taking place, but it's growing very slowly and people are rebuilding, they've put a tin roof on their home and they are trying to replant,"" said Deborah Nguyen of the World Food Program. Heavy rains this year have reduced crops and continued food aid is desperately needed, she said.

Mozambique has one of the highest rates of chronic malnutrition in the world, affecting 43% of children under 5, according to WFP.

“Mozambique is one of the countries that is the most severely affected by climate change,"" Nguyen said. ""Because of Mozambique's location and because it's already one of the poorest countries in Africa, we can see that climate change is impacting very badly the poorest communities and it will keep happening.”","Cyclone Kenneth roared in just six weeks after Idai, surprising a region of northern Mozambique rarely struck by cyclones.

373,https://phys.org/news/2013-02-mozambique-due-early.html,Mozambique saved from floods due to early warning,"An aerial photo shows the devastated southern Mozambican town of Chokwe on January 25, 2013. Engulfed by a raging torrent of water last week, Chokwe was all but destroyed for the second time in 13 years, but it emerged with a hugely lower death toll thanks to a decade-long effort.

Engulfed by a raging torrent of water last week, the town of Chokwe in southern Mozambique was all but destroyed for the second time in 13 years, but it emerged with a hugely lower death toll.

As in 2000 when floods of biblical proportions claimed 800 lives, an underdeveloped network of dams and dykes allowed the swollen Limpopo River to burst its banks, submerging most of the province of Gaza, where Chokwe is located, under metres (feet) of water.

But thanks to a decade-long effort to lessen the impact of natural disasters in Mozambique, most people escaped this time.

""Better climate science, more government commitment to use early warning information, good collaboration with local radio stations, word of mouth of Red Cross volunteers—all of these combined resulted in people moving before their lives were in danger,"" said Alexander Matheou, the International Red Cross's regional representative for East Africa.

Floods since early January have claimed 68 lives and displaced some 250,000 people countrywide.

Although the latest floods were not as severe in size or duration as the 2000 disaster, experts believe the impact could have been much worse.

""In 2000, there was no early warning to the population, so there were a lot more people who suffered and died,"" said UN World Food Program spokeswoman Lola Castro.

Immediately following the 2000 flood, donors poured $480 million into Mozambique to prevent another crisis of similar magnitude.

This allowed the government to create a national strategy to deal with disasters.

""It focused on the question of creating resilience amongst people and communities,"" said Rita Almeida, the National Disaster Management Institute spokeswoman.

Residents flee to the roof of a house in Chokwe district, to escape the floods, on January 25, 2013. Engulfed by a raging torrent of water last week, Chokwe was all but destroyed for the second time in 13 years, but it emerged with a hugely lower death toll thanks to a decade-long effort.

Nearly 40,000 people were resettled in less flood-prone areas. Investments in water management infrastructure and meteorological agencies were prioritised, at least on paper.

But the most successful project was the early warning system the government and NGOs introduced.

Mozambique Red Cross Society, the initiative's primary driver, funded a five-year disaster preparedness programme in 18 communities styled on schemes in the Philippines and Latin America.

With many rural dwellers lacking basic services like electricity—let alone telephones or television—planners took a community-based approach to design the system.

Local disaster committee members were trained in life-saving cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and equipped with emergency kits such as whistles, megaphones and life-jackets to help boost disaster response. Radios were distributed, enabling them to receive cyclone or flood warnings from the authorities and then pass on these messages by word of mouth.

The strategy ensures that each community has the basic ability to respond to a disaster, making them less reliant on a centralised response.

A resident of flood-hit Chokwe in southern Mozambique drinks drain water, on January 27, 2013. Engulfed by a raging torrent of water last week, Chokwe was all but destroyed for the second time in 13 years, but it emerged with a hugely lower death toll thanks to a decade-long effort.

Geography still leaves Mozambique vulnerable, however, whatever disaster reduction measures are in place.

Thirteen rivers with sources in neighbouring countries empty into the Indian Ocean after traversing Mozambique, which must rely on South Africa and Swaziland to keep downstream areas in mind when managing their dams.

""We have had situations where the South Africans did not warn us in time they were going to do discharges, with an interval of only two days,"" Suzana Laforte, head of Mozambique's water board, told the independent local paper Savanna.

Meanwhile, because of a lack of funds and expertise, the Maputo government is struggling to build and maintain its own infrastructure, which is paramount to preventing future floods.

Between 2009 and 2011 the resource-rich but impoverished nation channelled just $275 million toward efforts to reduce disaster risk, while international donors gave an additional $317 million.

Two new dams in critical areas on the Incomati and Limpopo rivers would cost $1.1 billion (805 million euros). An additional $200 million is needed for upgrades to urban drainage systems, according to Laforte.

""A lot has been done, but it's not sufficient,"" Castro said. ""There is a need for a huge amount of effort to build dykes, dams and roads.""

A UN report last week found that a damaged dyke that is in need of $27 million in repairs was ""one of the main issues that prompted the worsening"" of the floods in Chokwe.

Aid groups' ability to respond quickly to emergencies also remains an issue.

Tents, water and food have been provided to victims of last week's deluge, but more shelter and sanitation is needed.

""The lesson from this flood in Mozambique is that early warning is not enough,"" Matheou said. ""More pre-positioning of stocks and shelter planning was needed. That should be introduced before this is referred to as a model for replication.""

""In 2000, there was no early warning to the population, so there were a lot more people who suffered and died,"" said UN World Food Program spokeswoman Lola Castro.
Immediately following the 2000 flood, donors poured $480 million into Mozambique to prevent another crisis of similar magnitude.
But the most successful project was the early warning system the government and NGOs introduced.

374,https://www.euronews.com/2019/07/15/safe-cheap-and-sustainable-clean-water-technology-for-africa,"Safe, cheap and sustainable: Clean water technology for Africa","In this episode of Futuris, we meet the African and European scientists working together to find ways to disinfect water for domestic use in remote, isolated places in Africa, using sustainable and affordable technology. The researchers say one solution could lie in a small pilot water treatment plant currently being installed in southern Mozambique.

Mozambique is one of 16 sub-Saharan countries belonging to the Southern Africa Development Community.

Around 40% of the community's population has no access to safe water - that's around 130 million people.

The small town of Ressano Garcia, near the border with South Africa, illustrates the gravity and urgency of the situation.

""Right now, 14,000 people live in this town, Ressano Garcia,"" explains Silvestre Mario Trigo, technical manager at the Ressano Garcia water treatment plant. ""Not all of them have access to drinking water. So they turn to the river. But the water in this river is not treated. So when it reaches the households, it causes diarrhoea and other water-borne diseases"".

Contaminated water can also spread diseases like cholera, dysentery, typhoid or polio, even though in Ressano Garcia diarrhoea is the most common.

The local health centre takes care of some 500 patients every day. Around 10 per cent of them suffers from diarrhoea.

Abdul Rafael Sega is the director of the town's medical centre:

""One of the reasons for most cases of diarrhoea and diarrhoea-related diseases is the quality of water. It is very, very clear that the better water people have access to, the greater the improvement in the health of the entire population would be"".

Water cleaning technology

Providing safer water is the aim of this pilot unit being installed on the premises of the town's decaying water treatment plant.

The prototype was designed to degrade harmful pollutants such as pesticides and inactivate microbes and pathogens.

It uses a technology called ""electro-chemical oxidation"" that produces ozone in the polluted water. The ozone acts as a cleaning agent.

Amiro Abdula Martins is a civil engineer with Salomon LDA. He explains how the pilot system works:

""The station is able to treat the water over very different processes; coagulation, decantation [the splitting of liquids] and different phases of filtration. The system creates ozone in the water. This ozone is a characteristic of the high quality of the water; it effectively cleans the water. Our studies have shown that this system is able to clean between 80 and 90 per cent of all dirt present in the water"".

In South Africa, researchers had previously installed a bigger pilot plant 40 km south of Johannesburg using similar technology. The plant filters and cleans water from a nearby polluted river and an adjacent treatment plant.

Both that plant and Mozambique's small disinfection unit are part of a European Union research project aimed at providing safer water to rural and peri-urban African populations in efficient and affordable ways.

The South African plant has a maximum capacity of 1,300 litres of water per hour, says Zakitni Ngrobo, a water scientist at Tshwane University of Technology:

""In total, we try to clean at least 10,000 litres of water a day -- water that's drinkable, not harmful to human health and that can be used for both domestic purposes and for irrigation"".

The disinfection system is based on a special type of metal electrode.

Once filtered, the polluted water comes into contact with these electrodes. The electrodes then create the ozone that inactivates the germs.

Mbali Ntuli is also a water scientist at the Tshwane University of Technolgy. She explains the process:

""From the oxygen [in the water], we are going to add another molecule of oxygen, so we obtain O3. This is the ozone, which is being produced from just the water and the electricity. After that, it reacts with the water to kill the microorganisms, the pathogens, thus making the water much cleaner"".

Researchers want each station to be autonomous and built with as many African-made and green materials as possible.

Mark David Woods, a mechanical engineer with Virtual Consulting Engineers, says that decision was vital to the sustainability of the project:

""We said we were not going to use any chemicals for the disinfection process. The reason for that being is that it is difficult [to get them], especially if you want to go into rural communities, where the access to chemicals is very limited"".

Horizon 2020

This research effort is developed as part of the Horizon 2020 Programme.

The programme's international cooperation strategy aims to tackle global environmental and societal challenges using a partnership approach between European and local researchers.

European researchers have been working on how to prepare the water for treatment in a way that will maximise the effectiveness of the disinfection process.

The quality of the water in both South Africa and Mozambique turned out to be much worse that scientists had expected, especially due the massive presence of faecal compounds. So researchers had to develop a system designed to guarantee an efficient pre-treatment of that water to facilitate its later disinfection. That technology was developed in central Spain.

Chemical engineers at the University of Castilla-la Mancha soon understood that polluted water had to be extensively cleansed of organic compounds before any electrochemical process could be efficiently applied.

Cristina Sáez Jiménez is one of the engineers working on this project:

""From a technical view, pre-treatment technologies are physical-chemical processes. The aim is to separate the organic material suspended in the water before the water can be disinfected inside a reactor, where the water can get dirty again, eventually creating serious operational problems to the whole disinfection process"".

Researchers designed different kinds of pre-treatment systems before finding the right solution for the particular water quality and socio-economic conditions in both Mozambique and South Africa.

Then, the final system was scaled up, explains Javier Llanos López, another chemical engineer at the university:

""The coagulant that we are using is a kind of iron salt. So we add this iron salt to the water, that as you see here, becomes brown. The process turns the organic compounds into much bigger chunks that up here, in a decanter, we can separate much more easily"".

It was also important to find a low-cost way of treating the water before disinfection, says Castilla-la Mancha chemical engineer Manuel Andrés Rodrigo Rodrigo:

""If you try to disinfect water which is heavily polluted with faecal compounds, the electrochemical process would be very, very expensive. That´s why we decided to include some pre-treatment of the water that could keep the disinfection costs down. And that's not all: along with an inexpensive process, we also tried to use materials that were really low-cost"".

Diamond-based film

It was at a research centre in Germany where the disinfection technology was developed, with the helping hand of an unexpected material; diamond-based film.

Electrodes used to clean the water are built from a metal called niobium. The metal is coated with diamond-based film. Another chemical element, boron, provides the conductivity necessary for the whole technology to work. It's a lengthy, complex chemical process that requires the use of furnaces at a temperature of 2500ºC.

""With these electronic microscopes we can control the surface of a diamond electrode,"" says chemical engineer Sven Pleger, of the Fraunhofer Institute for Surface Engineering and Thin Films. ""These diamonds are 4 microns long, which is the right size for the application we are looking for. The electronic microscope also helps us to see the rugosity of the layer, and to check if the expected crystals have occurred during the process. And we can also check if there are any gaps in the surface and if the adhesion [to the metal surface] is sufficient or not"".

The resulting electrodes are then activated by electricity to start disinfecting the water.

The whole process is designed to be as energy-efficient as possible, as physicist Lothar Schäfer, also of the Fraunhofer Institute, explains:

""The diamond electrodes can create ozone with a very high electrical tension and with 100% efficiency in the use of electricity. We directly create ozone and not oxygen. It would be a waste of energy to create oxygen, as it would only float away without helping the cleaning process"".

Back in Mozambique, the small town of Ressano Garcia needs some 1,600 cubic metres of water per day to cover the basic needs of its growing population.

Researchers say they designed the small pilot unit to help meet that demand and set an example for other remote and isolated small towns and villages in Africa.

The main advantage of the small units is their flexibility and mobility.

""Even in remote, isolated places, the units can be easily installed,"" says civil engineer Nelson Pedro Matshinhe, from Salomon LDA. ""Our main aim is to obtain water that, once consumed by the population, does not create any public health problems. Our final objective is to improve the health of the people"".

To this end, the government will spend more than three billion meticais (about 43.2 million US dollars, at current exchange rates) to drill boreholes and build water supply systems, particularly in the rural areas, where there are serious shortages of clean water.

Machatine was speaking in Cabo Delgado where he inaugurated new water systems in Balama and Namuno districts which will benefit about 8,000 people.

Under the government’s present plans, he said, it will invest in the rural water sector “so that coverage rises from 40 to 43 per cent of the population by the end of this year. That, is we will increase the number of people benefitting from clean water from the current figure of more than 700,000 to about 800,000”.

But that is just for 2020. “If there are no constraints, then by the end of the current government’s term of office (2020-2024) about 70 per cent of the population will have access to water”, the Minister pledged.

The Balama water supply system will benefit about 5,000 inhabitants of the district capital, Balama town, but it is designed to expand to meet the needs of 28,000 people.

A second system, in the Machoca administrative post, in Namuno district, can eventually supply 9,000 people, but in the initial phase, water from this system will reach 3,000, said Machatine.

Taken together, the two systems cost over 100 million meticais, financed by the Mozambican government and by the Islamic Development Bank.

Currently, only about 40 per cent of the population of Cabo Delgado have access to clean drinking water. Most of the people living in the province rely on unsafe sources such as rivers, and traditional wells.","To this end, the government will spend more than three billion meticais (about 43.2 million US dollars, at current exchange rates) to drill boreholes and build water supply systems, particularly in the rural areas, where there are serious shortages of clean water.

The funds will primarily be utilized in support of water related emergency recovery efforts from damages caused by cyclones Idai and Kenneth in the cities of Beira, Dondo, Tete, Moatize, Nampula, Quelimane, Mocuba and Nacala. These investments will potentially benefit an additional 130,000 people from the original beneficiaries under the Water Services and Institutional Support Project II.

“The damages caused by recent cyclone Idai have placed tremendous pressure on the existing water supply services, leaving thousands of households without adequate water supply, with adverse impacts on public health,” noted Mark Lundell, World Bank Country Director for Mozambique.

The project will fund water production and distribution infrastructure in the cyclone affected cities, including expansion and refurbishment of wellfields, intake, and water treatment facilities, network rehabilitation and expansion, as well as leakages control systems to optimize the water supply service provision. These investments will enable the government to provide services to large numbers of people in low-income brackets of the population in the largest urban areas by reconstructing part of the damaged water supply infrastructures by the cyclone Idai and Kenneth. These activities will increase water supply and reliability, as well as the country’s resilience to droughts and other extreme weather events.

“These cities have been badly affected by heavy rains and floods during cyclone Idai, damaging the existing wellfields and parts of the network,” noted Lizmara Kirchner, Senior Water Supply and Sanitation Specialist and the Bank’s Task Team Leader for the project. “The project will rehabilitate critical infrastructure damaged by cyclone Idai and restore the basic water supply services in the affected areas.”

The additional financing will also help leverage additional resources to finance the planned water supply investments in Nacala. This financing will cover 50 percent of project investment costs, with the other 50 percent to be financed by the Government of Netherlands under its DRIVE Program.

The project is part of the World Bank’s broader regional post cyclone recovery package which comprises a set of operations totaling some $700 million in IDA resources – including up to $545 million from the IDA CRW – to support cyclone response in Malawi, Mozambique and Zimbabwe.

This expansion is planned to bring clean water to a further 100,000 people by the end of 2010. It will cost 45 million US dollars, financed by the World Bank. It is part of the WASIS II project, budgeted at 165 million dollars, intended to expand water supply in Beira, Nacala, Tete and Moatize.

""The project will result in 20,000 new domestic connections which will benefit about 106,000 consumers in Tete and Moatize"", declared Nyusi at the launch ceremony.

He said the project includes drilling 27 boreholes, building a mains pipeline from Tete to Moatize, and building a second pipeline from boreholes in the Revobue valley to Tete city.

The previous investments in water supply were in 1995 in Tete and 2016 in Moatize. Population growth, and the expansion of economic infrastructures, has put pressure on water supply since 1995, such that the demand for water is outstripping the supply capacity.

The current system provides 44,000 cubic metres of water a day. The new project will add a further 14,000 cubic metres a day.

Nyusi said that this project, alongside the PRAVIDA (Water for Life) programme launched last year, mean that the government is complying in full with the drinking water targets laid down in its five year programme for 2015-2019.

""As you can note, through concrete actions we are implementing our Five Year Programme"", the President added. ""We intend to build a healthy Mozambique, through the expansion and improvement of the distribution of drinking water"".

Nyusi also addressed rallies in Tsangano and Zumbo districts, where he stressed that unity among Mozambicans is the determinant factor for the country to overcome the enemies of peace and development. He urged all Mozambicans to unite in the struggle against terrorist groups who are destabilising some areas in the northern province of Cabo Delgado.

""My great appeal is for unity"", he declared. ""We Mozambicans should not be distracted because there are those who do not like the growth and development of Mozambique. There are others who are envious. There are those who are greedy - they want everything for themselves. They may be Mozambicans or outsiders"".

Nyusi said that, in his meetings with the public, he has received messages of encouragement to continue his efforts to achieve a definitive peace with the former rebel movement Renamo. He declared that the demilitarisation or Renamo, and the demobilisation and disarming of its militia should be completed in August.

Stanford researchers working in Mozambique point the way for an informal water practice to help solve one of the world's most pressing health and welfare issues.

Valentina Zuin In sub-Saharan Africa, about one in five people purchase water from neighbors connected to public or private utility lines.

In sub-Saharan Africa, more than 60 percent of city dwellers live in slums, and population pressures have led to unplanned development lacking basic infrastructure, such as water lines.

Only a third of urban dwellers have access to a piped water connection in their homes. Other sources, such as public standpipes, are often plagued by poor maintenance, heavy use and high cost due to the need for attendants and other factors. They often require long travel and waiting times, too.

As a result, about one in five people purchase water from neighbors connected to public or private utility lines. This practice, known as resale, is either illegal or informal in many places.

Stanford researchers are challenging the logic of discouraging resale. Their findings show that resale is as good or better than standpipes in terms of quality, quantity, convenience and price of water, and that current tariffs on the practice penalize the poor. The Stanford findings were published in a recent issue of the Journal of Water, Sanitation and Hygiene for Development.

Resale's prohibition in most of sub-Saharan Africa for public health reasons is a red herring, said studies co-author Jennifer Davis, an associate professor of civil and environmental engineering and a senior fellow at the Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment. ""The same concerns could be raised about standpipes and public taps that are operated directly by utilities,"" Davis said. ""Legalizing resale is generally a good thing to do, so long as appropriate water tariffs are part of the program.""

At the request of the government of Mozambique, Valentina Zuin, a doctoral student in the Emmett Interdisciplinary Program in Environment and Resources who led the research, is translating the findings into a policy and research agenda, which includes resale as a service option and a restructured water tariff. The agenda will help guide Mozambique water sector policy and infrastructure investments toward the country's goal of achieving universal urban water coverage by 2025.

Already, the Stanford research has influenced decision makers to include a water tariff reform component in a recently approved $178 million World Bank-funded project. The project will connect approximately 100,000 households in Mozambique's capital, Maputo, to the formal water supply system by expanding the city's piped-water network in unplanned areas and increasing coverage in poor inner-city neighborhoods.

Davis, Zuin and their fellow researchers make clear that the current tariff structure in Maputo, which is a typical tariff structure used in sub-Saharan Africa and beyond, penalizes the poor, including resellers and their customers, by pricing water higher for people who use it most, such as those supplying their neighbors. Resellers generally don't sell their water to maximize profit, the recently published research finds, but to meet subsistence needs, solidify relationships and reap other community-oriented benefits.

As in many other sub-Saharan African countries, resale's legal status is ambiguous in Mozambique: There is no law that either allows or prohibits it. Yet, the large majority of the population perceives it as an illegal practice. A 2011 Stanford study on the issue influenced the country's regulatory authority to launch a TV campaign to inform the public that the practice is not illegal. This has helped dispel penalty fears, and eliminated the ability of water utility employees to extort ""hush money,"" or bribes, from those who practice resale, according to Zuin. It is also expected that resale legalization will increase consumers' satisfaction with this service option.

Manuel Alvarinho, president of Mozambique's Water Regulatory Council, credited the Stanford research team with helping lay the foundation for improving access to water for the country's urban poor. ""I am very thankful to the Stanford Woods Institute, and in particular to Valentina Zuin, Jenna Davis and their team, for the high-quality work they produced, which is pioneering in Mozambique,"" Alvarinho wrote in an email.

The study's Stanford co-authors include civil and environmental engineering Professor Leonard Ortolano and doctoral student Kory Russel. Civil and environmental engineering graduate student Maika Nicholson contributed extensive research.

Peter Bhembe, has launched the Eswatini National Water Policy which seeks to promote efficient and sustainable use of water resources.

The policy, developed through a consultative process and supported by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), recognises that although a finite resource, water is essentially an “economic good” that requires strict policy adherence and monitoring.

The policy will introduce water reforms to promote the development and review of compliance frameworks that encourage the proper use of water in Eswatini. “It is worth noting that the Policy is coming up with new approaches in the development and management of our water resources,” noted the Minister.

Lessons from the recent impacts of the El Nino-induced drought in 2015 and 2016 and climate change increase the country’s risks on economic performance and food security endorsing the need for policy reform and innovation in water governance and management.

The development of the policy took into consideration key national and international frameworks and strategies that include the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and particularly SDG 6 – Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all and the National Development Strategy. The National Development Strategy (Vision 2022) set a target of 100% access to water and sanitation in line with SDG indicators 6.1 and 6.2.

Speaking at the launch, Ms. Shaima Hussein, UNDP Deputy Resident Representative, commended the government for an inclusive consultative process towards the development of the policy reiterating that it provided a collective perspective for the development of the policy. Highlighting the United Nations World Water Development Report 2019, themed “Leaving no one behind”, she emphasized how improvements in water resources management and access to water supply and sanitation services are essential to addressing various social and economic inequities, such that ‘no one is left behind’ when it comes to enjoying the multiple benefits and opportunities that water provides.

Key objectives to the policy include the promotion of integrated planning, development and management of water resources with particular emphasis on the roles and responsibilities of stakeholders; increasing access to water for previously deprived sectors of society without prejudicing existing water users; ensuring provision of adequate and good quality water for all and accessible to all citizens and transboundary obligations are met at all times.

Worldwide, millions of people still die from diseases associated with inadequate water supply, sanitation, and hygiene, despite the fact that the United Nations recognized access to clean drinking water and sanitation as a human right nearly a decade ago. The objective of this study was to describe the determinants of access to improved drinking water sources in Eswatini in 2010 and 2014. Using the Eswatini Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (EMICSs), data for 4,819 households in 2010 and 4,843 in 2014 were analyzed. Bivariate and multivariate complementary log-log regression analyses were conducted to identify the determinants of households’ access to improved drinking water sources. The study found that households’ access to improved drinking water sources significantly improved from 73.1% in 2010 to 77.7% in 2014 ( ). In 2010, households whose heads were aged 35–54 and 55 years had lower odds of having access to improved drinking water sources than those with younger ones. In 2014, female-headed households had lower odds, while, in 2010, sex of the household head was not associated with access to improved drinking water sources. In both years, an increase in the number of household members was negatively associated with access to improved drinking water sources compared to those with fewer members. In both years, the odds of access to improved drinking water sources increased with an increase in the wealth index of the household, and households located in urban areas had higher odds of access to improved drinking water sources compared to those in rural settings. In both years, households from the Shiselweni and Lubombo regions had lower odds of access to improved drinking water sources. The government and its partners should continue to upscale efforts aimed at increasing access to improved drinking water, especially in rural areas, to reduce the disparity that exists between urban and rural households.

1. Introduction

Despite the fact that the United Nations General Assembly explicitly recognized access to clean drinking water and sanitation as a human right nearly a decade ago [1], each year, millions of people around the world (mostly children) still die from diseases associated with inadequate water supply, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH). Projections show that, by the year 2050, more than half of the world’s population will live under moderate water stress, with 80% of these located in developing regions [2]. Even though the proportion of the global population using improved drinking water sources stood at 91% in 2015 (a Millennium Development Goal (MDG) target achieved by the year 2010), 785 million people still lacked basic drinking water services in 2017 [3], while 159 million still collected drinking water directly from surface water sources (58% of whom live in sub-Saharan Africa) [4]. As many nations work towards meeting target 6.1 of Goal 6 of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), aimed at achieving universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water for all by the year 2030 [5], it is important to document the determinants of access to improved drinking water sources in order to identify key areas and disparities that nations still need to address as they strive to meet this target.

Generally, drinking water is defined as water used for domestic purposes, such as drinking, cooking, and personal hygiene. However, in this study, we restricted our definition of drinking water to water used for drinking only, because the outcome variable in this study asked participants about their main source of water for drinking only. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines an improved drinking water source as a source that, by nature of its construction, adequately protects the water from outside contamination, in particular, from faecal matter, such as having a piped household water connection, a public standpipe, a borehole, a protected dug well, a protected spring, and/or rainwater collection [6]. Having access to improved water and sanitation is associated with lower morbidity [7, 8], lower mortality, and a lower risk of diarrhea among children (<5 years) [7, 9]. On the other hand, the risk of mortality from access to unimproved water sources is reportedly higher among children aged less than 5 years [10], while absent, inadequate, or inappropriately managed water services increase the risk of transmission of diseases like cholera, diarrhea, dysentery, hepatitis A, typhoid, schistosomiasis, and polio [4].

The effects of improved drinking water quality on early childhood growth have been well documented, whereby the risk of children being underweight is reportedly lower among children from households with improved drinking water than from those with unimproved water sources [11]. The World Bank [12] argued that when water comes from improved and more accessible sources, people spend less time and effort physically collecting it, and that allows them to be productive in other ways while enjoying greater personal safety as the need to make long or risky journeys to collect water is eliminated. In the long run, having improved drinking water sources also translates to less expenditure on health, as people are less likely to fall ill and incur medical costs [12]. Access to improved drinking water sources can also ensure better health and, therefore, better school attendance for children as they become risk free from water-related diseases [4].

Even though the target for safe drinking water was the first of all the MDGs to be met, disparities still exist between countries in sub-Saharan Africa and between rural and urban settings in those countries [13]. Previous research has shown that in Africa some of the factors associated with access to improved household water sources include the place of residence, wealth status [14–16], education, ethnicity, access to electricity, gender, water collection time, and the number of rooms in a household [17]. However, few of these studies have used more than one data collection point to examine the prevalence and determinants of access to improved drinking water sources. Investigating such patterns is beneficial for countries as it provides them with data to assess the impact of national efforts towards meeting the SDG targets.

The Eswatini government has made efforts to provide safe drinking water to its population through various measures, such as drilling boreholes throughout the country; however, such initiatives have been hampered by the high poverty rate as locals often do not afford to pay for the maintenance of these boreholes, further perpetuating the problem of inadequate safe drinking water in the country. Even though one of the goals set out in the National Development Strategy includes achieving universal access to safe water, the country is still far behind in achieving its targeted 100% coverage by the year 2022 [12]. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the determinants of access to improved drinking water sources in the country. This will enable stakeholders to identify underlying factors associated with the disparities so that national efforts can be directed at addressing those underlying factors. However, there is a scarcity of published studies from Eswatini that could provide data to inform programming related to access to improved drinking water sources, since even the available Eswatini 2010 and 2014 Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (EMICS) reports present descriptive data and do not present inferential statistics. For that reason, this study was conducted to (1) describe the prevalence of access to improved drinking water sources among households in 2010 and 2014 in Eswatini and (2) identify the determinants of access to improved drinking water sources in Eswatini in these years.

2. Materials and Methods

2.1. Study Context

Eswatini is a landlocked country in Southern Africa surrounded by Mozambique on the east and South Africa on the western side, measuring 17364 km2, with a population of about 1.1 million, 78% of whom live in rural areas [18]. The country has an overall population growth rate of 1.8%, a per capita Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of US$2,776, with the main drivers of the economy being agriculture and manufacturing, yet 63% of the population lives below the poverty line. The literacy level stands at 87.5%, while unemployment stands at 28.1%. The primary development challenges for the country include a high rate of poverty and inequality [19]. The country’s surface water resources are estimated at 4.5 km3/year, with 42% originating from South Africa, while an estimated 78% of the rural population depends on groundwater supply. The country is prone to climate-related shocks, such as droughts, with the most recent one (El Niño) occurring in 2015/2016. This drought left the country with extremely low water levels in dams, coupled with drying up of rural boreholes, forcing the government to ration water and resulting in many communities relying on external water supply support [12].

The number of people with access to improved water in Eswatini is low, especially in rural areas (63%), with tap water making up 44% of rural supply, groundwater at 31.5%, and surface water up to 21% [20]. Countrywide, for most households (62%), adult females or children usually collect drinking water when the source is not on the premises (which is usually the case in about 50% of rural households) [21]. Such low access to improved drinking water sources could be a contributing factor to the high childhood mortality and morbidity in Eswatini compared to other countries in sub-Saharan Africa [22], as the infant mortality rate stands at 50 deaths per 1,000 live births while the under-five mortality rate is at 67 deaths per 1,000 live births [21]. In-country reports show that the lack of safe water quality accounts for 200 deaths among children per year [23].

2.2. Study Design and Data Source

This study was a secondary analysis of data from the 2010 and 2014 EMICSs. The MICS is an international initiative by the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) to assist countries in collecting and analyzing data to fill data gaps for monitoring the situation of children, women, and men in developing countries. It is a cross-sectional household survey conducted every three to five years to enable countries to capture rapid changes in key indicators such as those related to health, education, and mortality. In MICS, data are collected using standardized survey tools through face-to-face interviews among nationally representative samples of households [24].

2.3. Sampling Design and Study Samples

The 2010 EMICS was based on a nationally representative sample of 5,475 households selected from 365 clusters, also known as enumeration areas (EAs) in the four regions of the country. Among the sampled households, a total of 4,834 households were successfully interviewed, which included 4,956 women aged 15–49 years and 4,646 men aged 15–59 years. The overall household response rate was 95%. A detailed description of the sampling design for the 2010 EMICS is available elsewhere [25].

In the 2014 EMICS, a total of 347 EAs and 5,211 households were selected for the survey. The urban and rural areas within each region were identified as the main sampling strata. Within each stratum, a sample of 15 households was selected systematically using probability proportional to size in each EA, stratified by region, urban, and rural. A total of 4,762 women (15–49 years) and 1,459 men (15–59 years) were successfully interviewed from 4,865 households. A detailed description of the sampling design for the 2014 EMICS is available elsewhere [21].

In this study, for both years, the target population was household heads aged 15 years and above. In the 2010 sample, nine household heads had missing responses on their education level; one did not report the main source of drinking water and five reported other main sources of drinking water not listed in the questionnaire; hence they were excluded from the analysis; thus, data for 4,819 households’ heads were retained in the analysis for the 2010 sample. In the 2014 EMICS, 18 heads of households had missing data on their education level, two did not report their main sources of drinking water, and another two reported other main sources of drinking water not listed in the questionnaire; hence these were excluded from the analysis, making the remaining sample analyzed to be 4,843 for 2014.

2.4. Variables

2.4.1. Dependent Variable

The dependent variable in this study was “household access to improved drinking water sources.” It was generated as a binary variable (coded as 1 if the household had access to improved drinking water sources and 0 if it had no access to improved drinking water sources). In 2010, there were 3,582 (73.1%) households that had access to improved drinking water sources. In 2014, 3,488 (77.7%) households had access to improved drinking water sources. In both of the EMICSs, household heads were asked to report if they had access to any of the following improved drinking water sources as their main source of drinking water: piped water into the dwelling, water piped to a yard or plot, piped water to a neighbour, a public water tap or standpipe, a borehole or tube well, a protected well, a protected spring, rainwater, and/or bottled water. In this study, heads of households who answered “yes” to any one of the improved drinking water sources options was deemed to be having access to improved drinking water sources.

2.4.2. Explanatory Variables

Potential determinants of access to improved drinking water sources were identified during the literature review [16, 26, 27], and these included age of the household head (15–34, 35–54, 55, and above), sex of the household head (male, female), education level of the household head (no education, primary, secondary, high school, and tertiary), household size (1–3, 4–6, 7, and more), household wealth index (poorest, poor, middle, rich, and richest), place of residence (rural/urban), and region (Hhohho, Manzini, Shiselweni, and Lubombo). Other available potential explanatory variables in EMICS (such as the distance of water source from the household and how long it took in minutes to reach the water source) were excluded in the analysis because they had extensive missing data.

2.5. Statistical Analysis

Stata 15 [28] was used to perform descriptive and explanatory analyses for each survey year. First, univariate analysis was performed to estimate the distribution of the sample and proportion of households with improved drinking water sources and households with no access to improved drinking water sources along with for a Chi-square test for comparison of household characteristics by access to improved drinking water status. All analyses were weighted to account for sampling variations in the cluster, due to the complex nature of the sampling design of the EMICSs. A two-sample, two-tailed z-test was performed to determine if the difference in the weighted proportions of households’ access to improved drinking water sources between the two survey years was statistically significant. Second, a bivariate logistic and complementary log-log regression analyses (i.e., crude models) were run with each of the explanatory variables regressed against the outcome to determine which variables to include in the final model [29]. Third, multivariate logistic models were fitted and later validated with complementary log-log regressions (clog log). The clog log model was appropriate for the data because the probability of households’ access to improved water sources is very large [30]. Following the literature [31–33], model coefficients were exponentiated to derive crude odds ratios (COR) with their 95% confidence intervals (CI). In the final model, results were reported using adjusted odds ratios (AORs) and their 95% CIs, at an alpha level of 0.05 in both models. Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) were used for model selection. The model with the smallest AIC and BIC was considered to be the best fit model of the two models under consideration. The model fit statistics for the complementary log-log models are shown in Table 3. The clog log models had the lowest fit statistics in both survey years, AIC (4250.86) and BIC (4367.50), in 2010, while, in 2014, we have AIC (4495.19) and BIC (4611.93). The model fit statistics suggested that the clog log model was the parsimonious model, and therefore the results from the clog log model were interpreted. For the results of the logistic regression, see Table S1 for comprehensive analysis.

2.6. Ethical Considerations

The study datasets are publicly available from the UNICEF website (https://mics.unicef.org/surveys) and were deidentified of all participants’ identifiers before being deposited in the UNICEF data repository. The Eswatini Central Statistics Office ensured ethical compliance during the implementation of the surveys, including the application for protocol approval from the Scientific and Ethics Committee of the Ministry of Health in Eswatini.

3. Results

3.1. Sociodemographic Characteristics of the Samples

Table 1 shows the distribution of the study sample by survey year. Of the total sample of households heads included in the analysis in 2010 (4,819) and 2014 (4,843), there was a relatively similar distribution of the heads of households aged 35–54 years (38.9% in 2010 and 39.6% in 2014). Slightly above half (53.4% in 2010 and 52.6% in 2014) of the households had males as their heads. A majority of the households, 29.1% in both 2010 and 2014, had their heads having a primary school level education. Just over a quarter (26% in 2010) and 21.6% in 2014 of the households were classified under the richest quartile. As expected, a majority of the households were located in rural areas (56.7% in 2010 and 73.5% in 2014) (Table 1).

Table 2 shows the results of the overall prevalence of access to improved drinking water sources and the distribution of the study samples by explanatory variables in each survey year, with the corresponding Chi-square values. The overall access to improved drinking water significantly improved from 73.1% (95% CI: 71.8–74.4) in 2010 to 77.7% (95% CI: 76.4–78.9) in 2014 ( ). Households’ access to improved drinking water sources was significantly different by sex of the household head in both survey years (55.8% vs. 44.2% in 2010 and 56.7% vs. 43.3 in 2014, in both years). In both survey years, there were also significant differences in households’ access to improved drinking water sources by age, household size, educational level of household head, location of the household by urban vs. rural, region, and wealth index (all in both years).

3.2. Determinants of Households’ Access to Improved Drinking Water Sources

Table 3 depicts the bivariate and multivariate clog log results. In the multivariate model, in 2010, households with a household head aged 35–54 years (AOR = 0.87, 95% CI: 0.78, 0.97) and those aged 55 years and older (AOR = 0.80, 95% CI: 0.70, 0.90) were less likely to have access to improved drinking water sources than those with a household head aged 15–34 years, holding other variables constant in the model. However, in 2014, there was no significant association between the age of the household head and household access to improved drinking water sources.

In 2014, households, whose heads were female, were less likely to have access to improved drinking water sources (AOR = 0.91, 95% CI: 0.83, 0.99), holding other covariates constant in the model. There was no significant association between the sex of the household head and household access to improved drinking water sources in 2010. Households (HH) with 4–6 members vs. those with 1–3 members were less likely to have access to improved drinking water sources (AOR = 0.89, 95% CI: 0.80, 0.98) in 2010. In 2014, those HH with 4–6 and with 7 and more members were less likely to have access to improved drinking water sources (AOR = 0.88, 95% CI: 0.79, 0.97) and (AOR = 0.87, 95% CI: 0.76, 0.99), respectively, compared to those with 1–3 members. In 2010, compared to households in the poorest wealth quartile, those in the poor quartiles (AOR = 1.68, 95% CI: 1.44, 1.97), middle (AOR = 2.02, 95% CI: 1.74, 2.36), rich (AOR = 2.63, 95% CI: 2.25, 3.07), and richest quartiles (AOR = 3.71, 95% CI: 3.11, 4.43) were more likely to have access to improved drinking water sources. The odds of access to improved drinking water sources by wealth index were even higher in 2014, for the rich (AOR = 2.98, 95% CI: 2.55, 3.50) and richest (AOR = 4.58, 95% CI: 3.76, 5.57), holding all other variables constant in the model. Households located in urban areas had higher odds of access to improved drinking water sources compared to those in rural areas (AOR = 1.70, 95% CI: 1.54, 1.88) in 2010 and (AOR = 2.13, 95% CI: 1.87, 2.42) in 2014. In 2010, households from the Manzini (AOR = 0.73, 95% CI: 0.65, 0.83), Shiselweni (AOR = 0.53, 95% CI: 0.47, 0.61), and Lubombo (AOR = 0.67, 95% CI: 0.59, 0.76) regions were less likely to have access to improved drinking water sources, compared to households in the Hhohho region. Similarly, in 2014, households from the Shiselweni and Lubombo regions were less likely to have access to improved drinking water sources than those from the Hhohho region (AOR = 0.67, 95% CI: 0.59, 0.75) and (AOR = 0.73, 95% CI: 0.64, 0.84), respectively (Table 3).

4. Discussion

This study found an overall increase in the proportion of households accessing improved drinking water sources between 2010 and 2014 and that several determinants accounted for households’ access to improved drinking water sources in the two survey years. The observed improvement in households’ access to improved drinking water sources is in line with SDG number six, to ensure universal access to clean water by 2030 [3]. The observed improvement in access to improved water sources in Eswatini may be attributed in part to the positive effects of national efforts aimed at improving access to safe water in communities more so because both surveys were conducted before the 2015/2016 El Niño drought, which would have diluted such effects, thus making it difficult to observe any gains. Worth noting is that this study reports a higher prevalence of household access to improved drinking water sources in both survey years compared to those reported in 2010 (which was 67.3%) and 2014 (which was 72%) EMICS reports [21, 25]. The discrepancies could be due to differences in the definitions of improved drinking water sources in this study vs. the original definitions in the EMICSs. In this study, the definition of the outcome variable was limited to water sources used for drinking only, similar to other studies [26, 27], while, in the MICS reports, improved drinking water sources include water used for drinking and other domestic purposes. However, the prevalence of access to improved drinking water sources reported in this study is comparable (at 74%) to those reported in a majority of countries in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) [26, 34, 35].

Evidence from a study done in several SSA countries suggested that the older the household head, the less likely the household had access to improved drinking water sources [36]. This study found that, in both survey years, the older the household head, the lower the chances of having access to improved drinking water sources. For example, households headed by persons aged 35–54 and 55 and above were less likely to have access to the improved drinking water sources. One plausible explanation for this finding could be that, in our sample, a majority of older household heads (i.e., 35 years and older) were from poor households and mainly from rural areas and therefore could not afford improved drinking water sources (see Table 1, 2014 sample).

The study also found that households that were headed by females were less likely to have access to improved drinking water sources. Similar to other developing countries [36, 37], men in Eswatini often make decisions on water management even though women are responsible for water collection. In different traditional settings, women still hold very little influence in committees for boreholes and other community water projects [36, 38]. This finding conflicts with most studies, which found that female-headed households were more likely to have access to improved drinking water sources [14, 26, 39]. The reason could be that a majority of the households with low access to improved drinking water sources in our study were located in rural areas, where most of the HH are headed by females, many of whom are housewives and therefore do not have adequate financial resources to acquire improved drinking water sources. In Eswatini, about 70% of the population lives in rural areas, yet more than 60% of the population lives below the poverty line [19].

Education is regarded as a socioeconomic indicator [40]. Current evidence in literature indicates a positive relationship between the educational attainment of the household head and the likelihood of having access to improved drinking water sources [39]. Contrary to the literature, this study found no significant difference in household access to the improved drinking water source by the education level of the household head, possibly because affordability seemed to be the main issue for many HH with access to unimproved water sources in this study sample, especially in rural areas. Similar to a multicountry study conducted in SSA, whereby households with small sizes were found to be more likely to have access to improved drinking water sources [14], this study also found that household size significantly predicted households’ access to improved drinking water sources in both survey years. Larger household sizes translate to huge water consumption and increased expenditures in water bills and maintenance fees. Households in poor traditional settings tend to have high fertility, validating the presumption of a potential positive causal relationship between poverty and high fertility in developing countries [41]. In this study, the higher the socioeconomic status of a household, the higher the odds of access to improved drinking water sources, implying that rich households have better access to resources and therefore have the better financial capacity to afford access to improved water sources [14, 16, 42].

The findings in this study also showed that there were higher odds of access to improved drinking water sources among households in urban areas (a 43 points increase between the two years), in line with studies conducted in Ghana and Vietnam, whereby households in urban areas were also found to have higher odds of access to improved drinking water sources [27, 43]. The scarcity of improved drinking water in rural areas is well documented and is evidenced by the high prevalence of waterborne illness in rural areas such as diarrhea, schistosomiasis, trachoma, and intestinal helminths which can be attributed explicitly to unsafe water, poor sanitation, and the lack of hygiene [39]. Improvements in the water supply or water quality have been cited to be one of the effective interventions to reduce diarrheal diseases up to one third [40]. The finding of Shiselweni and Lubombo households having lower odds of access to improved drinking water sources was not surprising, considering that these two regions are less developed and have more rural settings compared to the Hhohho and Manzini regions, which further highlights that unaffordability might be the main issue in many households. Other studies have also reported disparities among regions in different countries concerning household access to improved drinking water supply [27, 42].

4.1. Strengths and Limitations

This study is among the first to document the determinants of improved drinking water sources in Eswatini. The study analyzed data collected at two time points using similar survey methods, which enables direct comparisons between the two survey points. The study findings provide evidence of national progress towards meeting the SDG 6 target. In the two EMICSs, households were drawn from all the four administrative regions in the country using a multistage sampling design, which ensured that the households were representative of each region and subsequently of the entire country, thus enhancing the generalizability of the findings. This study also accounted for the complex sampling design of the two surveys in the analysis through weighting, which further increased the internal and external validity of the study. Therefore, power for inference can be regarded as the strength of this study due to the national representativeness of the data and the large sample size.

Despite the above mentioned strengths, the study is not immune to a number of limitations. First, the findings should be interpreted with caution since, by their design, MICSs are cross-sectional and therefore cannot establish causality between the explanatory variables and households’ access to improved drinking water sources. Second, even though the definition of the outcome variable was drawn from that of the joint monitoring program of the water supply of the WHO and UNICEF, the use of the phrase “improved water” should not be mistaken to mean clean water. Third, recall bias and misreporting cannot be ruled out in the MICSs as participants have to recall or provide estimates for some of the variables, such as household size and wealth. Desirability bias can also not be ruled out as participants may have misreported their age, wealth, and education level, which would reduce or amplify the real effects of the explanatory variables on the outcome variable, thus introducing information bias. Lastly, the study cannot be free from residual confounding as some variables cannot be said to be perfectly measured in MICSs, since it was not possible to analyze all the potential explanatory variables identified in literature as this study was a secondary analysis; hence variable selection was limited to the available variables in the two MICSs and by the amount of missing or nonmissing data for those variables. However, Eswatini complies with the procedures of MICSs; hence these limitations cannot outweigh the strength of the study.

5. Conclusions and Recommendations

The study found that the proportion of households with access to improved drinking water sources increased significantly from 73.1% in 2010 to 77.7% in 2014. The findings showed that, among the demographic factors, households headed by persons older than 34 years and by females were less likely to have access to improved drinking water sources. The study also found that the odds of households’ access to improved drinking water sources were lower among households with more than three persons and that households’ wealth index was positively associated with improved drinking water sources. The study further showed that regional and urban-rural disparities in access to improved drinking water sources still exist in Eswatini.

In light of the findings, several recommendations are proposed. Even though the results showed that the country is on track towards meeting SDG and strategic national targets regarding access to improved drinking water, there is a need for the government and its partners to continue to upscale efforts aimed at increasing access to improved drinking water, especially in rural areas to reduce the disparity that exists between urban and rural households. The Ministry of Health should continue advocating for the use of family planning commodities in the country to maintain small household sizes so that resources remain optimal for families to be able to afford all necessities, such as access to an improved water source. There is also a need to focus on households in the lower wealth categories by proposing practical and affordable means of accessing improved water sources, such as educating them about rain-water harvesting techniques and providing them with the financial support to acquire and maintain storage facilities for the harvested water. Such education campaigns could be conducted by engaging already existing programs such as the Rural Health Motivators’ program (i.e., community health workers) and Community Development Officers program (for resource mobilization) so that such efforts do not add an extra financial burden to the government. Lastly, future studies should collect more explanatory variables and conduct multilevel analysis to tease out community and regional level effects of the determinants on access to improved drinking water sources.

Swaziland is a land locked country located in the Southern tip of Africa. It borders the countries of South Africa and Mozambique. It is unique in that it is one of the only true monarchies left in the world. At its head is King Mswati III. Like many countries throughout the world and particularly in Africa, access to water and the availability of water are becoming hard to obtain and often water access are only for those considered to be elite.

In a landlocked country access to water inevitably comes through access to ground water. In Swaziland 3,000 boreholes have been drilled in the country since 1986. However, 40 percent of the population does not have access to clean water and in some cases, 90 percent of some community's water projects are not functioning. Also, those in charge of these water projects often lack the knowledge needed to keep them running. Many people have to travel long distances and wait for the water to services. Often times near by are pumps for boreholes, however they have broken down and have not been fixed. Making it difficult for many people around the region to get access to clean water.

Another problem seen in Swaziland is that about only 10 percent of Swaziland ground water has been accessed, however 90 percent of the countries citizens depend on that groundwater. Many of which are from rural areas.

One component not usually mentioned is the fact that in Swaziland and many other African countries, foreign investors have a big influence on the country's economy. In Swaziland there have been threats of investors pulling out of the country due to the water scarcity issues.

Overall, water scarcity issues continue to persist and it will take time and change to combat the issues of water scarcity. The majority of the issues revolve around lack of access and knowledge. Swaziland in particular needs to take the steps to increase education and knowledge about how the water pumps work and how to fix them when they break down. Also, if the pumps are not reliable and or they don't have the resources to educate their citizens then the government needs to develop an alternative plan that allows access to the precious ground water in which so many Swazi's depend on. In Swaziland in where the country is one of the only truly remaining monarchies it will be up to the king whether or not he sees prosperity through this otherwise tragic crisis currently unfolding in this Southern African nation.","In a landlocked country access to water inevitably comes through access to ground water.

390,https://reliefweb.int/report/swaziland/swaziland-govt-looks-ways-bring-water-people,Swaziland: Govt looks at ways to bring water to people - Eswatini,"MBABANE, 22 March 2007 (IRIN) - As Swaziland battles with yet another rainless year, the government has launched an initiative to find long-term solutions to end the water crisis.

An Emergency Water Crisis Committee was formed on Wednesday, when government leaders and water-resource experts convened in the commercial town of Manzini, 35km southeast of the capital, Mbabane, to confront water-scarcity issues.

The Ministry of Natural Resources warned the meeting of diminishing stream flows, lower water levels in all dams, and an expected fall in groundwater levels if the dry spell persisted. In the last few months, Swaziland has suffered delayed rainfall, heavy winds and hailstorms, followed by scorching dry spells, which have all contributed to the worst food shortage in 25 years.

Some urban areas have been rationing water, but the natural resources ministry complained that the short-term solution of supplying town residents with water trucks was expensive. The Swaziland Water Services Board has 27,000 industrial and household customers in urban areas, but the country's urban population is ten times that number, indicating that populous informal settlements without access to piped water must be struggling to obtain water from attenuated streams and other sources.

Christopher Fakudze, an economist seconded to the Ministry of Natural Resources to project water needs and the costs of water-resource management, told IRIN, ""Fifty-four percent of Swazis have access to clean water; ten years ago it was 33 percent. It is a rise, but not as anticipated originally. We should be at 61 percent now, according to our projections.""

Fakudze cited lack of rainfall as the immediate cause of Swaziland's water shortage. ""Even the water tables, the aquifers, are affected according to our engineers. People drill, but in a number of cases there are dry wells.""

According to Deputy Prime Minister Constance Simelane, ""The country is small enough so we should be able to pipe water everywhere.""

""Swaziland does have a water supply crisis, but in some places it's a matter of lack of delivery"", said Jameson Mkhonta, public affairs officer at the Swaziland Water Services Board and vice chairman of the Water Crisis Committee.

Reliance on gravity to bring water from the mountainous north, where rainfall is usually adequate, to the parched lowland in the south is the centerpiece of a nationwide water delivery grid discussed on Wednesday, which also highlighted a need for additional reservoirs in the north and south.

The natural resources ministry plans to exploit water from the Komati River flowing through the Hhohho Region in the north of the country, as well as water from the Maguga Dam, which is shared with South Africa, by piping irrigation water across more than 80 percent of the country's length to Lavumisa in the south.

""Swaziland is geographically a small place, and there is no reason why we cannot pipe water ... to every area. The drought has made water unavailable - hopefully, just temporarily - but the drought has awakened us to the need for action,"" said Fakudze.

Opinions differ on whether Swaziland could become self-sufficient in this commodity. ""We need to find ways to harvest additional water, because we cannot supply all the people from the resources we have, even though it is a small country,"" Fakudze suggested.

Mkhonta said that once the drought ended and rainfall returned to normal, an opportunity would be at hand to put in place a nationwide water harvesting and storage infrastructure to stabilise supplies.

Various rivers flow across northern Swaziland, ""so if we had the money to interconnect these rivers, we could become self-sufficient in water during summer,"" he commented. ""If we just had some means of harvesting the water during the rainy season, then we could achieve water self-sufficiency all year round.""

AGRO-BASED ECONOMY

Ninety percent of rural agricultural schemes including farmers' cooperatives and food security initiatives are based on groundwater sources, but drilling is expensive, and pumping equipment is imported from the United States of America, making maintenance difficult.

""We have short-term solutions to the immediate crisis of bringing water to people, but we must look to long-term solutions,"" Deputy Prime Minister Simelane told IRIN.

The prolonged dry weather has complicated recovery from a humanitarian crisis that includes widespread HIV/AIDS and chronic poverty.

""People living with HIV require clean water. Poverty alleviation plans centered on agricultural projects have been compromised by lack of water. We have the ability to end water scarcity. Once the international community sees we are making efforts toward water security, I am sure they will assist us"", said Simelane.

Swaziland's has an agriculturally- based economy, and irrigation takes up 95 percent of the nation's water demand, of which 90 percent is used by sugar cane cultivation, mostly on large commercial plantations.

Communal farmers depend on rainfall to produce most of the country's staple food, maize, and the lack of irrigation on Swazi Nation Land is a major contributor to the ongoing food shortage, according to the Baphalali Red Cross Society, a key distributor of emergency food relief.

Although the Ministry of Natural Resources told the emergency water conference on Wednesday that boreholes alone could not meet the country's water needs, Mkhonta told IRIN, ""We haven't exploited groundwater supplies much - we are on the verge of exploring them.""

[END]","MBABANE, 22 March 2007 (IRIN) - As Swaziland battles with yet another rainless year, the government has launched an initiative to find long-term solutions to end the water crisis.
An Emergency Water Crisis Committee was formed on Wednesday, when government leaders and water-resource experts convened in the commercial town of Manzini, 35km southeast of the capital, Mbabane, to confront water-scarcity issues.
Some urban areas have been rationing water, but the natural resources ministry complained that the short-term solution of supplying town residents with water trucks was expensive.
The Swaziland Water Services Board has 27,000 industrial and household customers in urban areas, but the country's urban population is ten times that number, indicating that populous informal settlements without access to piped water must be struggling to obtain water from attenuated streams and other sources.

The funding comes as large parts of southern Africa are currently in the grip of their harshest drought in decades.

“Many poor households in drought-affected areas in southern African countries are struggling to have enough food due to crop failure, reduced access to water and, in some places, unaffordable food prices in markets. EU humanitarian aid will help deliver food to those most in need and tackle the hunger crisis in fragile rural communities,” said Janez Lenarčič, Commissioner for Crisis Management.

In Zimbabwe, €16.8 million from this aid package will boost food and nutrition assistance, as well as improving access to basic health care, clean water and providing protection to vulnerable people. The remaining amount will be channelled to providing food assistance and nutrition support in Eswatini, Madagascar, Lesotho and Zambia.

The Southern Africa and Indian Ocean region, as a whole, is prone to natural disasters and oscillates between droughts and floods that are destroying harvests and further weakening fragile communities. Since January 2019, the EU has allocated a total of €67.95 million for humanitarian assistance across the region. The bulk of this funding went for emergency relief assistance in the wake of natural disasters (cyclones Idai and Kenneth), food assistance, and helping at-risk communities equip themselves better to face climate-related disasters.

Background

As many as 12 million people in the region are at risk of hunger because of extended periods of below-average rainfall, interspersed with floods, on top of the economic challenges that some countries in the region are grappling with. In Zimbabwe alone, a 7.7 million people, half of the country's population, are at the risk of facing severe hunger, placing Zimbabwe among the states facing one of the worst food crises in the world.

392,https://jobs.undp.org/cj_view_job.cfm?cur_job_id=93217,93217- Assessment of Climate Change Impact on Water Resou,"The Government of the Kingdom of Eswatini has ratified the Paris Agreement that seeks to hold the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 °C above preindustrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 °C above preindustrial levels. In addition, Eswatini has submitted its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The NDC is considered as a policy document which has an overall objective of putting the country on a Low carbon climate resilient pathway and aimed at assisting the country to contribute towards the achievement of the global temperature goal. As a developing country with about 69% of the population living on less than $1, the Nationally Determined Contribution for Eswatini to Paris Agreement on Climate change emphasizes adaptation measures while at the same time reducing greenhouse emissions by 20% by 2030 from the business as usual baseline of 2010. eSwatini’s development challenges are exacerbated by its vulnerability to external and climate-related shocks, including floods and droughts which negatively impact on health, food security and productive economic activity while disproportionately affecting the rural poor. Mitigation and adaptation measures are important given the strong role of the agriculture sector, as well as the large share of the population in rural areas relying on subsistence agriculture. The surface water resources of eSwatini are estimated at 4.5 km3/year with 42 percent originating from South Africa. The five main river systems in the country are the Komati, the Lomati, the Mbuluzi, the Usutu and the Ngwavuma. The Komati and the Lomati river systems are found in the north of the country and both originate in South Africa and flow out of eSwatini back into South Africa before entering Mozambique. The Mbuluzi River rises in eSwatini and flows into Mozambique. The Usutu River, together with major tributaries originate in South Africa, and flows out into Mozambique, forming the border between Mozambique and South Africa. The Ngwavuma River lies in the south of the country. It rises in eSwatini and flows into South Africa before entering Mozambique. The sixth river system contributing to surface water in eSwatini is the Pongola River, which is found on the South African side south of Swaziland. The Jozini dam, built on the South African side, floods some land on the eSwatini side and its water is available for use in eSwatini. Most recently, in 2015/16 eSwatini experienced a severe El Niño-induced drought, characterized by below normal rainfall, prolonged dry spells and above normal temperatures. The drought was the worst experienced by the country in 50 years, leading to a 30-40 percent drop in production of maize (the staple food crop), extremely low water levels in the main Hawane dam serving the capital, drying up of rural boreholes and forcing the closure of many schools (affecting nearly 200,000 students and teachers, in rural and urban areas). During the drought, persistent severe water shortages both in rural and urban areas (affecting many of the 300,000 people facing food shortages) caused the Government to ration water and many communities to rely on external water supply support. The drought had long-term impacts on ground water supply (of which 78 percent of the rural population depends on) due to the poor recharge of aquifers. Health facilities and schools experienced compromised service delivery or temporary closure due to lack of water, and an increase in the number of diarrhea cases was reported. Climate change in Swaziland is expected to lead to overall warming and drying, with a greater frequency and intensity of droughts as well as floods. The negative impacts on the agricultural and water sector are likely to be considerable. Following COP-21, attention has turned from developing and submitting NDCs to revising and updating the NDCs for a more ambitious and inclusive effective implementation of the contributions. UNDP plays a central role in building countries’ capacity to strengthen and implement NDCs, given its previous INDC support experience, its technical expertise in related areas, and its on-the-ground presence in over 170 countries. As part of enhancing climate action in Eswatini in line with her commitment to Paris Agreement, Government has embarked on the NDC revision process under the Climate Action Enhancement Package (CAEP) with support from development partners that include, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), Commonwealth Secretariat, Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), World Resources Institute (WRI); and NDC Partnership Support Unit. UNDP through its Climate Promise Initiative is supporting Eswatini to revise her NDC commitment including; i) Building Political Will, whole of government and whole of society ownership; ii) Review, align and update existing targets, policies and measures; iii) Incorporate new sectors and/or GHGs; iv) Assess costs and Investment opportunities for attaining targets; v) establish mechanisms to monitor progress & strengthen transparency; and vi) Preparing the revised NDC document. It is against this background that UNDP is seeking a competent consultant to support Ministry of Tourism and Environmental Affairs in collaboration with other NDC Partnership members undertake situation analysis of climate change impact on water resources including water usage to enhance adaptation ambition in the NDC.","In addition, Eswatini has submitted its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).

The ability of the Kingdom of eSwatini to develop sustainably is challenged by its vulnerability to climate-related shocks, including droughts, wild fires, and floods. These stresses negatively impact health, food security and productive economic activity, while disproportionately affecting the rural poor.

In 2015-16, eSwatini experienced a severe El Niño-induced drought, leading to a 30-40 percent drop in production of maize (the staple food crop), extremely low water levels in the main Hawane dam serving the capital, drying up of rural boreholes, and forcing the closure of many schools (affecting nearly 200,000 students and teachers, in rural and urban areas).

Based on this, the government requested technical and financial support to build the necessary capacity for a more substantive and sustained drought preparedness program.

The water project was completed in November 2017, amounting to over E4.2 million funded by World Vision and the Esicojeni Foundation. As a result of the water system, more than 250 households now have access to clean water. Additionally, one primary school, four shops and six churches also benefit from the water.

The Minister applauded the partnership between World Vision and Esicojeni Foundation for making it possible for the people to get clean water. This is the second water project by World Vision opened by the minister this year. In April, another water scheme at Hosea that was funded by World Vision to the tune of E8 million was also officially opened by the minister.

The Minister also appreciated the community for working hard to make sure that this water scheme became a reality. This project runs for 37km and is supplying water to 42 running taps.

The minister further applauded the community for establishing a fund that will make sure that the project is sustained over the coming years. Currently, the water committee has collected over E27,000 from the community members.

World Vision Country Program Director in Eswantini, Francis Dube, urged the community to take ownership of the project and to take good care of it.

This system is one of many World Vision has worked with communities to install. Over the past five years, with the support of the Minister, World Vision has provided access to clean water to approximately 36,000 households or roughly 174,552 people (adults and children) in different constituencies in all the four regions of the country.

Dube extended his appreciation to the donors who have generously provided funding to continue to provide safe water to the people of Eswatini. Out of five Priority sectors that World Vision in Eswatini focuses on Water Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) consumes 40 per cent of the overall budget allocation, this on its own demonstrates the importance of the sector to us, Dube said.","The Minister of Natural Resources and Energy, the Honorable Peter Bhembe officially opened the Nyatsini Community Water Project under Sigwe Constituency.

The LoNa (Lomahasha-Namaacha) project is a transboundary water supply project that the SADC Water Fund is supporting in the region, as part of its cross border Water Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) programme. The project will see the construction of substantial infrastructure between the towns of Lomahasha in Eswatini and Namaacha in Mozambique, enabling cross-border water supply thereby more than doubling the water supply available per capita.

The aim of the project is to extend access to clean water, particularly to low-income groups and to secure the supply of water for future generations. The financing of regional water infrastructure in collaboration with cooperating partners such as the German government through (KfW) is a key part of the agenda of SADCs’ Regional Integration agenda that the DBSA actively supports in order to improve the social – economic livelihoods of the population living in the SADC Region and help build Africa’s prosperity.

After successful first phase, new financing to equip over 5,200 ha of dry land with irrigation infrastructure and replace inefficient pumping systems for a further 533 ha.

During a public ceremony in Mbabane a EUR 36.4 loan agreement was signed between the European Investment Bank and the Ministry of Finance of Eswatini, in support of phase two of the Lower Usuthu Smallholder Irrigation Project (LUSIP II) being developed by the Swaziland Water and Agricultural Development Enterprise (SWADE). Following on the LUSIP I project, which had the objective of storing water to enable year-round agricultural production, LUSIP II will enlarge the available irrigated farmland for local smallholders. The design of the bulk storage facility (Lubovane Dam), constructed under LUSIP I, envisaged a command area of 11,500ha, this includes LUSIP II.

LUSIP is a climate adaptation initiative to alleviate poverty and improve food security through sustainable agriculture in Lowveld, one of the driest and poorest areas of land-locked Eswatini, where over 70% of the population relies on subsistence farming and one in three people are undernourished. The project is based on an integrated bottom-up approach of social and economic empowerment throughout project identification, preparation and implementation, supporting the introduction of commercial farming in the area.

The final beneficiaries are predominantly smallholder homesteads that will be grouped into Farmer Companies (FCs) to operate the irrigation systems and adopt modern farming technologies, with efficient use of water and energy resources. LUSIP II will directly benefit about 2,300 smallholder households and 10,000 people, with a further 10,000 indirectly benefiting through connected activities.

Through the provision of irrigation services, LUSIP II will provide a strong boost to the agricultural economy and is expected to have considerable spillovers on job creation, private sector development, health conditions, as well as on environmental protection through decreased land degradation. Sugarcane cultivation will cover a maximum of 70% of the irrigated area, while at least 30% of the irrigated area shall be allocated to other food and cash crops.

“I think I don’t have to stress the importance of water for agriculture, so its efficient management really is crucial.” commented EIB Vice-President Ambroise Fayolle. ”LUSIP II is a flagship project in many respects, especially as it will strongly support as many as seven sustainable development goals. The first phase of the Lower Usuthu project was a great success, adding over 6,000 ha of irrigated land to Eswatini’s agricultural basin. Now, with new canals right up to the farmers’ land, as well as new pumping systems to replace the old ones, local farmers may have really fruitful times ahead.”

The Ambassador of the European Union to Eswatini, H.E. Esmeralda Hernandez Aragones, added that: ""LUSIP II is fully aligned with the EU National Indicative Programme (NIP) for 2014 – 2020 which singles out agriculture as one of the two key focal areas of intervention, with a view to addressing existing challenges and promoting sound agricultural practices, eradicate food insecurity, and contributing to sustainable economic growth. By supporting such projects the EU aims to contribute meaningfully to Eswatini's development initiatives thus helping the country to achieve economic growth and prosperity.""

Samson Sithole, the CEO of SWADE, added: “In LUSIP II EIB has provided substantial non-financial value added in terms of project preparation since 2012. Thanks to its early involvement, it helped SWADE design a bankable and sustainable project - especially with respect to scoping, structuring, technical solutions, as well as social and environmental standards - incorporating lessons learnt from LUSIP I and EU's best practice”","Following on the LUSIP I project, which had the objective of storing water to enable year-round agricultural production, LUSIP II will enlarge the available irrigated farmland for local smallholders.

September 2018. Credit: Braimah Apambire/DRI.

In August and early September 2018, several faculty members from the Desert Research Institute (DRI) found themselves far from home – teaching courses in water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) and environmental issues in the Kingdom of eSwatini, formerly known as Swaziland, a small country nestled along South Africa’s eastern border with Mozambique.

The courses, all focused on a set of interconnected environmental issues and public health challenges referred to by the acronym “WASH” (short for water, sanitation, and hygiene) are part of an ongoing WASH Capacity Building Program, operated by DRI’s Center for International Water and Sustainability (CIWAS). This program received a five-year funding award from humanitarian non-governmental organization World Vision earlier in 2018 and provides technical capacity training to field staff who work in the WASH sector in developing countries.

“The WASH Capacity Building Program is a partnership between DRI, the University of Nevada, Reno, Drexel University, and World Vision,” explained Braimah Apambire, Director of CIWAS. “We’ve developed six courses which we teach partly online and partly face-to-face, and the students take four of those courses to complete our post-graduate certificate program. In April, we taught two courses in Ghana, and the two courses that we just taught in eSwatini were the next in the series.”

The current cohort — the third since the program’s pilot season in 2016 — consists of 30 students from 18 African countries. In eSwatini, their coursework focused on water supplies and environmental management in developing countries, and on cross-cutting issues in WASH. The classes were taught by Apambire, DRI’s Rosemary Carroll, Ph.D., and Alan Heyvaert, Ph.D., and Emmanuel Opong, Ph.D., of World Vision.

The classroom time was interspersed with field trips to rural areas, dams, water and sanitation facilities, wastewater treatment plants, and more. Students got a firsthand look at some of the WASH challenges that are common in eSwatini and a chance to experience some of the region’s unique culture and countryside. CIWAS collaborators from the University of eSwatini gave guest lectures and organized field trips for the students during face-to-face teaching in the country.

“ESwatini is a mountainous country and very, very beautiful,” Apambire said. “It is a kingdom with a king who is the ruler of the country, and a traditional culture that is almost completely intact. Their government and NGOs, including World Vision, take interest in developing social programs that help people, especially the poor. But they still have rural areas that do not have water and sanitation facilities.”

Most notably, says Apambire, people of eSwatini are currently experiencing WASH challenges related to an ongoing drought, which neighboring South Africa is experiencing as well. DRI has had discussions with the University of eSwatini and some governmental departments about how the institute can help address their challenges.

“Because of the impact of climate change and reductions in rainfall, they are having some existing wells dry up,” Apambire said. “There needs to be more research to find out what some of the causes are and how to mitigate that. Artificial recharge is one option, and they probably also need to look for alternative sources of drinking water for those communities. That’s their biggest challenge right now.”

For women and girls in many African nations, challenges related to WASH impact everything from their ability to go to school each day to the survival and well-being of their children and families. For this reason, Apambire is pleased to report that, for the first time, five of the students in this year’s cohort are female.

“DRI is helping to build women leaders in this sector,” Apambire said. “Women in Africa are the ones that the burden of fetching water falls on. When you are a girl and there is no water in your village, you spend a lot of time going to fetch water, sometimes a mile or two away. Then you are not able to go to school, so it affects education. Having women become trained as WASH professionals and go back to the villages really empowers them to become a part of the implementation and management of these projects.”

This fall, students in the 2018 cohort of the WASH Capacity Building Program will finish their coursework online, with instruction from Apambire, Seshadri (Shey) Rajagopal, Ph.D. of DRI, Emmanuel Opong, Ph.D., and John Akudago, Ph.D., WASH Sector Expert. The program is now accepting applications for their 2019 cohort.

Community members preparing a concrete tank .

From the time I arrived in my community, my counterpart has been dedicated to finding a solution to the recent water crisis. After years of drought in Swaziland, access to water has become increasingly difficult. As a country largely reliant on subsistence farming, the effects of the drought have been devastating, especially in the rural areas. As part of a community-wide assessment during integration, my counterpart and I conducted homestead surveys, where families were given the opportunity to express their concerns and hopes for our community. Through these conversations, it was quickly apparent that access to water was a common issue for which they wanted a solution. In fact, most homes are over a kilometer from the nearest water source, and at certain times of the year, even those have been known to run dry. Hundreds of homesteads, schools, and the local clinic have all been affected by the drought. It is not uncommon to find that the schools aren’t serving food because of a lack of water to cook with that day.

Inner layer of the concrete tank

After attempts at other water projects were unsuccessful, my counterpart remembered a solution he had heard about years before: concrete water harvesting tanks. He couldn’t remember the organization that conducted the training on these tanks, and had lost the contact to the representative, but we set out to find them regardless. After checking with one organization in town, we were then pointed to Women in Development, the government organization that trains communities on the building of these concrete tanks. The organization offered to send trainers to our community and conduct the training over three weeks, as long as the community could provide lodging for the trainers. The concrete tanks are a great solution to the water crisis because they are lower in cost and less fragile than the commonly used plastic Jojo tanks. The concrete tanks are also built to include a filter system to ensure access to clean water, a lid that is easily removed for cleaning inside the tank, and concrete gutters that make it affordable to catch as much rainfall as possible.

There was a lot of excitement around this project once it was announced, with up to twenty community members attending the meetings before the project began. On the first day of the project, my counterpart and I worried that the rains would keep people away, but by the end of the day, twelve people had come to begin construction on the first tank. Over the course of the training, three water tanks were built, and with each new tank, community members became increasingly responsible for the construction. This was the most important part of the training, as it guaranteed that the participants would be able to continue to build more tanks on their own, making the project sustainable. The locations of the tanks built during the training were chosen based on their accessibility. One tank was built at the chief’s kraal, next to a garden benefiting the orphans and vulnerable children of the community. The other tanks were built at the primary school and preschool.

One of the challenges we faced was a fluctuation in the costs of the materials needed. The trainers and project leaders had to compromise on how we could best use the funds to get the most out of the project, making sure that the community members would still learn how to build the tanks and gutters. By working together to find a solution, we were still able to build three tanks and two sets of gutters. The concrete tanks have gained a lot of attention around the community as people have watched them be built. Several individuals, as well as the local high school, have expressed interest in having those trained build more tanks for them. As these tanks continue to build momentum, my counterparts and I are eager to see the positive impact they will have on our community.

Eswatini experiences erratic rainfall, recurrent droughts, and soil degradation, which can adversely impact food security. In addition to responding to urgent humanitarian needs, USAID supports interventions to build the capacity of people in Eswatini to withstand disasters. For example, USAID has supported programs to help mitigate the impacts of climate shocks by improving access to water and promoting conservation agriculture methods and holistic grazing land management.","Drought conditions negatively affect the ability of people in Swaziland to meet their daily food and water needs.

Steve England and Jake Helminiak of the USACE Philadelphia District traveled to the Kingdom of Eswatini (formerly Swaziland) to participate in workshops, field visits, and to share their expertise with government officials.

The mission, requested by the United States Africa Command (USAFRICOM), is designed to improve water security for the African nation. During drought conditions, the country has challenges in providing water to 100 percent of the population.

“Ultimately, they are trying to become proactive in how they manage water,” said Helminiak. “I think the Eswatini officials appreciated working with people with similar areas of expertise. And from a personal standpoint, this was a great opportunity.”

John Heaton, liaison to USAFRICOM for the USACE North Atlantic Division, participated in the visit and helped organize the mission. USACE plans to provide support in three phases. The first phase, completed in mid-March, involved meeting with officials, participating in site visits, collecting information, and identifying data gaps.

The second phase will involve building a conceptual model to document the country’s ‘water budget’ and the third phase will entail developing numerical models that will be used to help decision-makers and inform an overall water security strategy.

“During the visit, we got a better understanding of their challenges and needs and developed a path forward,” said England. “We plan to have periodic follow up discussions to identify key issues moving forward.”

During the visit, the group met with hydrologists and field technicians from the Department of Water Affairs. They visited multiple dams, gaging stations, and a local agricultural water impoundment.

On a macro level, England and Helminiak are looking at how much water flows into the country through South African rivers; how much water flows out into Mozambique and South Africa; and are considering rainfall patterns and existing groundwater reserves.

As the mission moves forward, they will be working with their Eswatini counterparts to improve data collection, evaluate surface and groundwater resources, and work towards the development of a conceptual model of the Eswatini water resources. They will conduct training on various numerical models and make recommendations for a master planning strategy for sustainable water resource development.

England and Helminiak said the brief visit was interesting from a cultural standpoint. They flew to Johannesburg in South Africa and drove five hours to Eswatini. Helminiak said they saw densely populated urban environments as well as rural areas.

England has previously supported similar missions to share groundwater knowledge and expertise in Cambodia, Mongolia, Afghanistan and Vietnam.","Two USACE hydraulic engineers traveled to Africa in mid-March to share their expertise on a variety of groundwater-related issues.

Villagers from the Sekhukhune district municipality have been fighting for adequate water since 2015. They are now calling for the arrest of the acting municipal manager, Molatelo Mabitsela.

But she says the court application is a “deliberate attempt to embarrass the municipality”.

Tuesday’s court battle in Pretoria, adjudicated on papers without an oral hearing, was the latest in a saga that has spanned half a decade.

The situation has been exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic. Without water, residents cannot wash their hands to reduce transmission of viral or bacterial diseases.

Ariella Scher, an attorney at the Centre for Applied Legal Studies, says the Sekhukhune district municipality continues to violate a 2017 court order obliging it to deliver water to villagers while it seeks a permanent solution to the water problems.

But the water supply in the five villages — Elandskraal, Morarela, Mbuzini, Dichoeng and Tsantsabela — continues to be “intermittent at best”, she says.

Water storage tanks are filled once a week and stand empty most of the time because the water is used up almost immediately, Scher says in an affidavit.

“It is due to the protracted history of this matter and the continued violation of not only the applicants’ constitutional right to access to water, but also the existing court orders that the applicants are forced to approach this court yet again for urgent relief,” the affidavit reads.

“The dire situation in which the applicants find themselves has become exacerbated and even more pressing due to the outbreak of the novel coronavirus, Covid-19.”

Lepelle Northern Water was contracted by the municipality to construct a new water treatment plant, which was expected to have been completed earlier this year.

In May, the minister of human settlements, water and sanitation, Lindiwe Sisulu, placed Lepelle Northern under administration amid a Special Investigating Unit probe into allegations of fraud and maladministration at the state-owned entity charged with supplying bulk potable water in Limpopo.

The Sekhukhune district municipality is no stranger to controversy. Its previous municipal manager, Norah Maseko, was suspended last year over an irregular contract for a R67-million sanitation project.

Mabitsela is the second acting municipal manager since Maseko’s departure.

In her affidavit, Mabitsela says the court application has “nothing to do with the applicants’ right to water”. She accuses the Centre for Applied Legal Studies of using the plight of the poor people to embarrass the municipality and contends that the legal centre has failed to show how her arrest would ensure strict compliance with the court order.

She does not dispute that the 2017 court order “has not been fully complied with”. She says this failure to fully comply was not an act of bad faith.

“Neither my predecessor nor I intended to behave contemptuously towards this court and disrespect the court. We accept that court orders must be complied with and this is without exception,” the affidavit reads. “We also accept that municipalities have a constitutional obligation to provide basic water to all persons. We do not intend to shirk this responsibility.”

Mabitsela denies that the supply of water has been intermittent.

In her response to Mabitsela, Scher refutes this, saying that the villagers remain without a sufficient and reliable water supply. “The applicants’ constitutional rights to dignity and equality as well as their lives and well-being are imperilled by this denial.”","They are now calling for the arrest of the acting municipal manager, Molatelo Mabitsela.

Its objective is to contribute to food security, poverty reduction and climate change resilience by supporting the development of water and irrigation infrastructure in Eswatini.

Within this framework, the AfDB support will enable feasibility studies to be carried out for several water reservoirs, notably that of Mahamba Gorge. Geographically, Mahamba Gorge is a deep cleft in the rocky ridge, dotted with aloe, where the Mkondvo River crosses the mountainous border with South Africa. The AfDB financing will also help launch feasibility studies for the construction of the Ethemba Dam.

The Mahamba Gorge and Ethemba dams will be located on the Mkhondvo River. The water contained in the basin of the two future dams will be transferred to the Ngwavuma River. The US$ 1.67 million provided by the AfDB will also help finance feasibility studies for the construction of the Mpakeni Dam on the Ngwavuma River for the irrigation of downstream areas.

According to the AfDB, its financial support will also be used to prepare detailed designs and tender documents for the new dams to be built at Mahamba Gorge, Ethemba and Mpakeni as well as to implement the water supply system in downstream irrigation areas. It will also help mobilize resources for the construction of the dams and water supply system through a conference of investors.

The Mkondvo-Ngwavuma Water Resources Enhancement Program is part of the Eswatini National Water Resources Management Master Plan. Launched in 2016, the plan has identified potential sites for dams, including the Mpakeni Dam on the Ngwavuma River and the Mahamba Gorge Dam on the Mkhondvo River.

“The aim is to improve agricultural production and productivity by increasing the area under irrigation in these river basins. However, since the land along the Mkhnodvo River is small and unsuitable, the only way to achieve this objective is to transfer water from the Mkhnodvo River to areas downstream of the Ngwavuma River,” says the African Development Bank.

By NATHALIE NDONGO-SEH | 2019-11-22

According to the 2019 United Nations World Water Development Report, improved water resource management and access to safe water and sanitation for all is essential for eradicating poverty, building peaceful and prosperous societies and ensuring that no one is left behind on the path towards sustainable development.

Clean, accessible water for all is an essential part of the world we want to live in.

Access to water, sanitation and hygiene is a human right and there is sufficient fresh water on the planet for all. Yet billions of people are still faced with daily challenges to access clean water and basic sanitation.

water

The demand for water has outpaced the population growth, and half the world’s population is experiencing severe water scarcity at least one month a year.

three in 10 people worldwide lack access to safely managed drinking water services. About three billion people lack access to basic sanitation services such as toilets or latrines.

Millions of people, including children, die every year from diseases associated with inadequate water supply, sanitation and hygiene.Worldwide, more than two million people die every year from diarrhoeal diseases. Poor hygiene and unsafe water are responsible for nearly 90 per cent of these deaths and mostly affect children.1,000 children die every day due to preventable water and sanitation-related diarrheal diseases.

More than 80 per cent of wastewater resulting from human activities is discharged into rivers or sea without any treatment, leading to pollution. Water scarcity, poor water quality and inadequate sanitation negatively impact food security, livelihood choices and educational opportunities for poor families across the world. At the current time, more than two billion people are living with the risk of reduced access to freshwater resources and, by 2050, at least one in four people is likely to live in a country affected by chronic or recurring shortages of fresh water. Drought afflicts some of the world’s poorest countries, worsening hunger and malnutrition.

According to the 2019 United Nations World Water Development Report, titled Leaving No one Behind, water use has been increasing worldwide by about one per cent per year since the 1980s, driven by a combination of population growth, socio-economic development and changing consumption patterns.

This means that stress levels will continue to increase, as the demand for water grows and the effects of climate change intensify.

Fortunately, there has been great progress made in the past decade regarding drinking sources and sanitation, whereby over 90 per cent of the world’s population now has access to improved sources of drinking water. Between 1990 and 2015, the proportion of the global population using an improved drinking water source has increased from 76 per cent to 90 per cent

However, water scarcity affects more than 40 per cent of the global population and is projected to rise.To improve sanitation and access to drinking water, there needs to be increased investment in management of freshwater ecosystems and sanitation facilities on a local level in several developing countries.

Continued prioritisation of water and sanitation as a basic social service, especially to the most vulnerable, has the potential to reverse the scourge of poverty and contribute to national development.

As Eswatini has set a target of 100 per cent access to water and sanitation, the country continues to make progress towards achieving SGD 6 targets by 2030, including through the setting up of an enabling environment. Water stressed populations are found mainly in rural communities where over 61per cent people have access to safe water supply and 46 per cent have access to improved sanitation. In urban areas, 95 per cent have access to water supply and 94 per cent have access to sanitation. As diarrhoea is one of the top 10 causes of under five mortality among children, together -authorities, communities, parents, schools, custodians, and partners alike – we shall ensure that every Emaswati has access to clean water, drinking water, as well as basic sanitation and hygiene, thereby resulting into a significant drop of diarrhoea and risk of diseases outbreaks. The government shall be lauded for its efforts to invest in water infrastructure. Indeed, the country has invested in bulk water transfers across river basins to bring safe water to water stressed and vulnerable communities. Sanitation subsidies and advocacy forcommunity participation have seen the most vulnerable households access basic sanitation services, a key national deliverable in line with Eswatini National Development Strategy.

Early this month, the ministry of natural resources and energy launched the National Water Policy, which will introduce water reforms to promote the development and the review of compliance frameworks that encourage the proper use of water in Eswatini. Key objectives of the policy include the promotion of integrated planning, the development and the management of water resources with a particular emphasis on the roles and responsibilities of stakeholders.

Access to clean water and sanitation is not only a basic need but a foundation for good health and economic development. A healthy and productive population is key to reducing work force down time, school absence and medical expenses due to diarrhoeal diseases. All these have a positive economic impact.

The United Nations Development System in Eswatini remains committed to working with the government and stakeholders to ensure that key development aspects are pointedly addressed in water resources management and access to water supply and sanitation services.In 2016, during the El Nino drought, the United Nations Development System in Eswatini mobilised resources to ensure a coordinated response to maximise existing resources.

Funds

Among the eight United Nations Agencies, funds and programmes present in the country, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) has supported the government through capacity development for the rehabilitation and the management of wetlands to protect critical freshwater sources.

Under the Climate Smart Agriculture project, a study was supported to enable Eswatini to optimise groundwater use in line with the Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) Framework and General Water Sector Reforms. UNDP also supported the improved management of water sources, including water shed protection for more efficient irrigation infrastructure. Within the UN family in Eswatini, the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) rehabilitated and constructed water systems, including rainwater harvesting systems in over 80 schools during the El Nino episode.UNICEF also supported the development of the Sanitation and Hygiene Strategy, which leveraged funding for development partners to assist the government in developing the policy, in addition to supporting a Water Sanitation and Hygiene Financing study to identify possible funding sources towards achieving equitable access to Water Supply and Sanitation services.

For its part, the United Nations World Health Organisation (WHO) supported the government in submittingthe country chapter in the Global Analysis and Assessment of Sanitation and Drinking-Water (GLAAS) Report 2018.

In order to sustain the gains made and improve access to water and sanitation, coordination mechanisms shall be improved;locally available resources shall be used efficiently;research into the conjunctive use of groundwater and hygiene behaviour change shall be addressed; and partnerships shall be strengthened.

The economic impact of not investing in water and sanitation costs 4.3 per cent of sub-Saharan African GDP.

Without better water infrastructure and management, there will be losses in lives, biodiversity and ecosystem resilience, undermining prosperity and efforts towards a more sustainable future. Decision-makers, the private sector, civil society, communities, citizens, academia, labs, start-ups and partners shall join hands: no contribution to the advancement and the attainment of the SDGs in this decade of action and acceleration is too small.

By Sabelo Majola | 2019-02-27

GOVERNMENT has invested about E800 million to mitigate the high demand of water along the Matsapha-Manzini corridor and surrounding areas.

The Eswatini Water Services Corporation (EWSC) is utilising the funding in upgrading the Matsapha Water Treatment Plant to increase capacity to meet future demand this coming financial year.

This was revealed by the Corporation Managing Director Jabulile Mashwama during a press briefing at the EWSC headquarters in Ezulwini yesterday.

She said the upgrade would tie with the larger recently approved Manzini integrated water and sanitation project which will ensure that water is supplied to additional areas under Mafutseni, Nhlambeni, Manzini South and Mtfongwaneni constituencies.

This is one of the four phased approaches aimed at ending the high demand water supply along the country’s economic activity hub which has been a thorn in the flesh for both the business industry and the residents.

“In response to the growing demand for water supply and services in and around the Matsapha-Manzini corridor, the EWSC is implementing short to long term interventions that aim to resolve the constraints experienced by these areas. Implementation of the plan will ensure that the Corporation is able to meet the demand and address the customer complaints which have been shared with the Corporation. The Corporation has done a comprehensive analysis of the constraints and subsequently developed a four-phased approach to put the matter to bed once and for all,” she said.

Mashwama said implementing the short to medium term works would require planned water supply interruptions and the usual 48 hour notice will be given to customers before the scheduled shutdown. She said the planned shutdown schedule for the month of March is on the 9th and 23rd.

“The Corporation will endeavour to minimise the impact of water supply interruption and where required will provide alternative water supply through stationery tanks in strategic places,” she added.

The four phased water approach:

To address the immediate water supply challenges in Tubungu, Police Academy, Emhlane and surrounding areas, the Corporation will integrate its network systems to ensure that the drop in reservoir levels does not affect supply to these areas. This mitigation measure will be implemented in the late evening on Saturday March 3, 2019. To address water supply challenges in Nhlambeni, Masundvwini, Sigombeni and Mobeni, the Corporation is already implementing a mid-term to permanent solution by increasing storage capacity. The placement of a 3 mega litre reservoir at Emathangeni in Matsapha will be completed by the end of May, 2019. This tank will be a dedicated alternate supply point for the Corporation’s residential customers in cases where industrial water supply demand is at its peak. To improve water supply at Kwaluseni, Mfabantfu and surrounding areas the Corporation will increase supply capacity by upgrading the pumping system to the Logoba reservoir. This project will be completed by end of April, 2019

Girls and women are particularly affected by poor WASH conditions. The drudgery of hauling water leads to loss of productivity and leisure time and the lack of toilets negatively impacts their dignity.

Zambia’s high rate of child stunting (35 per cent) is in part a result of poor sanitation — research indicates that adequate sanitation can decrease the risk of stunting. In Zambian schools, lack of access to adequate water supply, sanitation and washing facilities negatively affects students and contributes to high dropout rates, especially among girls. With separate toilets for girls and boys, and privacy for menstrual hygiene management, girls are more likely to remain in school, delay pregnancy and marriage, and have stronger employment opportunities.

Many of these challenges can be overcome through low-cost, high-impact WASH interventions, which promote hygiene and sanitation in the most vulnerable communities.

The two-year project will benefit an estimated 105,000 people in Zambian host communities and 45,000 refugees in five provinces of Zambia: North Western, Western, Northern, Luapula and Lusaka. It was launched on 25 June 2019 with the commissioning of a solar-powered water system and water storage tanks in Mantapala Refugee Settlement, with the presence of the Commissioner for Refugees, the Ambassador of the Federal Republic of Germany, and the Representatives of both UNICEF and UNHCR.

“This funding is crucial because it will increase access to water and minimise the burden currently being faced due to inadequate coverage of water, sanitation and hygiene services within the refugee settlements and hosting areas,” said Hon. Dr. Dennis Wanchinga, MP, Minister of Water Development, Sanitation and Environmental Protection. “This programme takes the right approach in targeting Zambian host communities as well as refugees so that everyone can benefit from improved water and sanitation.”

The programme aims to reduce incidences of water-borne diseases caused by a lack of adequate water supply and sanitation facilities and reduce the burden of water collection on women and girls.

“Zambia has a long tradition of welcoming refugees into the country on a political as well as civil level,” said His Excellency, Mr Achim Burkart, Ambassador of the Federal Republic of Germany. “I am particularly impressed with the support offered by the host communities. Through this 10 million EUR (136 million ZMK) water and sanitation project as well as its humanitarian aid, Germany is committed to support refugees in the settlement as well as the local population in host communities.”

The project will be implemented through UNICEF Zambia in collaboration with the MWDSEP and working closely with the Office of the Commissioner for Refugees, UNHCR, NGOs and private sector contractors.

“The really important part of this programme is that it includes the host community, who stand in the frontline to receive refugees from DR Congo,” said the Commissioner for Refugees, Mr. Abdon L. Mawere. “This approach will contribute to social cohesion and peaceful co-existence. Our cooperating partners are assisting us in a very big way to help us continue to be a place of shelter for those in need.”

“Improved water, sanitation and hygiene services will lead to tangible benefits not just for the health of young children, for whom diarrheal diseases are one of the main cause of malnutrition, childhood illnesses and death, but also improve school performance, gender equality and sustainable development,” said UNICEF Zambia Representative, Ms. Noala Skinner. “This significant investment from the Government of Germany will have a big impact on improving the lives of vulnerable children in refugee hosting locations in Zambia.”

The UNHCR Representative to Zambia, Ms. Pierrine Aylara, said: “UNHCR appreciate the great donation and values the legendary generosity of the people of Germany for supporting refugee programmes across the world including in Zambia.”

Working closely with UNHCR, the interventions will focus on communities in and around Maheba Settlement (Kalumbila), Mayukwayukwa Settlement (Kaoma), Kenani Transit Centre (Nchelenge), Mantapala Settlement (Nchelenge) and Lusaka (Makeni Transit Centre) and reception centres at the border entry points including Chienge (Luapula Province), and Kaputa, Nsumbu and Mpulungu in Northern Province.

The programme is in line with the special initiative “Tackling the root causes of displacement, reintegrating refugees” of the German Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development, the Zambian Seventh National Development Plan, the DRC Regional Refugee Response Plan, the Government of Zambia’s Vision 2030, the National Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Programme (NRWSSP) 2016-2030 and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

Currently, there are 79,688 refugees in Zambia of various nationalities. These statistics include some 23,705 former refugees from Angola and Rwanda whose refugee status ceased in 2012 and 2013, and who have been granted social integration in Zambia, as well as 46,402 refugees from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) who have found international protection in Zambia for decades. The statistics for the DRC refugees include over 20,000 people – 51 per cent women and girls and 58 per cent children, who have arrived in Zambia since August 2017 following deterioration in the security situation in the DRC.","The two-year project will benefit an estimated 105,000 people in Zambian host communities and 45,000 refugees in five provinces of Zambia: North Western, Western, Northern, Luapula and Lusaka.

418,https://globalpressjournal.com/africa/zambia/theres-money-clean-water-zambia-little-changed/,"There’s More Money for Clean Water in Zambia, but Little Has Changed","LUSAKA, ZAMBIA — Agness Mwale wakes up early, before her neighbors, to get water from the well they share. That water is used for washing, bathing and general cleaning, she says.

Later, she makes a trip to a communal tap, where she pays 0.5 Zambian kwacha (about 4 cents) for a 20-liter container of water, which she uses for drinking and cooking.

“I can’t afford to get all my water from the tap,” Mwale says. “It’s expensive.”

The Zambian government has allocated huge sums of money to improve sanitation and access to water across the country, but many say they still struggle to get what they need. According to WaterAid, an organization that works to provide clean water across the globe, the Zambian government releases less than half of the resources budgeted for water-supply and sanitation programs. Government officials say money meant for those programs is diverted to other critical sectors, including health and education.

In 2015, just 31 percent of Zambia’s 15.4 million people had basic sanitation services, according to UNICEF, the United Nations’ child-advocacy agency, and the most recent population statistics available.

Prudence Phiri, GPJ Zambia Royce Chansa uses well water for washing clothes and other household tasks. Well water isn’t clean, she says, but she and her family members drink it when they don’t have other options.

Lack of access to clean water and sanitation became part of the national conversation again between October 2017 and May 2018, when about 5,900 people contracted cholera – mostly in Lusaka, the capital, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a U.S. government agency. An estimated 114 people died.

In 2017, the government allocated 391 million kwacha ($32.7 million) to water supply and sanitation services, up from 283 million kwacha ($23.7 million) in 2016. The budget for that sector grew again in 2018, up to 564 million kwacha ($47.2 million). The 2019 budget includes 1.98 billion kwacha ($165.8 million) for water supply and sanitation. The total budget for the year is 86.8 billion kwacha ($7.2 billion).

Yet, in a trend going back nearly a decade, less than half of that money is spent each year on those services, says Pamela Chisanga, the WaterAid country director in Zambia. It’s not clear why the government holds back so much of the allocated money, she says.

“Water is a key sector that needs a 100 percent release of funds,” Chisanga says. “We can avoid calamities such as cholera if people have access to clean and safe water.”

I can’t afford to get all my water from the tap. It’s expensive.

Dennis Wanchinga, the minister of Water Development, Sanitation and Environmental Protection, doesn’t dispute that much of the money allocated for water supply and sanitation is spent elsewhere, but he notes that it’s not being wasted.

“That money is channeled to other pressing needs in other key sectors, such as education and health,” he says. “We have to compete for resources.”

He says his ministry will lobby the Ministry of Finance to receive the full water-supply and sanitation allocation in 2019.

While Wanchinga pushes for more money, some Zambians say they struggle to meet basic needs.

Mwale, the woman who pays for water at a community tap, says she sometimes can’t afford even that. On those days, she says, her family drinks from the neighborhood well, which she’s not convinced is clean.

Mary Phiri, another Zambian who faces daily water problems, knows how dangerous the consequences of water scarcity can be. Two years ago, she says, her daughter contracted cholera. She survived, but it’s no easier today to get clean water.

“Sometimes children would drink water from the well meant for washing dishes, because to them, water is water, whether from the well or from the tap,” Phiri says.

Zambia's economy has been one of the world's fastest-growing in recent years, but despite this strong growth, 3 out of 4 Zambians still live in extreme poverty. The country faces major challenges: high unemployment and underemployment, low agricultural productivity, inadequate infrastructure, poor educational outcomes, and the impact of HIV and AIDS.

In 2015 the economy took a hit with the substantial decrease in the price of copper, the country's main export. As a result, people began migrating from Copperbelt towns back to their homes in rural areas, which put pressure on insufficient existing water supply systems, and increased the demand for safe water.

Rainfall in Zambia has declined significantly over the last 30 years, and although the country has large fresh water resources, these are currently not used by the large majority of water supply systems.

What We Do in Zambia

In Zambia we work with communities and schools in the Luansobe/Kashitu Copperbelt region, and in the area around Kalomo, to install drilled wells and latrines, and provide hygiene training.

Community members form WASH committees, who decide on their preferred location for the drilled well's pump, and are responsible for maintaining the drilled wells after their completion. The WASH committees are given pump maintenance training and are versed in book-keeping; as committee members contribute money to pay for future repairs. This encourages community ownership.

In Zambia we also work with schools to provide drilled wells, school latrines and hygiene training. The drilled well is located with community preference, and latrines are built with urinals for boys and washrooms for girls. Handwashing stations are constructed and pupils are given hygiene training. A maintenance committee of teachers and parents are trained to maintain both the drilled wells and the latrines.

Caritas is appealing for Euro 745,000 to support communities as they cope with the impact of the drought and help them build resilience against future climate crises.

“Caritas Zambia has been responding to the devastating effects of the drought by providing food to the affected communities,” says Musamba Mubanga, Livelihoods and Climate Change Adaptation programme specialist from Caritas Zambia. “We have also focused on providing solutions to water shortages in some areas. Furthermore, through the current emergency programme Caritas Zambia will help affected communities address food insecurity and also focus on building their resilience to further droughts.”

Not enough rain in the 2018-2019 period means that wells have dried up; families’ maize stores are empty and livestock have died in the south of the country.

Many families can’t even afford to eat one meal a day, crime has increased in affected areas and prices have also increased. Children are deeply affected as they either drop out of school to go and sell food for their families or they have poor concentration at school due to hunger. The lack of water has a triple effect on agriculture, health and nutrition.

Through its emergency programme, Caritas will provide cash transfers so vulnerable people can buy the food they need. It will help establish village loan and savings groups so people can still afford food as prices rise. It will also help create activities where people can earn money.

Part of the year-long programme will be dedicated to boosting the nutrition of underweight children and ensuring communities understand the importance of good nutrition, especially in the young.

Nine thousand households will benefit from gardening activities, receiving training in making their crops more resilient, and they will receive drought-resilient and early-maturing seeds.

Making agricultural practices more robust in the face of climate threats is essential as 60 percent of the Zambian population rely on agriculture for their livelihood.

Livestock has been diminished not just because of the lack of pasture and water because of the drought but also because of foot and mouth disease, East Coast Fever and Anthrax.","Caritas warns that Zambia is facing one of its worst droughts in decades and 2.3 million people urgently need help.

By Danstan Kaunda

LUSAKA, May 16 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Faced with longer droughts and growing water demand, the Zambian government has introduced fees on groundwater use.

Under a new executive order that came into effect in March, owners of domestic boreholes are for the first time required to pay a one-off fee of 250 kwacha ($25) to have their well licensed.

There will be no monthly or annual fees for domestic water users, but those who consume more than 10,000 litres per day will be charged a commercial fee of 5 kwacha for each additional 30 cubic metres they extract, according to the government-run Water Resource Management Authority (WARMA).

Emmanuel Mumba, a legal counsellor at WARMA, said that the utility has long been concerned about how groundwater and surface water were being managed, and prolonged droughts linked to climate change have made the situation worse.

Population growth and growing water use by farming and industry also are putting pressure on the country's dwindling water resources.

""We are going to be monitoring groundwater use now, because as long as it is not managed well we will run out of it,"" Mumba said in an interview with the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

The utility says that 60-70 percent of water consumed in Zambia comes from groundwater.

WARMA inspectors will install devices to measure water consumption and pollution levels in each borehole visited. Wells found to be leaking will be decommissioned, Mumba said.

The agency already has set up observation boreholes to judge how much groundwater levels are decreasing and to measure water contamination in parts of Lusaka, he said.

The Zambian government has placed water management on its economic and sustainable development agenda in its seventh national development plan, for the period 2017 to 2021, according to the Ministry of Energy and Water Development.

The ministry's permanent secretary, Ed Chomba, said at a press conference that the borehole charges would cover administrative costs and help regulate water use in the face of climate change.

The new rules allow a domestic household to use an average of 10 cubic metres (10,000 litres) of water a day.

Failure to register a borehole can result in a maximum fine of 30,000 kwacha ($3,000) or imprisonment for up to 12 months, according to the new rules.

But an international charity working on water issues in Zambia says more steps need to be taken to regulate consumption and reduce pollution.

Pamela Chisanga of WaterAid Zambia said contamination of water is as big a problem as lack of it in parts of Zambia.

""For us, the challenge is water contamination before we talk of how much water each household can use,"" she said.

Mike Zulu of Lusaka, who owns a borehole, said that when his water was tested it was found to be polluted.

Zulu, who said his household uses considerably less than 5,000 litres of water per day, believes that income from the well licensing programme should be used to address increasing levels of water contamination, rather than simply being spent on administration of the programme.

""It would have been better if the funds raised were used to assist borehole owners to deal with polluted water,"" he said.

FEWER DRILLERS, FEWER WELLS?

Christopher Chilongo, secretary of the Drillers Association of Zambia, said that the new regulations will help set standards for the construction of new boreholes.

Only registered firms with qualified staff are now allow to drill wells.

""Clearly the groundwater table level keeps on dropping, and we cannot keep on (drilling) holes,"" Chilongo said. ""Twenty years from now it will be a huge problem if the issue is not addressed now.""

Chilongo said that according to a survey by his association last year, the temperature of groundwater is rising, while the water level is falling in most parts of the country.

The Zambian government reported in 2015 that 11 percent of urban residents lacked access to safe drinking water, while almost half the rural population lacked access.

""As the means of (conserving) groundwater, we are encouraging communities to use communal boreholes in most residential areas. For example, six to nine households can have one borehole to use,"" Chilongo said.

WARMA officials similarly said they hope most domestic boreholes used by single households will eventually be decommissioned in favour of shared wells.

This will improve conservation of water and also raise funds, since under the new regulations boreholes used by more than one household can be charged commercial rates, WARMA officials said.

424,https://www.afdb.org/en/success-stories/zambia-mine-field-agriculture-project-helps-youth-turn-away-copper-and-live-land-36948,Zambia: From mine to field: agriculture project helps youth turn away from copper and live off the land,"In Zambia’s Serenje district, young Zambians are being offered a ray of hope in the form of an agriculture project that is both an alternative to copper mining as a path out of poverty and a key element of the Zambian government’s strategy to diversify its economy away from a heavy dependence on copper.

Sylvia Chafungwa, a young woman living in Serenje in central Zambia, is a farmer and the treasurer of one of its farmers’ associations. A few months ago, the community’s entire workforce turned to agriculture after Zambia’s economy hit a downturn as a result of a copper price plunge triggered by the global COVID-19 pandemic.

The Agriculture Productivity and Market Enhancement Project (APMEP) program, Chafungwa says, helped her to better cultivate maize, soy and rice on land she inherited from her father. “We realized that agriculture can put food on our table and offer us a sustainable source of income. So we all became farmers,” she said.

The APMEP initiative is financed by the Global Agriculture and Food Security Program (GAFSP), a Financial Intermediary Fund hosted within the World Bank Group. GAFSP provided $31.13 million in grant funds to the Zambian government for APMEP, and the African Development Bank disbursed the money and provided technical expertise.

APMEP is developing irrigation schemes, intensifying agricultural mechanization, promoting conservation agriculture, crop diversification, and enhanced aquaculture and livestock development in Zambia as part of an integrated agriculture value chain development under the Ministry of Agriculture. The project contributes to economic growth and poverty reduction by enhancing food security, incomes, and nutrition among participating households.

The Bank’s Director of Agriculture and Agro-Industry Martin Fregene, said, “GAFSP has provided farmers with ways to improve their livelihoods and created employment, especially for vulnerable people like women and youth in rural areas.”

In Serenje, APMEP is planning construction of four irrigation schemes on more than 2,000 hectares of land. These will provide adequate water for farmers like Chafungwa and her community to carry out conservation agriculture, a farming system that promotes minimum soil disturbance and promotes cultivation of diverse crops throughout the year.

Before the new infrastructure was installed, the project supported rain-fed crop cultivation in the 2018 and 2019 seasons. During this time, APMEP trained farmers in crop management and offered opportunities to earn income by weeding and harvesting the crops. Farmers are now implementing the techniques they learned on their own fields. The farmers’ association in Serenje owns the irrigation scheme and operates it commercially, under the leadership of a scheme manager.

Since the beginning of the program, 62,000 people - about 56% of them women - have benefitted from the project.

“This project is making transformational impact on livelihoods among community members in terms of food security and income. It has really changed people’s mindset on agriculture as a business, especially in the central districts of the project,” said Sylvester Mwanza, APMEP’s National Project Coordinator.

The initiative is part of a longer-term drive by Zambia’s government to diversify its economy away from copper. At its peak, copper accounted for 70% of Zambia’s foreign exchange earnings and close to 30% of government revenue. But following the 2008 global economic crisis, copper prices plunged by two-thirds - prompting the government to invest more in sustainable resources like agriculture.

Bank agricultural specialists assisted the APMEP team with the project implementation and provided tools and technical expertise in best practices and inputs. Philip Boahen, Chief Agriculture Policy Economist at the Bank and Coordinator of the GAFSP Portfolio, said the training that Chafungwa and her community received have enabled them to build a sustainable agri-business by making the most of improved seeds, fertilizers, irrigation infrastructure and financing.

“It is life changing and I can see all the benefits of this project for me, my family, and the whole community in Serenje,” said Chafungwa, adding that she hopes her association will soon be able to buy more tractors and other farm equipment.

The African Development Bank, as the supervising entity of the GAFSP program in Africa, offers technical support in 12 countries: Liberia, Kenya, Gambia, Senegal, Mali, Benin, Malawi, Niger, Tanzania, Central Africa Republic, Cote d’Ivoire and Zambia, with a total portfolio value of $372.43 million.","Sylvia Chafungwa, a young woman living in Serenje in central Zambia, is a farmer and the treasurer of one of its farmers’ associations.

He is describing the scene along the streets of the capital, Lusaka, where earthmovers and excavators were digging out disused water pipelines from a major trench and replacing them with new and more durable tubes.

The works form part of the $243 million Lusaka Sanitation Program (LSP), funded jointly by the African Development Bank, the European Investment Bank, German Development Bank and the World Bank. The project is being executed under the Lusaka Sanitation Master Plan, which aims to provide citywide sanitation services by 2035 and transform the lives of more than a million Lusaka residents by 2021.

The Lusaka Water and Sewerage Company (LWSC), which is implementing the program, says about 7,000 households in the George, Kanyama and Chawama suburbs of the capital will benefit from improved sanitation. The objective is to increase access to sustainable sanitation services to the city’s two million residents, especially low-income households, and strengthen LWSC’s capacity to manage sanitation services.

“Lusaka is a relatively flat city and suffers from a recurrent sanitation crisis that continues to claim lives through annual outbreaks of cholera, typhoid and dysentery. There is also persistent environmental pollution,” says Chinokoro.

An estimated 70% of Lusaka’s residents live in peri-urban areas, which are relatively high density, unplanned neighborhoods, largely comprising lower-income residents. About 90% of these townships rely on substandard pit latrines which pose health hazards to the communities. Others use sewers, septic tanks or defecate in the open.

Chinokoro says 57% of Lusaka’s water supply comes from shallow wells, which is prone to contamination from the pit toilets and through fissures in the underlying rocks. “The most vulnerable areas are the low-income neighborhoods, making sewerage an attractive sanitation option. Poor management of solid waste and storm water drainage further compound these problems,” he says.

LWSC sanitation engineer Mwansa Nachula says the sanitation program will improve sanitation facilities and prevent water-borne diseases. “Pit latrines in Lusaka are actually occupying more space than water points and there are a lot of shallow wells and dugouts sited very close to the pit latrines, which makes for easy contamination of the water,” she says.

The sewerage work is only the more visible part of an intense and person-to-person sanitation campaign in the townships. The aim is to protect the groundwater from contamination by building improved toilets with fully lined substructures that prevent leakage of waste. “These structures include seat or squat toilets, super structure with customers’ choice of brick or block; render and paint, door and door latch, among other options,” says Nachula.

In a sprawling township called George Compound, which has the new toilet structures dotted across it, Clara Malumba shows off her new facility, erected steps away from her door and a water standpipe. “There is no whiff here. The pit is lined with cement and plastic, so it does not leech into the groundwater. My kids love it,” says Malumba.

Another resident, Ruth Phiri, is also proud of her new toilet, which she shares with a neighboring household, which is yet to build its own. Both toilets are beautifully painted. A Bank-funded program trains men and women from this community to design and build these structures as a full-time business, thereby providing jobs to the local people.

“It is in these compounds that the battle for improved sanitation in Lusaka will be won or lost, and we seem to be winning,” says Chinokoro. “The first hurdle is getting the ordinary people to see their interest in what you are proposing, and we seem to have achieved that goal. Now they will respond more to pressure from neighbors,” he says.","The works form part of the $243 million Lusaka Sanitation Program (LSP), funded jointly by the African Development Bank, the European Investment Bank, German Development Bank and the World Bank.

The Integrated Small Towns Water Supply and Sanitation Program aims to increase access to quality water supply and sanitation services in a sustainable manner in 12 towns located in four provinces of Zambia. Other objectives include ensuring efficient management and operation of the water supply and sewerage facilities on free market principles.

Zambia’s small towns are experiencing rapid growth requiring rehabilitation and expansion of the water and sanitation infrastructure to support businesses and further create a favourable environment for the growth of industries and small businesses. By providing improved infrastructure, this program will specifically boost economic development in the target areas.

Specifically, this intervention will construct and rehabilitate climate-resilient water and sanitation infrastructure, including expansion into peri-urban and low-cost settlements. It will also build the capacity of water utilities, regulators and train communities involved in the program, including creating economic opportunities for women and youth.

The Bank’s intervention is expected to improve the health conditions of one million residents through increased access to safe and reliable drinking water and improved sanitation services. Also, about 5,000 new jobs will be created during and after the implementation of the program.

The program is aligned to the Zambia’s National Vision 2030 and the Revised Sixth National Development Plan (R-SNDP: 2013-2016). Water is not only central to both strategies, but also considered as a key sector for the growth of the economy.

The Integrated Small Towns Water Supply and Sanitation Program will further enable the AfDB to achieve its fifth High 5s strategic priority to “Improve the quality of life for the people of Africa”.

The program is scheduled to be implemented in 48 months at a total cost of US $150.57 million. The Bank’s loans and grants will cover 80% of the costs.

The AWF €1.4-million grant to finance a set of studies facilitating the upscaling of the USI project will contribute to better livelihood conditions, job creation and climate change resilience of smallholder farmers in the country.

Climate Change Challenges Smallholder Farming. The Zambian smallholder farming community is highly vulnerable to the impacts of global warming and climate change. This situation poses significant challenges towards attaining water security, sustaining crop productivity, maintaining economic growth and improving livelihoods. Rain-fed subsistence agriculture, widely practised in Zambia, is increasingly under pressure from erratic rainfall patterns, and has failed to significantly raise crop productivity, or to lessen the impact of seasonal cycles of hunger and food insecurity. Agricultural production in Zambia is dominated by small-scale farmers, even though the country has a relatively strong commercial sector in comparison to other countries in the region. An estimated 600,000 smallholder farmers produce most of the country’s cassava, cotton, millet and sorghum, as well as over 90% of its maize. Yet, current production systems in the majority of cases are highly vulnerable to fluctuations in rainfall.

AWF Response to Underdeveloped Irrigation. While Zambia has abundant arable land, only 14% of land suitable for agricultural production is being cultivated. At the same time, despite its great potential for irrigation in the country, less than 30% of the land suitable for irrigation has been developed. Importantly, most of the irrigated area in Zambia services large-scale commercial farming enterprises, while smallholder farmers are yet to benefit from significant investments in the sector. The AWF Upscaling Smallholder Irrigation project, with a total cost of €1.6 million (of which AWF contributed €1.4 million and the Government of Zambia €200,000), will include feasibility studies (technical, market, economic and financial analysis) available to the Government to make informed investment decisions to boost irrigation coverage of the country. “The project will identify and prepare potential irrigation investments in 25 sites leading to the opening of an additional 9,560 hectares of irrigated land for 4,800 smallholder households,” said Mohamed El Azizi, Director of AWF and the African Development Bank’s (AfDB) Water and Sanitation Department.

AfDB drives the Feed Africa Strategy. The project is embedded in the newly launched Feed Africa Strategy developed as part of Africa Development Bank’s High 5 Initiative. The project will add value to the Agricultural Commodity Corridors to be identified and developed by Zambia as part of the Feed Africa Strategy. The project is aligned with Zambia’s Seventh National Development Plan.

Optimizing the project implementation for better results. On November 9, 2016, the main stakeholders of the USI project, including representatives from Zambia’s Ministry of Agriculture, the project’s executive agency, and other selected Ministries, and from the AfDB, gathered in Lusaka for a launch workshop to ensure an efficient and smooth implementation of the project.","The African Water Facility (AWF) held a one-day event on November 9, 2016 to launch the Upscaling Smallholder Irrigation (USI) project, which aims to help develop smallholder irrigation in Zambia.

A cheerful, energetic 34-year-old single mother of two, she is using her considerable powers of persuasion to help local communities achieve a low cost, high impact project in the region: getting her neighbors to build decent latrines. Thus far, she has persuaded 48 out of the 55 households in her village to build the improved toilets.

“Open defecation used to be so common,”

says Herbert Chinokoro, the Senior Water and Sanitation Engineer, in the Bank’s Country Office in Zambia, in Matomola’s village of Busitakulo in Sesheke District.

Matomola and her 565 peers, commonly known as “Community Champions, “ are the bedrock of the Transforming Rural Livelihoods in Western Zambia project – and they are determined to ensure that the project’s impact lives up to its name. The construction of these sanitation facilities by individual households is part of what the project calls Community Led Total Sanitation. The project seeks to promote open defecation-free communities, improved household sanitation through marketing, improved hygiene practices, and public sanitation facilities for 830 schools, 16 markets and 70 health centers.

The US$34 million program, of which the Bank-hosted Rural Water and Sanitation Initiative Trust Fund provided US$4.1 million in grant funds, aims to provide sustainable and equitable access to improved water supply and improved sanitation to meet basic needs for improved health and poverty alleviation for Zambia’s rural population in Western Province. The program covers education, income generation, women’s empowerment and supports communities to better prepare for and respond to climate change and other environmental conditions.

The main expected outputs include providing some 745,176 people with access to improved water supply within 500 meters of their homes; targeting more than 431,000 people in 16 districts to stop open defecation; sensitizing nearly 600,000 people through hygiene education and providing more than 83,000 adults and pupils with 900 sanitation units in schools, health centers and markets.



A twine basket prevents the brittle walls of the pit latrines from collapsing



The sandy, brittle soil of western Zambia is not suitable for traditional pit latrines, which tend to collapse after only a few weeks of use. Project organizers adapted a biodegradable, two-meter-long stick and twine -woven basket that is then inserted into the pit before it is covered with a slab. The basket’s semi-hard structure keeps the unstable walls of the pit from collapsing. This type of toilet typically lasts a couple of years, depending on frequency of usage, before it is closed and a new one built. This is in contrast to the traditional ones that sometimes lasted only a couple of weeks.

Improved toilets make for better sanitation with tippy taps, a handwashing device consisting of a plastic can hung on a cross stick that tips over and dispenses soapy water when the user steps on its pulley.

In the village of Koba, near the provincial capital, Mongu, Village Chief Samson Mandweni wants to take visitors to every household toilet so that each household has an improved latrine. “We have defeated dysentery, we have killed diarrhea, we have no cholera,” he says.

Figures from the project’s Provincial Support Team show that there has been a sharp drop in the incidence of these water-borne diseases in the 16 districts where the program is implemented. Bank Chinokoro says that the improved toilets save the villagers the cost of treatment for these diseases, which leads to more children attending school because they are less ill, and adults doing more work because they are healthier, leading to improved harvests and better incomes.

“It is a low cost project, but its impact is really transformational,” he says. He says the behavior change that the program has brought to these rural communities is likely to last for their lifetimes.

Tumba Mupango, the government Community Development Expert in the Provincial Support Team, worries that people are still building toilets too far away from their houses. “The aspect of safety, especially at night time, and the idea that they can build a toilet right inside their enclosures has not quite caught on yet,” she says.

Matomola says the champions, the majority of whom are women volunteers, are working to get the toilets built closer to homes. For Chinokoro, the champions are his not-so-secret weapon for the success of the sanitation program, which is ahead of schedule.

The project provided the champions with cell phones to send their weekly data on compliance to the provincial team on the open defecation-free status of the villages in real time. Before the rainy season gets going in earnest, on the hills above the floodplain of the great Zambezi River, Chinokoro says that the project intends to supply the champions with gumboots, raincoats, protective wear, flashlights and, to Matomola’s delight, a badge.","Beauty Matomola is one of the champions of the Government’s Transforming Rural Livelihoods in Western Zambia project, financed by the African Development Bank.

Under a new executive order that came into effect in March, owners of domestic boreholes are for the first time required to pay a one-off fee of 250 kwacha ($25) to have their well licensed.

There will be no monthly or annual fees for domestic water users, but those who consume more than 10,000 litres per day will be charged a commercial fee of 5 kwacha for each additional 30 cubic metres they extract, according to the government-run Water Resource Management Authority (WARMA).

Emmanuel Mumba, a legal counsellor at WARMA, said that the utility has long been concerned about how groundwater and surface water were being managed, and prolonged droughts linked to climate change have made the situation worse.

Population growth and growing water use by farming and industry also are putting pressure on the country’s dwindling water resources.

“We are going to be monitoring groundwater use now, because as long as it is not managed well we will run out of it,” Mumba said in an interview with the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

The utility says that 60-70 percent of water consumed in Zambia comes from groundwater.

WARMA inspectors will install devices to measure water consumption and pollution levels in each borehole visited. Wells found to be leaking will be decommissioned, Mumba said.

The agency already has set up observation boreholes to judge how much groundwater levels are decreasing and to measure water contamination in parts of Lusaka, he said.

The Zambian government has placed water management on its economic and sustainable development agenda in its seventh national development plan, for the period 2017 to 2021, according to the Ministry of Energy and Water Development.

The ministry’s permanent secretary, Ed Chomba, said at a press conference that the borehole charges would cover administrative costs and help regulate water use in the face of climate change.

The new rules allow a domestic household to use an average of 10 cubic metres (10,000 litres) of water a day.

Failure to register a borehole can result in a maximum fine of 30,000 kwacha ($3,000) or imprisonment for up to 12 months, according to the new rules.

But an international charity working on water issues in Zambia says more steps need to be taken to regulate consumption and reduce pollution.

Pamela Chisanga of WaterAid Zambia said contamination of water is as big a problem as lack of it in parts of Zambia.

“For us, the challenge is water contamination before we talk of how much water each household can use,” she said.

Mike Zulu of Lusaka, who owns a borehole, said that when his water was tested it was found to be polluted.

Zulu, who said his household uses considerably less than 5,000 litres of water per day, believes that income from the well licensing programme should be used to address increasing levels of water contamination, rather than simply being spent on administration of the programme.

“It would have been better if the funds raised were used to assist borehole owners to deal with polluted water,” he said.

FEWER DRILLERS, FEWER WELLS?

Christopher Chilongo, secretary of the Drillers Association of Zambia, said that the new regulations will help set standards for the construction of new boreholes.

Only registered firms with qualified staff are now allow to drill wells.

“Clearly the groundwater table level keeps on dropping, and we cannot keep on (drilling) holes,” Chilongo said. “Twenty years from now it will be a huge problem if the issue is not addressed now.”

Chilongo said that according to a survey by his association last year, the temperature of groundwater is rising, while the water level is falling in most parts of the country.

The Zambian government reported in 2015 that 11 percent of urban residents lacked access to safe drinking water, while almost half the rural population lacked access.

“As the means of (conserving) groundwater, we are encouraging communities to use communal boreholes in most residential areas. For example, six to nine households can have one borehole to use,” Chilongo said.

WARMA officials similarly said they hope most domestic boreholes used by single households will eventually be decommissioned in favour of shared wells.

This will improve conservation of water and also raise funds, since under the new regulations boreholes used by more than one household can be charged commercial rates, WARMA officials said.

431,https://www.endwaterpoverty.org/news/zambia-ngo-wash-forum-government-directive-water-supply-Covid,Zambia NGO WASH Forum respond to government directive to commercial utilities to maintain water supply during COVID-19 outbreak,"The Zambia NGO WASH Forum is a network of civil society and non-government organisations working on water, sanitation and hygiene. Since its inception in 2007, the Forum’s mandate has been to influence and support improved and sustainable service delivery of water, sanitation and hygiene facilities through advocacy and strengthening civil society participation and coordination.

In November 2019, an acute respiratory disease known as COVID-19 emerged. The pathogen responsible for COVID-19 is severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a member of the coronavirus family. The COVID19 disease that originated in China has since spread to more than 100 countries and already claimed more than 140,000 lives.

Zambia has been identified as one of the top 18 African countries most vulnerable to the fast spreading virus and has recorded 48 confirmed cases and 2 deaths. Good hygiene and safe water are the first line of defence against COVID-19 and other highly contagious diseases yet many Zambians still do not have access to water in their homes, schools or health centres to protect themselves from the spread of disease. While there is no known cure for the virus, the most effective and easiest way to prevent the virus from spreading includes frequent hand washing with soap and water, good hygiene and social distancing.

Statistics show that 64% of Zambia’s population has basic drinking water services while 33% have basic sanitation services. An estimated 10% of the population practice open defecation while 24% of households have access to a handwashing facility with soap and water.

Considerable disparities exist in the coverage of water, sanitation and hygiene services. 87% of people in urban areas have water compared to 49% in rural areas. Similarly, 41% of people access basic sanitation in urban areas compared to 28 per cent in rural areas. About 16% of the rural population practices open defecation compared to 1% in urban areas.

The risks pandemics and other diseases pose can be managed through proper targeting, prioritisation and investment of water, sanitation and hygiene services. It must be noted that over the last 10 years and more, only about 40% of what the government allocated in the national budget to the water sector has been released. With the current outbreak, it is imperative that 100% of the budget is released and repurposed to support the fight against COVID-19, specifically focusing on improving water supply, sanitation and hygiene services.

On 19 March 2020, the Minister of Water Development Sanitation and Environmental Protection, Hon. Dr. Dennis Wanchinga directed Commercial Utilities in the country not to disconnect water services for clients who have not settled their bills to ensure people continue to access water during this difficult time. This move is commendable but more needs to be done to support communities who do not have access to water as well as to ensure commercial utilities are able to sustainably provide water and sanitation services.

The NGO WASH Forum would like to draw attention to the fact that the Commercial Utilities are currently unable to operate at optimal level - providing services using old, dilapidated infrastructure - and unable to extend services to new areas or repair existing networks. While most people's water and sanitation services are supplied by commercial utilities, many communities in peri-urban areas access water through water trusts and community managed facilities who may continue to charge for providing water. This only serves to widen existing inequalities in access to water.

The government suspended excise duty on imported ethanol for use in alcohol-based sanitisers in order to provide relief to businesses manufacturing the product. This is commendable and we request that the government similarly provides relief to commercial utilities to support their operations during the COVID pandemic response. A number of commercial utilities are owed large sums of money in unpaid bills from various government departments. Additionally the tariffs are not cost reflective and thus do not support operation and maintenance costs.

In view of the foregoing, we request Government to;","The Zambia NGO WASH Forum is a network of civil society and non-government organisations working on water, sanitation and hygiene.

This article is more than 8 months old

Zambia is facing severe water and electricity shortages after a lengthy drought, with reservoir levels remaining worryingly low despite recent rains.

Water levels in Lake Kariba, the world’s largest artificial lake at more than 5,500 sq km, have dropped by six metres in the past three years.

In early March, available water for hydroelectric production at the Kariba dam, which spans the border between Zambia and Zimbabwe, was about 11.5%, a slight recovery on the record low in January.

A year earlier, hydro levels at the lake exceeded 42%. When running at capacity, the hydroelectric plant produces more than 2.1GW of electricity.

“People see the recent rainfall and the flooding and wonder why the lake isn’t filling up, but what you have to understand is just how huge it is, and how much water has been lost”, said Patrick Siptela, a design engineer with the Zambezi River Authority.

It is now restricted to about a quarter of capacity, leading to frequent power outages across both countries, with many businesses relying on diesel generators for eight hours a day.

About half of Zambia’s total electrical power comes from the Kariba dam, Siptela said. However, this key source of low-carbon power is susceptible to climate-driven impacts in the region. Records dating to 1960 show a warming trend of 0.34C per decade. This suggests the country has warmed by at least 1.7C in 60 years.

In tandem with this strong warming trend, average rainfall in Zambia has fallen by 2.3% per decade in the same period.

The nature and timing of rainfall is also changing. After months of severe drought, recent torrential downpours have destroyed crops and infrastructure.

“Some of our roads that have stood the test of time for years are now succumbing. We know the conditions are really extreme”, said Carol Mwape Zulu, the chief climate change officer at Zambia’s Ministry of Lands and Natural Resources.

She said climate change could “draw development backwards. It’s not just immediate infrastructure damage – you realise it has an impact on education, on children who can’t access schools. It also impacts health issues, nutrition, food security – and malnutrition is holding back children’s development.”

Zambia was also experiencing rapid deforestation of 276,000 hectares a year, Mwape Zulu said. Many traders sell baskets of charcoal on the roadside, much of it sourced from larger hardwood trees. In urban areas, charcoal is used for cooking because it is cheaper and more reliable than grid electricity.

Some farmers whose crops and livestock have been hard hit by droughts are turning to charcoal production. “We don’t like to cut the trees but we have no choice,” said Diana Moono, a charcoal seller who has five children. “The drought has taken most of our crops, so we have to find some money somehow.”

Alexander Kasenzi, the director of the NGO Harvest Help Zambia said the death of wild animals in Gwembe valley during the recent droughts was unprecedented. “Local people cannot recall a period when even the wildlife was affected,” he said.

Cattle herders abandoned their livestock in the bush and many cows and goats have died from the water shortage. Local women have to queue from 1am each day to access what limited water is available from boreholes.

“I have a strong feeling that what we’re experiencing now has come to stay, and we have to completely change our thinking if we’re to survive. It’s getting tougher and tougher,” Kasenzi said.

In a remote rural part of Siavonga district, Lanson Hannidra, an 80-year-old farmer, recalls a comparable period of severe drought in the 1950s. “When that happened, we used to go looking for food and beg from our less affected neighbours – but this time, they too have nothing.”","Water levels in Lake Kariba, the world’s largest artificial lake at more than 5,500 sq km, have dropped by six metres in the past three years.

They were present in the locality in the north-west of the country for the launch of the Kafulafuta “Water Supply System Project”. Zambia’s President Edgar Lungu personally launched the project, which aims to provide drinking water to 1 million people in several cities in Copperbelt province.

The works will be financed through a loan from China. In his speech, President Edgar Lungu said that the project would cost a total of $449 million. It will be carried out by China National Complete Engineering Corporation. In the coming weeks, the latter will begin construction of the Kafulafuta dam, which can hold 123 million m3 of water. The water will then be pumped by two stations and transported, via a network of pipes to be laid, to four treatment stations.

A construction site and 6,000 jobs in sight

In areas not served by the drinking water distribution network, such as several cities in Copperbelt Province, China National Complete will build pipelines and repair old ones. To successfully develop all these infrastructures, the Chinese company will have to rely on the local workforce. It estimates that the entire project will create 6,000 jobs during the construction phase.

According to the Zambian president, the project demonstrates, “the government’s commitment to provide universal access to safe drinking water for all by 2030, in line with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)”. It will improve access to water and sanitation in Copperbelt province.

“The construction and operation of these projects will help Zambia meet the challenge of inadequate public facilities, raise the level of public health services and provide a strong guarantee for the socio-economic development of this province of Zambia,” said Li Jie, Chinese ambassador, during the launching of the project. As a reminder, in 2015, only 61% of Zambians had access to safe drinking water.

A project implemented by CCEC

The Kafulafuta drinking water project is one of the Zambian government’s major initiatives in the drinking water sector. The project involves building a dam on the Kafulafuta River. The contract was awarded to China National Complete Engineering (CCEC). The dam that the Chinese company is currently building will be able to contain 125 million m3 of water. Its construction, however, caused the displacement of the populations of the Masaiti District in Copperbelt province. Before starting the construction of the dam, CCEC had to rebuild 250 houses, 44 of which belong to people with disabilities.

Two pumping stations will be built in the reservoir. The pumped water will supply four drinking water plants. CCEC will also have to rehabilitate and extend drinking water distribution networks mainly in the districts of Masaiti, Mpongwe, Ndola and Luanshya. A total of one million people are expected to benefit from this project in central Zambia.

The project will require a $450 million investment. The Zambian government is financing the project through a loan from Exim Bank of China, China’s state-owned foreign trade bank.

According to CCEC, lack of funding is the reason for the work suspension. This version is disputed by the authorities, who instead mention meteorological reasons.

A solution to the drinking water crisis in the city...

The launch of this project follows a drinking water crisis that affected this city in Lusaka province in central Zambia. Like many countries in southern and eastern Africa, Zambia has been facing drought for the past five years. It is manifested in particular by the drying up of surface water resources.

In Lusaka province, the level of the Chongwe dam has dropped drastically, causing a shortage of the resource available for the region’s water treatment plant, impacting the water supply to the population.

The problem of drinking water supply in Chongwe has worsened due to the pollution of its river by domestic wastewater. Ngwerere Creek, which is an important water source for the city’s drinking water plant, is exposed to polluting discharges from overloaded wastewater treatment plants in the capital Lusaka, before reaching the Chongwe Dam. These problems are further exacerbated by fraudulent water intakes on the drinking water distribution network in the city.

But a multi-year drought has slowed large sections of the imposing falls to little more than a weak stream, and the lush vegetation they once nourished is hot and dry.

The parched waterfall is perhaps the most visible effect of the drought that is hammering this region. But it is not the most devastating. The World Food Program says that more than 7 million people in Zimbabwe alone are going hungry, with a further 45 million people across southern Africa at risk.

As delegates desperately search for a practical plan for cutting emissions at the COP25 meetings in Madrid, Spain, this week, this region is a stark reminder that the climate crisis is here and now -- and that countries that did the least to cause the climate crisis are already being hit the hardest.

""Our future is still ahead of us,"" said Nkosi Nyathi, a 16-year-old climate activist from Victoria Falls, ahead of his flight to COP25 in Madrid. ""We are looking at what is already happening with the drought. What is our future going to be like? Even just 10 years down the line or 15 years down the line, it will affect us very much.""

Nyathi started campaigning for the environment when he was just 10 years old. He says while he wasn't good at sports, he was good at debating, so he started going into the communities to educate people about renewable energy and climate change.

Nkosi Nyathi in Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe.

His visit to Madrid -- his first trip out of the region -- is part of an initiative by UNICEF to involve more youth voices into the climate debate.

""The voice of the youth needs to be part of the decision-making policies. We have to be aware. You have to be aware. We are all being affected,"" Nyathi said.

But Nyathi knows that the impact from emissions reductions can't come from here in Zimbabwe. It needs to be done in industrial countries.

The whole of Africa contributed around 1% of the historic emissions that caused climate change, according to noted climate expert Francois Engelbrecht, a scientist at the Global Change Institute at the University of the Witwatersrand and lead author on the IPCC climate reports.

The United States bears the biggest historical responsibility for emissions. Despite this, the Trump administration is in the process of pulling out of the landmark Paris climate agreement.

""I think Africans are fully realizing how urgent the need now is for worldwide climate action,"" Engelbrecht says. ""The southern African region, in particular, is already hot and dry and is projected to become even hotter and drier under future climate change. In fact, the region is projected to warm at more or less double the global rate of warming.""

One of those feeling the repercussions of global warming is Felistus Ncube, a subsistence farmer in western Zimbabwe.

Ncube doesn't need climate science to tell her how things have changed in this part of the country. As a child, they could depend on the rains to plant their maize and sorghum, a grain used to feed livestock. But no longer.

Once a proud farmer, Felistus Ncube now stands in line for food aid.

""The rain levels have been falling and they always come late,"" she says as she collects her allotted food aid. Even with the assistance, Ncube and her two grandchildren live off a single meal a day. The children's parents left for South Africa years ago as farming became unrealistic.

Making the drought worse, the Zimbabwean economy is in a tailspin with rising inflation and failed political reform that has left residents living under more brutal conditions than ever before.

When Hilal Elver, the UN Special Rapporteur on the right to food, recently visited the country she called the crisis ""man-made starvation"" caused by government disfunction.

But unlike in wealthy nations, many countries in this region -- and in sub-Saharan Africa as a whole -- do not have the financial or organizational capacity to ready their populations for a changing climate. The Paris agreement factors in this climate response, but policy makers say it isn't enough.

A crowd waits for food aid distribution to begin in Kasibo, Zimbabwe.

And if it isn't enough now, it won't be enough in the future. Climate models show that without substantial and sustained emissions cuts, southern Africa is heading for a tipping point.

""At the current rate, with greenhouse gas concentrations continuing to increase in the atmosphere, the southern African region five decades from now will be unrecognizable compared to the region we are living in today,"" says Englebrecht.

Extreme climate events will come more frequently and on multiple fronts: Sustained droughts and heatwaves will continue; cyclones like Idai that hit Mozambique and Zimbabwe in March will get stronger; and the prospect of Day Zero water events -- like when Cape Town very nearly ran out of water last year -- are three times more likely, Englebrecht says.

Climate models project a nightmare scenario where staple crops such as maize won't survive the heatwaves and even cattle farming -- key to the livelihood of millions -- will be impossible.

And climate experts say younger generations globally will start feeling the disastrous effects of human-driven emissions much like the scenarios now being faced in southern Africa.

Equitable access to clean water is often the first step in holistic community development, providing the foundation for transformative change in health, livelihoods, agriculture and food security. Access to clean water doesn’t only save lives – it keeps children in school, improves education and equality for women, and helps communities to become self-sufficient.

World Vision is the largest non-governmental provider of clean water in the developing world. Every 10 seconds we reach another person with clean water!

In 2017, World Vision partnered with Australian business Aquamate to bring clean water to four remote communities across southern Zambia. Our partnership delivered four 46,800 litre water tanks to communities who had never before had access to a safe and sustainable water supply. With the support of World Vision, the water tanks were installed alongside a network of pipes and pumping systems. They now form a key element of local water supply systems and facilitate equitable access to clean water for households, schools and farmers.

The installation of water tanks and availability of clean water in Zambia is contributing to transformative change in health, water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) and livelihoods. Children now have access to safe water for drinking, families are learning to improve sanitation and hygiene practices, and farmers are able to access a sustainable water supply for local agriculture. The tanks are also acting as a tool for empowerment – helping communities to build disaster resilience and enabling families to secure their financial future through ensuring the viability and sustainability of agriculture.

“It is like a dream come true,” says Herbert, a farmer in the Chipapa community and a father of nine children. “For many years we longed for such a resource. We saw our dam dry up, day by day. We did not know what would become of us when the dam dried up completely.”","On 22 March we celebrate World Water Day and the work of World Vision to bring clean water to communities around the world.

441,https://www.borgenmagazine.com/water-quality-zambia/,Improving Water Quality in Zambia,"ZAMBIA — Home to almost 15 million people, Zambia is a landlocked country in southern Africa bordering Angola, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Tanzania, Malawi, Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Namibia. Like many nations in the region, water quality in Zambia does not meet the United Nation’s recent Sustainable Development Goals.

According to UNICEF, 36 percent of Zambians do not have access to clean water, and at least half of the population is without sanitation facilities. The concern over water quality in Zambia is unique, however, because approximately 40 percent of the entire southern African water supply is in Zambia. What accounts for this discrepancy?

The problem seems to stem from a lack of infrastructure. The rainy season in Zambia lasts from October to April, with rainfall virtually nonexistent outside these months. Though supplies of drinking water are reportedly adequate in wet months, it is estimated that only 37 percent of water is stored for use during the dry season. Without the storage infrastructure, water availability in Zambia can move quickly from feast to famine.

A further complication is the severe drought that has been ongoing throughout southern Africa since 2015. Though Zambia is located north of the worst-affected areas, the amount of water available from recent rainy seasons has been depleted. In some rural communities, people may have to walk multiple kilometers to retrieve water. For children, this responsibility can be the difference between attending school and missing out on an education.

According to Reuters, additional regulations for both surface and groundwater would reduce the rapid overuse of the water supply. However, such reforms would require the Zambian Water Management Authority to receive additional funding and staffing. Furthermore, water supplies are often tied to energy infrastructure, presenting a vicious feedback loop during shortages. When the water supply runs low, blackouts have been known to occur; when there are blackouts, water pumps operate less effectively.



As a result of poor water quality, a number of health concerns have arisen. Unsurprisingly, this includes diseases such as diarrhea, cholera and dysentery. The United Nations estimates that 11.4 percent of all deaths in Zambia relate to water, sanitation, and hygiene.

Despite everything, however, potential solutions are already being explored. Over the past five years, the percentage of government expenditure on water quality in Zambia has doubled. The total percentage still remains at less than one percent, but the additional spending is being used to construct new dams and is planned for 200 solar-powered boreholes (deep, narrow wells).

Already, these boreholes have made an exceptional impact. They have dramatically reduced the average rural distance to water sources, allowing students to return to school and halting the spread of waterborne diseases. Boreholes have also proven extremely cost-effective, with an average cost of $2000 and nearly no maintenance. Supplementary solutions will still be necessary in order to sustain improvements, but these changes are an encouraging sign for the quality of water, and life, in Zambia.

WITHOUT water, the world’s seven billion people and other living things on earth are doomed.

This is because the commodity is the lifeline of human existence.

Water is not just used for drinking and washing, it is a vital resource in many areas of human endeavour such as agriculture, aquaculture, and livestock husbandry, industrial and energy production.

As the global population is growing fast, there are fears that challenges of access to safe water will be more pronounced.

Indications are that Zambia, a country with about 82 percent of the population being under the age of 35, will not be spared in the event of a global water crisis.

Pollution, tempering with water bodies, deforestation and cutting down trees for agriculture purposes, commercial and industry developments are among harmful activities that threaten the existence of natural water.

When trees are cut, top soil tends to loosen and easily blows away or is washed in rivers, causing water bodies to slit up.

Lack of tree cover changes the way water stays in the ground and causes it to evaporate quickly.

This leaves streams and groundwater catchment areas drying up over a period of time.

The United Nations (UN) estimates that over the next 30 years, the demand for water is expected to double globally.

If nothing is done to address factors negatively affecting water, the number of people without access to safe water is anticipated to double.

UN resident co-ordinator Janet Rogan says threats to global water could see two-thirds of the world’s population living without access to safe water.

On average, almost 40 percent of the population in Zambia is unable to access safe water without walking a round trip of 30 minutes.

“In our rural areas, more than half of the population cannot get safe water without walking there and back, carrying it for thirty minutes.

And we know those usually fetching and carrying water are women and girls,” Ms Rogan said.

During the commemoration of International Water Day in Kabwe on March 22, Ms Rogan said despite more than 40 percent of water in Southern Africa flowing through Zambia, the country is experiencing severe water shortages.

This year’s International Water Day theme was “Nature for Water”.

Minister of Water Development, Sanitation and Environmental Protection Minister Dennis Wanchinga says in rural areas, households have less access to improved sources of drinking water, at 47 percent compared to 90 percent for urbanites.

“It is sad that even though Zambia has recorded positive outcomes in the provision of water and sanitation, there still remain some challenges,” Dr Wanchinga notes.

Environmental damages and climate change issues are of paramount concern to Government because these factors also drive water-related crises in Zambia.

Permanent and reliable streams in some areas in Zambia are gradually drying up because the trees are indiscriminately being cut down.

Rains become erratic and inconsistent because of destruction to nature.

As a result, people cannot access safe and clean water within manageable distance.

The manifest of floods, droughts and water pollution which accelerate degradation of the environment, soil, rivers and lakes, remains a source of concern.

When the ecosystem is neglected, availability of water essential for survival and for life to thrive, becomes a challenge.

Dr Wanchinga feels the protection of the environment and proper management of the ecosystem are important in reducing pollution and mitigation of floods as well as drought.

“I wish to appeal to people of Zambia to join hands with Government in the management of our water as well as natural resources,” he said.

Water Aid Zambia country director Pamela Chisanga bemoans that in this age, people in the country continue to experience challenges of access to clean water.

Others cover long distances to access the commodity.

“We still have a lot of people who cover long distances to fetch drinking water,” Ms Chisanga says.

“So, this is something that we need to address in terms of our environment and how we can manage it, including the water resources that we have.”

Ms Chisanga says the protection of water sources and ensuring that people have to water, especially in rural areas, is a must.

As the world was commemorating 25 years of International World Water Day, the UN released a water development report.

The report encourages humanity to think about natural solutions to preserving water and using natural water resources.

For this to be achieved, it is important to understand and accept the extent of how human activities damage the water system and what needs to be done to restore balance.

Ms Rogan says restoration of balance important, hence the need to stop open defaction, indiscriminate cutting of trees and encourage the preservation of wetlands (as they are reservoirs of clean water) and maintaining water balance systems.

In urban areas, it is important to harvest and use rain water, and further protect and preserve natural watershed, Ms Rogan urges.

“There are opportunities in waste water treatment with a perfect reason to focus on nature-based solutions such as waste stabilisation ponds, proper solid waste management systems, and water-efficient technologies,” Ms Rogan says.

Nature-based solutions like planting of new forests, reconnecting rivers to floodplains and restoring wetlands are cardinal in rebalancing water cycle.

And Dr Wanchinga assures that Government is implementing programmes aimed at improving water resource development and management.

“The use of nature-based solutions have shown potential to solve challenges related to the sustainable use of water and other environment and natural resource Dr Wanchinga said.

To increase awareness of nature-based solutions, Government has introduced statutory instruments to regulate extraction of underground water","As the global population is growing fast, there are fears that challenges of access to safe water will be more pronounced.

And the Auditor General has revealed that fuel worth K156,986 was drawn by motor vehicles that are not on the company fleet during the period under review.

According to the Auditor General’s report on the accounts of Water and Sanitation companies for the financial year ending December 31, 2018, the utility collected a total of K2,490,458 as sanitation surcharge, but only spent a sum of K533,650 on network rehabilitation.

“In 2007, NWASCO introduced a sanitation surcharge in order to contribute to the efforts government was making through infrastructure funding to the water sector. The sanitation surcharge forms part of the tariff structure and accounts for up to a maximum of five per cent of the monthly water bill. The revenue collections from the sanitation surcharge are ring-fenced so as to ensure that the funds are used on sanitation extension projects approved by NWASCO. The company was awarded the right to levy the customers the sanitation charge in 2015 at the rate of 2.5 per cent. A review of the billing and revenue collection information revealed that amounts totalling K2,490,458 had been collected as of November, 2019. The following were observed: Failure to open bank account. Contrary to the guidelines, the Company did not maintain a sanitation surcharge bank account into which the collected funds were to be deposited. Misapplication of Funds. Out of the total amount of K2,490,458 collected, the Company only spent a sum of K533,650 on network rehabilitation, while the balance of K1,956,808 was applied on unrelated activities,” the report revealed.

It also disclosed that Lukanga Water recorded a cumulative loss of over K44.8 million to leakages and commercial losses.

“Non-Revenue Water (NRW) is the difference between the quantity of treated water distributed in the network and quantity of water actually billed. NRW consists of technical (leakages) and commercial losses (illegal connections, unbilled customers, wastage on un-metred customers’ premises). According to NWASCO, the accepted level of NRW is from 20 per cent to 25 per cent of the quantity of treated water distributed in the network. However, during the period under review, the Company’s NRW was 52 per cent in 2017 and 51 per cent in 2018 against the recommended benchmark of 20 per cent to 25 per cent. This resulted in a cumulative revenue loss of K44,811,764,” it read.

“Profitability. Although the Company’s turnover increased from K41,743,481 in 2017 to K49,922,912 in 2018, the Company incurred losses of K2,349,034 in 2017 and K1,823,233 in 2018. This was attributed to the failure to keep total expenses below the total income.”

And the Auditor General revealed that fuel worth K156,986 was drawn by motor vehicles that were not on the company fleet during the period under review.

“Fuel Drawn by Motor Vehicles Not on Company Fleet. During the period under review, fuel costing K156,986 involving 443 transactions was drawn by motor vehicles, which were not among the fleet owned by the Company without authority. Although management in their responses stated that the use of private vehicles was in line with their transport policy and that approvals were granted by the Managing Director or heads of departments, management did not avail documentary evidence to show that the drawing of fuel by private vehicles had prior approvals,” it revealed.

The report further disclosed that 47 payment vouchers in amounts totalling over K1.8 million processed during the period under review were not availed for audit

“Missing Payment Vouchers. Contrary to Chapter 8.6.1 of the LgWSC accounting and procedures manual, which states that all payments must have a payment voucher, 47 payment vouchers in amounts totalling K1,815,029 processed during the period under review were not availed for audit. As a result, it could not be ascertained whether payment processes were followed and transactions properly authorised,” the report read.

Meanwhile, the water utility was also found to be owing the Zambia Revenue Authority (ZRA) amounts totalling over K15.5 million in unremitted statutory obligations as at December 31, 2019.

“Unremitted Statutory Obligations. As at 31st December, 2018, LgWSC owed the ZRA amounts totalling K15,537,858 in unremitted statutory obligations, thus risking being charged penalties, contrary to the Income Tax Act Chapter 323 of the laws of Zambia.

GweruCity Council is tightening its water rationing schedule, amid revelations that its alternative water source,

Amapongobwe, is at 17 percent full.

Gweru introduced the water rationing schedule early this year citing dwindling water levels at the city supply dam,

Gwenoro.

The local authority had to use a Government grant and devolution funds to revamp Amapongobwe as the alternative water source.

In an interview yesterday, Gweru City spokesperson, Ms Vimbai Chingwaramuse, said water levels at Amapongobwe were now at 17 percent.

“Gwenoro is now at 37 percent and Amapongobwe, which had become our alternative source, is now at 17 percent,” she said. “What is means is that we will re-visit our water rationing schedule and see how we can save water. We urge residents and all stakeholders to use

water responsibly.”

Since the introduction of water rationing, some suburbs in high lying areas have gone for months without running water.

The city was once hit by typhoid, which claimed over 10 lives as residents turned to unsafe water sources.

Gweru Mayor, Councillor Josiah Makombe, said the local authority was working on a programme to resuscitate broken down boreholes to augment the water supplies.

447,https://www.herald.co.zw/editorial-comment-step-up-fight-against-water-pollution/,Editorial Comment: Step up fight against water pollution,"Reports that 32 urban local authorities in the country are discharging more than 366 million litres of raw sewage every day into rivers and dams are worrisome and this flagrant disregard of legal requirements could contribute to public health risks and the destruction of our water biodiversity and ecosystems.

Our water bodies are very fragile and sensitive ecological systems. The massive pollution is going on unchecked with the Environment Management Authority only issuing warnings and penalties to local authorities.

The quality of water in most of the country’s rivers and water bodies has deteriorated significantly over the last decades, largely due to poor investment in water infrastructure and sewage treatment.

Two main recurrent sources of pollution are getting worse: storm-water runoff contaminated with garbage, oil, chemicals and other pollutants and the discharge of combined storm water and untreated sewage. There is no clear sign of these being stopped.

Water pollution has come with a heavy price. For instance, Harare is spending between US$2 million and US$3 million monthly to procure water treatment chemicals because its supply dams are so filthy.

Municipalities, the Government, development actors and EMA should work together to eliminate all combined discharges of untreated or partially treated sewage to reduce public health risks and the destruction of marine biodiversity.

This will require incorporating green infrastructure strategies into building and zoning codes and strengthening clean-water standards. Residents and civil society have a big role to play.

While storm water drains and sewers are supposed to be separate, and there was a time when inspectors would force those allowing storm water to enter sewers to take swift action, we now have storm water flowing into drains with no one caring.

At the same time, the storm water drains are frequently clogged with earth or stone, allowing them to overflow, and are frequently choked with rubbish, chemicals and the like. The situation is dire during the rainy season.

These outflows present significant ecological and public health issues, as they generate algal blooms, reduce water quality and biodiversity, increase fish and other marine deaths and create the potential for waterborne-disease outbreaks.

Deaths were recorded in recent months in Bulawayo due to deadly water pollutants.

More sewage and pollutants are threatening our wetlands, rivers and other natural systems that protect against flooding.

Communities that discharge raw sewage into waterways must also be encouraged to play their part through separating sanitary waste and other pollutants that block sewer systems. Stones, bricks, metal rods and an assortment of other pollutants make control of overflows difficult.

Municipalities must step up efforts to engage local communities to scale up efforts to eliminate the discharge of raw sewage into our water bodies. Stopping the discharge of raw sewage into our own water bodies, is everyone’s responsibility.

The private sector, SMES and all other players must also be engaged to help our municipalities and the country to clean up their act.

Other cities elsewhere in the world are accelerating the establishment of neighbourhood green districts that implement pilot projects to curb the blocking and discharge of raw sewage into water bodies.

Some even go further to impose a storm-water utility fee to fund and advance new infrastructure initiatives to reduce the discharge of raw sewage into rivers.

Greater emphasis must also be placed on improving transparency and accountability in the operations of the municipalities which have seen a number of their officials arrested for corruption.

Municipalities need to invest more in improving water and sewer infrastructure to help reduce overflows in the long run.

Sewage discharge mitigation strategies could include treatment-plant upgrades and the construction of large retention tanks to hold overflows until the polluted water can be treated. These are now a major requirement.

These investments will help the municipalities to reduce the discharge of raw sewer significantly over time. Municipalities should set strong water-quality standards that encourage them to deploy green infrastructure strategies.

They will need to invest in these systems using innovative financing tools and plans.

Some environmental experts say incorporating green roofs, rain gardens, permeable pavement and water — retentive cisterns into new and renovated large-scale housing developments can reduce the load of water and sewage management systems.

Municipal planning and environmental protection agencies should require a higher standard of green infrastructure in all local building and housing locations to help reduce the discharge of raw sewage into our water bodies.

Councils are legally obliged to treat sewage before it is released into our water bodies, but for years they have ignored warnings about the growing scale of spills from sewage overflows.

The public is shocked at the frequency of sewage discharges and the damage it does to some of our country’s most precious and valuable river habitats.

The inability of EMA to prosecute or even drive improvement has led us to where we are today — in a complete shambles with water pollution rife and unchecked. The situation is very alarming and practical steps to end this problem need to be taken as a matter of urgency.

Our people deserve clean water free of the many dangerous pollutants found in sewage.

The only way to ensure this is to stop sewage overflows and leaks and ensure that no sewage is released into our streams, rivers, dams and lakes untreated.

We have to put our priorities right and invest more in our wastewater infrastructure to save lives.","Our water bodies are very fragile and sensitive ecological systems.

Water shortages have hit Harare’s dormitory town of Ruwa after it decommissioned its major water supply dam, Nora Valley, which dried up early this year due to poor rainfall last season.

Ruwa’s projected daily water demand is nearly 40 megalitres and Nora Valley dam supplies at least half, while the rest comes from Harare.

The town, located 25km east of the capital, has since started installing solar-powered boreholes in some areas including Damafalls and Zimre to mitigate the water crisis.

449,http://kubatana.net/2020/07/16/byo-water-crisis-worries-parliament/,Byo water crisis worries Parliament – Kubatana.net,"A Bulawayo legislator Anele Ndebele on Wednesday made a passionate plea in Parliament for Government to urgently declare the Bulawayo water crisis a state of disaster in a bid to attract development partners.

Ndebele raised the issue following the death of at least 13 Luveve residents while thousands were affected from a diarrhoea outbreak that occurred after they drank contaminated tap water.

Early this year Government ruled out declaring the city a water crisis area saying there was enough water to last up to 14 months.

The government consultants said the water challenges in the city were merely technical.

Residents in the city are enduring at least 144 hours of water shedding with the city’s supply dams now below 30 percent of their capacity.

Said Ndebele, “Hon. Speaker, I wish to address myself quickly to the Luveve water situation.

“From as early as May this year, residents of Luveve in Bulawayo have been getting sick from drinking Municipal water,” the Parliamentary Hansard quoted him saying.

“The same has happened in Lobengula, Magwegwe, Mpopoma and elsewhere but without causing death. The Luveve water supply conundrum Hon. Speaker Sir, is not just a Luveve issue, it is a Bulawayo issue and by extension, a Zimbabwean issue.

“I have a prayer Hon. Speaker for our Hon. Minister of Local Government in line with Section 77 of our Constitution, if it pleases you Hon. Minister of Local Government (July Moyo), could you kindly and urgently declare the Bulawayo water situation a state of disaster so that the response thereto becomes global and we get cooperating partners assisting our Government in dealing with Luveve water situation urgently.”

In response, the Speaker of Parliament Jacob Mudenda ‘blocked’ debates on the issue saying Ndebele’s “delivery was as clear as water, we do not want to dilute it”.

“The Hon. Minister of Local Government I am sure has taken note of that and will respond accordingly,” Mudenda reportedly said.

As the water crisis escalates, the city fathers are pleading with residents to accept the recycling of Khami Dam water as it works on alternative solutions to the city’s water crisis.

The local authority has identified recycling of Khami Dam water as one of the sustainable ways of providing running water to the city.

However, council face an uphill task in convincing residents to accept the plan as they have in the past objected to recycling of the heavily polluted water.

But the local authority believes advanced technology will make the water safe for drinking and the recycling project will cost about US$28 million.

With the declararation of the city’s water crisis a national disaster, it will pave way for the local authority to engage local and international funding partners.

But in February, the city fathers debated during a full council meeting over the possible ripple effects such a declaration would have on the economy of Bulawayo.

They raised fears that an announcement that Bulawayo was running dry and appealing for assistance from the international community would scare away potential investors who may be considering bringing business to the city.

The Environmental Management Agency (EMA) has expressed concern over the increasing pollution of ground and surface water sources by urban local authorities, who are discharging at least 366 mega litres of raw sewer into the environment daily.

The agency has also attributed the surge in pollution to ageing sewer treatment infrastructure designs in most town councils, which is being overwhelmed by increasing waste generation and their capacity has been surpassed.

EMA’s manager responsible for Education and Environment, Ms Amkela Sidange, on Tuesday said they had since conducted an assessment on most local authorities’ sewage plants to ascertain the state of affairs.

Sanyati Rural District Council has stepped up efforts to improve the availability of healthy and potable water to its various communities under its jurisdiction in line with World Health Organisation (WHO) standards.

The council’s chief executive, Mr Archim Shadaya recently told The Herald that the local authority was constructing more clinics to reduce the distances that people have to travel to access health care.

“We have managed to build two clinics namely Chegutu 6 Clinic (Ward 7) and Carfex Clinic (Ward 4), and residents are now receiving primary health care,” he said.

He said his council was also addressing water supply issues at the clinics through drilling boreholes.

“We are also working on renovating an old farm house in Ward 5 into a clinic. Bills of quantities have been done of what is required to make the structures suitable for operating and procurement proceedings are currently underway,” he said.

The small southern African country of Botswana is known to hold one of the world’s highest economic growth rates since achieving independence in 1966. The nation of 2.2 million people has transformed from its initial impoverished state to a middle-income country through diamond mining, tourism and common farming practices.

Due to the downturn in the global diamond market, however, the economy experienced a low point following the 2008 global recession, with widespread water and power shortages. In just this past year, water quality in Botswana has demanded significant attention as the nation entered its fourth year of drought, posing serious threats to the agriculture sector. Here are five things you should know about water quality in Botswana.

A 2012 water sector policy brief conducted by United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) stated that Botswana’s water sources consist primarily of underground water and surface water (rivers, pans and dams), all of which are shared with neighboring countries. Collecting enough water for households and communities has posed several challenges in response to access and exerts additional pressure on Botswana’s water resources. Worsening climatic conditions only emphasize the depth of droughts and the crisis of water quality in Botswana. These factors force individuals to turn to the government to build infrastructure, find adequate solutions and join different South African pipeline schemes, though they will be costly. While the country has water in dams in the north, that water cannot be moved down to the south. In March 2017, The World Bank approved a $145.5 million loan to the Republic of Botswana for the Emergency Water Security and Efficiency Project, which will help Botswana cope with increased water stress arising from the drought crisis, and aid in the sustainable development of the country, given current climate change projections. Hundreds of thousands of people will benefit from this plan to restore existing water supply systems and improve the sustainability of water resources in Botswana. According to the CIA World Factbook, drinking water sources have improved for 96.2 percent of the total population, leaving 3.8 percent of the total population with unimproved sources. Sanitation facility access has reportedly improved for 63.4 percent of the total population and remains unimproved for 36.6 percent of the total population.

The issue of drought and water quality in Botswana leaves the country in a position where its people must adapt to water scarcity. Fortunately, with the introduction of environmental projects and recognition of the problem, efficient methods of restoring the economy of Botswana and its industries will soon take effect.

The Gaborone Dam sits in a short stack of hills on the outskirts of Botswana's capital. Today it is parched silt, the punishing heat having burned off the little water left behind after a storm last week snapped a dry spell that has felt endless to many residents.

A sleepy, low-rise city of 230,000 people, Gaborone is the heart of the global diamond industry, which is fed by the giant Jwaneng and Orapa mines to the east and north. It is a prosperous place by regional standards, but a deep drought across most of Southern Africa has meant that the city has been experiencing rolling water outages for the first time in living memory for most Batswana.

It is an unprecedented and frightening situation in a country that has a reputation as one of Africa's best-run economies — a rare place that has successfully translated its diamond wealth into genuine development — and one which illustrates how climate change is undermining progress and creating new challenges for societies in the developing world. As extreme weather events become more severe and more frequent, experts warn that decades of work and billions of dollars spent in bringing populations out of poverty in Southern Africa could be undone.

""The cost of the solutions that are going to have to be put in, they are going to eclipse the development priorities of the country,"" said Muyeye Chambwera, a technical specialist at the United Nations Development Program who advises the government of Botswana on sustainable development. ""The advent of climate change is worsening this situation as we speak. This is a situation that this country has never experienced before.""

Scrubland around Jwaneng township is dry after weeks without rain.

The Jwaneng diamond mine is among the world's richest, and mining companies are under pressure to limit their water use as the drought bites.

The impact on the economy has been immediate, and exacerbated by a parallel shortage of energy.

Martin Kadwe, who runs a pottery business on the outskirts of town, supplying hotels and the tourist trade, has to bring water in from a borehole, paying 300 pula ($30) for a 2,500 liter tank that he brings in on a flatbed truck. Without water, his business would close, but he is losing money and time fixing the problem.

""It's been three weeks out of the last four,"" he said. ""This has never happened before.""

""It affects everyone from top to bottom. Shops have to shut down because there's no water in the bathroom,"" said Imraan Arbi, an entrepreneur who runs a logistics business in Gaborone.

Big companies have tanks and reserves, which have allowed them to mitigate some of the worst effects, but everyone is suffering. Hotels are rationing water to their guests, and the small manufacturing sector is struggling without water for cooling and cleaning.

""It has had a socialising effect,"" Arbi said. ""People call their friends and say: 'Have you got water, have you got power?' and everyone goes over there.""

Entrepreneur Martin Kadwe has had to resort to buying water from a local borehole, paying $30 to fill his tank.

Botswana is not alone in its current crisis. South Africa, the continent's second largest and arguably most sophisticated economy, is also suffering from the drought. The water utilities have had to impose rolling outages in its cities. The agriculture industry there — which is mostly water-intensive, irrigated farming — has turned to the government for bailouts after their yields collapsed, leaving many unable to service their debts. Hundreds of thousands of cattle may have to be slaughtered early, as there is not enough feed or water to sustain them.

In Zimbabwe, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN has warned that cereal yields could fall by half, pushing thousands of people back into dependence on aid.

Water stress has been a concern in the region for years, but worsening climatic conditions mean the depth of droughts have outpaced government capacity to build infrastructure and fix perennial problems, such as leaky urban water systems and over use of scarce water resources by industry and consumers.

In 1990, Botswana acknowledged that it needed to upgrade its water infrastructure and began a 30-year plan, according to Minister of Minerals, Energy, and Water Resources Onkokame Kitso Mokaila.

""If we had done everything it said, we wouldn't be where we are now,"" he said.

The country has water in dams in the north, but cannot move it down to Gaborone in the south.

""So the real problem is caused by a lack of infrastructure, rather than a lack of water,"" Mokaila said.

The government of Botswana is turning to huge and costly projects to try to insure the country against future crises. It will join a South African scheme to pipe water from Lesotho, a heavily forested mountain country that is a rare water tower for the region. Another pipeline will snake down from the Zambezi to the north. Both will require massive capital investments, and will give upstream countries considerable bargaining power over their neighbors.

The notion that water is an economic resource as well as a public good may have to become more widely accepted as the supply tightens.

""We're in a difficult situation, we don't have many rivers, which is why there is a lot of groundwater use,"" said Keith Jefferis, one of Botswana's leading economists and the former deputy governor of its central bank. ""Essentially, that water is being mined, and we're taking it out faster than it's being replenished. The sustainability of water resources is not really sufficiently taken into account.""

The country needs to figure out how to better value its environmental services, according to Jefferis — a politically sensitive calculation that could disadvantage several influential constituencies.

""Water [in Botswana] is too cheap for a water-scarce country,"" he said. ""Farmers don't pay for water. Mining companies don't pay for water. They take water from boreholes. There's no user fee. Once they've put in the infrastructure, the water's free… If you mine diamonds, you pay a royalty to government. If you mine water, you don't.""

Gaborone, Botswana's sleepy capital, is the centre of the diamond business, but the economy is struggling due to water and power crises.

Bruce Cleaver, head of strategy at De Beers, which runs the country's largest mining operations in a joint venture with the government, said that the company has invested heavily in water efficiency and recycling at its mines.

As decisions over infrastructure financing go on at the upper echelons of government, ordinary Batswana — and the citizens of neighboring countries — will need to come to terms with the new normal of routine water scarcity — and adapt.

""People used to build houses with five bathrooms. Each kid had a bathroom. Those things must stop,"" Mokaila said. ""We have to talk about efficiency. We have to re-engineer our economy and our industries.""

""The Project will help Botswana cope with increased water stress, arising from a number of factors including chronic drought,"" said Paul Noumba Um, the World Bank Country Director. ""The proposed measures are therefore critical for the sustainable development of the country, particularly given current climate change projections.""

The Project was prepared in response to the 2015-2016 El-Nino related drought, which was rated extremely severe - the worst in the last 34 years. Although droughts in Botswana are chronic, acute events such as the 2015-2017 drought further aggravate the fragile water balance. In 2015, overall dam levels fell below 20 percent of their design capacity; and ground water sources in several water supply schemes dried up or became saline. The Project will improve the availability of water supply in drought vulnerable areas, strengthen waste water management in selected systems and improve the operational efficiency of the Water Utilities Corporation.

""While the recent rains have alleviated the dry conditions faced over the past three years, due to low recharge rates, groundwater levels will take several years to recover,"" said Mukami Kariuki, World Bank Task Team Leader. ""The Project will also support the Governments ongoing efforts to integrate and manage surface and ground water resources more effectively.""

456,https://new.abb.com/news/detail/54516/quenching-the-thirst-for-water-in-botswana,Quenching the thirst for water in Botswana,"In this landlocked country of around two million people, the climate is arid, rainfall is not always dependable and droughts may last for several years. Furthermore, while reservoirs exist in the northeast, demand for this resource is growing fastest in the southeast around the capital city of Gaborone, where the population is expanding. Alongside this, mining activities are increasing, a major contributor to Botswana's now thriving economy.

""Water is far more than just a commodity in Botswana, and access to it is not something you can take for granted. The North-South Carrier has allowed this country to make great progress, but there are still people who have to walk to reach a water supply,"" says Kevin Kosisko, Managing Director of the Power Generation & Water business, part of ABB's Industrial Automation division.

This reflects a rising global demand for water: for example, since 1950 the need for this resource has trebled and it will double again by 2050. Meanwhile, a sixth of the global population does not have access to safe water. Underlining its importance to both health and economic development, the availability of water for all is included in number six of the UN's Sustainable Development Goals. ""Many people in developed countries don't understand what it means not to have water. For people in African communities, gaining such access is one of the biggest accomplishments they will see in their lives,"" Kosisko states.

Build it and water will come

Under the Botswana National Water Master Plan, a huge-scale water infrastructure project - the North-South Carrier - was launched in the mid-1990s. Broken down into two phases, the first of these (NSC-1) was completed in 2000 and saw the Letsibogo Dam constructed in the country's northeast along with an approximately 360-kilometer pipeline to carry the water south to Gabarone, as well as pumping stations, treatment plants and other infrastructure. The percentage of people with access to safe drinking water rose from 77 percent to 96 percent between 1996 and 2006.

The second phase (NSC-2) is now ongoing, and will duplicate the pipeline to carry water from the new Dikgatlhong Dam, which was completed in 2012. ABB has already been involved in an earlier package of this second phase, which is now complete, supplying a power and automation solution for a new water pipeline and pump station.

""There were certainly learnings from the first project,"" Kosisko explains. ""Our professionalism and commitment won us a follow-on order."" ABB is now involved in executing another package, which is planned for completion next year. The scope of supply includes ABB Ability™ Symphony® Plus distributed control system (DCS), an instrumentation package and other power equipment.

ABB Ability Symphony Plus is especially tailored for the water and power industries. It is part of a portfolio of automation, instrumentation and electrification solutions for water plants and networks, covering all segments of the water cycle, offered by ABB's Power Generation & Water business. This leading DCS can boast over 400 water, wastewater and desalination installations worldwide.

""The supply of water is very important in Botswana. Our customers need to have a strong partner who is able to deliver, offers the latest technology and has already gained crucial experience. Projects like this show the full potential of advanced automation for all communities dealing with rapid expansions or aging infrastructures,"" comments Kosisko.

Change for the future

Availability of water and economic development are closely linked on numerous levels. There are decent jobs linked to water management in both the developed and developing world; moreover, access to safe drinking water and sanitation protects people from disease and allows them to attend school or work without disruption, leading to higher education and employment, which are the foundation for growth.

According to a 2016 UN World Water Development report, investment in small-scale projects providing access to safe water and basic sanitation in Africa could offer an estimated economic return of about $28.4 billion a year, or nearly five percent of gross domestic product (GDP) of the continent.

""If there's no water, there's no development,"" Kosisko sums up. ""But once there's water, electricity is the next step. When a community has these two 'commodities', it can set up small industries, and this might make a community become independent which would change lives. These are milestones in humanity, and it is important to be part of the evolution of humanity.""

GABORONE, Feb. 19 (Xinhua) -- Botswana, Lesotho and South Africa will share the cost of the construction of a 600-km water pipeline that will run from Lesotho through South Africa to Botswana.

This was revealed in an interview on Tuesday with Rapule Pule, a water resource specialist from the Orange-Senqu River Commission (ORASECOM), in Francistown, the second largest city of Botswana.

ORASECOM is the institution responsible for managing the resources of the Orange-Senqu River Basin, a transboundary resource shared by Botswana, Namibia, Lesotho and South Africa.

Botswana will import water from Lesotho through the 600-km pipeline that will run from Lesotho across South Africa to its capital Gaborone.

Lesotho has a water surplus as the mountains there could easily trap water from the Senqu River, Vaal River and Orange River, among other water streams.

Two proposed dam construction sites have been identified by consultants along the Makhaleng River, and a pre-feasibility study is being conducted to find possible sites for water dams to be built.

The size and cost of the dams will be determined by the feasibility study, which is funded to the tune of 2.3 million U.S. dollars by the African Development Bank.

Namibia will not share the costs as it is an observer to the program, Pule said.

The project is likely to be funded through donors.

Villages along the proposed pipeline are also expected to benefit from the project.

Water supply in Gaborone has been sustained by imported water from North West Province of South Africa after Botswana was hit by successive drought periods.

Ministers responsible for water from the respective countries signed a Memorandum of Agreement recently, aiming to provide policy and political guidance for the project, and review progress on the implementation of the 10-year integrated water resource management plan adopted in 2015. That plan attempts to guide management, development and conservation of water resources of the Orange-Senqu River Basin.","Source: Xinhua| 2019-02-20 13:05:57|Editor: WXVideo Player CloseGABORONE, Feb. 19 (Xinhua) -- Botswana, Lesotho and South Africa will share the cost of the construction of a 600-km water pipeline that will run from Lesotho through South Africa to Botswana.

Botswana’s biggest water project Emergency Water Security and Efficiency Project ((WSRP) which has been funded by the World Bank by a $145.5 million loan and meant to address water crisis by 2021 is turning into just a dream.

The multibillion project is said to have opened flood gates for corruption from senior government officials and some cabinet ministers who have now stalled the progress thus denying the nation access to clean water especially in the southern and North West part of the country.

SEE ALSO:

World Bank is said to be worried at the slow pace of implementing the project which is embroiled in legal tussle between government and some multi-national companies over tender irregularities.

The great concern is the North South Carrier (NSC) II which some officials of World Bank have labeled as being embroiled in dirty water politics involving even members of the Directorate of Intelligence Services (DIS).

MLWS and WUC flouting World Bank’s Guidelines on Preventing and Combating Fraud and Corruption in Projects

Ministry of Land Management, Water & Sanitation Services (MLWS) and Water Utilities Corporation (WUC) who are the implementers of the project are said to be flouting World Bank’s new Procurement Framework (NPF).

SEE ALSO:

Some Project Management Officers have raised a red flag that WUC want to violate loan guidelines which are meant to combat fraud and corruption and has since raised the issue to the World Bank officials.

One of the sections flouted is 9 (a) i which stipulates that the borrower must adopt appropriate fiduciary and administrative practices and institutional arrangements to ensure that the proceeds of the Loan are used only for the purpose of which the loan was granted.

SEE ALSO:

Recently WUC board proposed the change of scope of NSC II project by resuscitating the construction of the 100 kilometer pipeline which was rejected by cabinet last year. The board against the advice of the Project Management Officers wants the P400 million meant for Lobatse Water Master Plan which is part of the loan from World Bank.

The PMO are allegedly to have pleaded with World Bank officials to address the issues as it has the potential to leave most Batswana without access to safe drinking water.

This is one of the projects that have been funded by World Bank and according to sources within MLWS it could have long been completed.

SEE ALSO:

Currently there is susceptible to the quality of drinking water in Maun as it is brownish in color and has after taste, a situation that the project was going to address.

Though Chinese company, China Jiangsu International Botswana won the tender at the tune of P1.5 billion in October 2018 but MLWS dragged their feet in providing them with letter of award or written confirmation of contract of award.

SEE ALSO:

Through their lawyers Montlhe Marumo & Co wrote a letter to PPADB requesting that China Jiangsu be provided with a contract to sign and commerce work.

Early this year DIS entered the fray and advised MLWS to cancel the tender warning that the intelligence they have gathered suggest that the company has been involved in activities that border on the threat of national security.

SEE ALSO:

In a shocking move to the PMO, the tender was awarded to Zhentai Group at the tune of P1.8 billion though the matter was still before the courts of law.

The tender has since been interdicted until the matter is resolved thus further putting the lives of North West in danger.

SEE ALSO:

The DIS are said to have failed to provide the company with the information as instructed by the court on what national security threat they are posing.

Last week DIS officials are said to have went to MLWS and collected consultancy tender documents and evaluation reported which was submitted in 2014.

SEE ALSO:

The delay in the project is going to affect 175,631 in the North West district that won’t have access to safe drinking water.

NSC II

SEE ALSO:

The biggest project under WSRP is NSC which was meant to address acute water shortage in the Southern part of Botswana.

NSC II pipeline was supposed to bring 120 mega litres of water per day down the pipeline with 110 mega litres per day reaching Mmamashia Water Treatment Plant Works.

SEE ALSO:

The Mmamashia West and East wells are supposed to augment the water from the dams in the north during the dry season. This is now just a pipe dream the project is now being fought before the courts will Batswana are in desperate need of potable water.

The project has been divided into four components and all of them are before the court which many within the industry are saying is because of political interference.

Early this year PMO were allegedly instructed by the Office of the President to suspend the awarding of the P1.3 billion Masama/Mmamashia pipeline project as the three shortlisted listed were not favored.

Corruption in the water and sanitation sector

SEE ALSO:

Transparency International in their 2018 report on the Impact of corruption in the water and sanitation sector have raised a concern that it has generated water poverty by reducing the quality and availability of services, with disproportionate and adverse effects on the poor and marginalized.

“The incentives for corruption in the water sector are high: water sector institutions are natural monopolies responsible for projects with high initial capital and maintenance costs, and which are managed by officials with large amounts of discretionary power,” reads the report.

SEE ALSO:

The 2018 report highlights that in countries where water resources are becoming scarce, water corruption will likely become an increasingly serious problem.

The report notes that nine of the 10 countries with growing markets for private water and sanitation investments experience ""high risks of corruption.""

SEE ALSO:

The World Bank estimates that, globally, between 20% to 40% of public investment meant for the water sector is lost to corruption.

If not contained, corruption within the water sector including Botswana can lead to failure to meet the United Nations Millennium Development Goal of halving the number of people without access to safe drinking water.

“The current drought should not be considered as a sporadic event, but rather as a driver for acquiring water security as a national priority,” the independent expert stressed at the end of a nine-day official visit* to Botswana. “A strategic and participatory process, oriented to the provision of water and sanitation for all, will be a short-cut to prevent illnesses and deaths related to water-borne diseases and economic losses.”

A significant part of the population is currently facing a severe water shortage due to a long drought in the country. People in Greater Gaborone Area and other cities are under starker water rationing, with several consecutive days in a week without any supply. “Such a measure hits the poor and the vulnerable hardest,” Mr. Heller said noting that the situation raises serious human rights concerns of water quality, water quantity and related health impacts.

As water stress in Botswana is predicted to get higher and higher due to the impact of climate change and increasing water demand, “the Government must establish measures in order to prevent severe environmental situations from translating into water shortage, affecting people’s standard of living,” he said.

“The non-retrogression in access to safe drinking water and sanitation is one of the most important obligations of the human rights framework,” the Special Rapporteur underscored.

Water and sanitation in rural villages are a matter of great concern. “Although notable progresses have been made in the water and sanitation sector in Botswana, it is now time to set up efforts to include those who live in small villages and especially people living in particularly water stressed parts of the country, in the expansion of public utilities,” added the Special Rapporteur, who talked with several communities and visited some households during his mission.

“I found an alarming level of highly precarious water supply in these villages – in some cases with no public provision at all” he said. “In the same villages, the bush was the only solution to most of the people’s physiological needs. I was surprised by still a common practice of open defecation in villages”



“In a community in Sexaxa, a family explained to me how women and girls need to fetch water from a river, located not less than 1 km from the household. They consume an average of 20 litres of brown river water per person per day without boiling because they cannot afford or have access to fuel. Such a situation does not meet human rights requirements,” the expert added.

Equality and non-discrimination is a core human rights principle. Botswana upholds this principle in its Constitution, and it is therefore expected to guide the implementation of water and sanitation services as well as the comprehensive strategy to address water scarcity, the expert noted. “A policy oriented by the principle of equality must address the needs of people in rural areas, including resettled communities,” he said.

“The Government of Botswana is at a critical moment to translate its commitment to prioritize access to sanitation and safe drinking water for personal and domestic uses into full implementation. I am confident that the Government, who is making progresses in this regard, has the capacity to make the human rights to water and sanitation a reality for everyone in the country,” Mr. Heller concluded.

The Special Rapporteur will present a final report on his official visit to the UN Human Rights Council in September 2016, which will include his final findings and recommendations to the Government of Botswana.

Botswana, officially the Republic of Botswana is a landlocked country located in Southern Africa. up to 70% is covered by the Kalahari Desert. It is bordered by South Africa to the south and southeast, Namibia to the west and north, and Zimbabwe to the northeast. Its border with Zambia to the north near Kazungula.

Most dams on rivers have been constructed for urban water supplies or for livestock watering. The major dams are constructed on the larger rivers and some have required international agreements. It is considered that most ‘good’ sites for larger dams have now been used or are reserved for large water supply dams (for urban and industrial water uses), which are expected to be constructed in the near future. The smaller dams on smaller rivers currently suffer from sedimentation and irregular stream flows, making planning for use by irrigation difficult. Many earth dams built for livestock watering and irrigation (over 240 since 1970) have also suffered from lack of maintenance and many are now not in use.

The World Bank reports that at least 80 countries have water shortages and 2 billion people lack access to clean water. More disturbingly, the World Health Organization has reported that 1 billion people lack enough water to simply meet their basic needs, unfortunately in many countries water is scarce or contaminated.

Pure Aqua provides wide range of filtration and economical solutions based on the Botswana’s water resources.

Botswana’s main water resources are:

Surface water is water from river, lake or fresh water wetland, which can be treated using different methods, such as Ultrafiltration Systems, Brackish Water RO.

Ground Water or brackish water is from water located in the pore space of soil and rock “Borehole well”, which can be treated using Reverse Osmosis Systems , Chemical Dosing, UV Water Sterilizer .

Chemical Dosing, Government water supply, which could have high level of hardness or high level of chlorine, can be treated with Water Softener System , Media Water Filters.

Facing a downturn in the economy since the 2008 global recession, Botswana has experienced continuous and extreme water shortages. Years of drought has diminished Botswana’s water quality, which has led to severe issues in the agriculture sector. Here are important features regarding water quality in Botswana:

Most of Botswana’s water sources consist of surface water areas such as rivers, dams and underground water sources. Extracting enough water for consuming and other purposes creates several challenges in return to attainment and puts greater pressure on Botswana’s water reserves. Bad climate makes for even worse droughts and exacerbates the water quality crisis in Botswana. Botswana has looked to solve water stress issues with the restoration of existing water supply systems and the inclusion of more water treatment systems from sources such as Pure Aqua. Continued water treatment solutions have increased the availability of fresh drinking water for about 97% of the total population Access to quality sanitation has been greatly enhanced for more than 60% of the total population

Fortunately, Pure Aqua recognizes the problem Botswana faces and provides water treatment projects tailor made to address these issues. Our water purification systems are designed to restore the economy of Botswana and its industries with ultra pure water. We have full delivery capacities and service offerings that are accessible throughout the country and come with complete engineered water treatment solutions.

The Vice-President, Mr Mokgweetsi Masisi said during a kgotla meeting in Goo-kodisa recently that contrary to notion held by some detractors, the P3.3 billion share apportioned to MMEWR would help put up the necessary infrastructure and thereby mitigate water shortage especially on the Southern part of Botswana.

“Nowadays, everybody is an expert when it comes to water but the truth of the matter is that it is the same government that attracted a barrage of criticism from cynics when the idea to connect the North/Water carrier project was instituted,” he said.

Mr Masisi, who is also a legislator for Moshupa/Manyana constituency said a number of projects among them drilling of Masama boreholes are afoot to address water shortage.

He reminded Goo-Kodisa populace that a number of water sources within the greater Gaborone chief among them Gaborone and Bokaa dams have dried up. He urged residents to include water tanks during the design of their houses to harvest rain water.

Mr Masisi reminded everybody that infrastructure alone in the absence of rain is not enough. He therefore called on Batswana to pray to God to release rain.

Goo-Kodisa residents whom government has given a new lease of life by withdrawing the court decision to demolish their houses called on Moshupa sub land board to issue them with home ownership certificates.

Moshupa Sub Land Board secretary, Ms Frengelin Selemogwe told residents that the issuance of certificate would take a little while because surveying of the entire area (Goo-Kodisa) would have to be carried out first.

“Surveying has started and it is in full throttle for the entire area so that we can have a clear picture of the plots available, space available and it is from this point that we will take the maps in question to council before the process of issuance of certificates,” she told the packed kgotla.

She said information that would be gathered during the surveys forms are important ingredient in the issuance of the certificates in question because it was inclusive of things such as measurements of the homesteads.

Earlier on, Goo-Kodisa Village Development Committee chairperson, Ms Baratwa Kesetse commended Water Utilities Corporation for bowsing water to the village and remained hopeful the corporation would in future augment the water given to Goo-Kodisa populace.

Water Utilities Corporation manager for Kanye management centre, Mr Matthews Sebina concurred with Ms Kesetse but added the corporation was humstrung by shortage of resources such as trucks used to ferry water across the sub district.

He also assured them that plans were ongoing to come up with modalities on how best Goo-Kodisa could be connected to the North/South carrier that passes through the village via Moshupa to Kanye.“Unfortunately, your case with government was still on going at the time designs for the pipeline was carried out and we did not know your fate,” he said.

Mr Masisi suggested that Goo-Kodisa vicinity to Thamaga coupled with the fact that a pump station is being constructed at the same makes Thamaga an ideal point to connect Goo-Kodisa. Ends

Addressing Boteti Sub-district disaster management committee recently, Water Utilities (WUC) waterworks superintendent, Mr Mmothi Segale said that with the expected low rainfall, the WUC anticipates continuous supply challenges.

He stated that water supply has been diminishing in recent months due to the significant drop in daily output coupled with the amount of heat that had resulted in water resources stretched.

Mr Segale said the corporation supplies water to Letlhakane and 16 smaller villages, noting that the daily demand of Letlhakane is 2111 million litres of water while the WUC’s daily supply is 2348 million litres. He said in spite of the numbers, there was still a deficit in their water supply.

“Since Letlhakane is growing by leaps and bounds there are a lot of construction activities going on hence a deficit in the current water situation,” he said. The waterworks superintendent noted that as a result, they proposed to equip two more boreholes from the current five and construct a six kilometres transmission line to augment supply to the village.

Mr Segale said the project had been included in the drought relief emergency projects and survey of the proposed lines had been carried out and the project would soon get underway.

He said that Mopipi boreholes are shallow sunk boreholes which depend predominantly on seasonal rainfall.

“With the current scenario of low rainfall this year, some aquifers are already showing signs of depletion which renders this year a disastrous year,” he said.

He cautioned that most rural villages and settlements in the area are experiencing poor water quality (class II), adding that due to financial constraints they cannot not make desalination plants.

Mr Segale said that they are banking on the ongoing P300 million Boteti Northern Cluster project. The corporation has also observed that there are water loses due to vandalism and pipe leakages.

465,https://cdkn.org/2018/10/opinion-what-global-warming-of-1-5-%E2%84%83-and-higher-means-for-botswana-and-namibia/?loclang=en_gb,OPINION: What global warming of 1.5 ℃ and higher means for Botswana and Namibia,"Mark New and Brendon Bosworth describe how global warming of 1.5℃ and higher will mean even greater warming and damaging impacts for climate change ‘hotspots’ in the southern Africa region. The authors share new analysis from the Adaptation at Scale in Semi-Arid Regions (ASSAR) project on what this means for Botswana and Namibia.

The release this week of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) special report on global warming of 1.5℃ above pre-industrial levels marks a critical point in climate negotiations. Billed in the media as “life changing,” the report illustrates how crossing the ever-nearer threshold of 1.5℃ warming will affect the planet, and how difficult it will be to avoid overshooting this target.

The special report takes a worldwide look at the growing impacts of climate change. But for countries like Botswana and Namibia, which are highly vulnerable to climate stresses, it’s important to understand how surpassing the 1.5℃ global limit will play out at the local level.

For these hot, dry and water-stressed countries, local warming and drying will be greater than the global average. So, even a 1.5°C increase in global temperature will have severe local impacts, ushering in intensified and longer droughts and many more heatwaves. Ironically, when rain does fall, it is expected to be much heavier, increasing the risk of heavy flooding within an overall drying climate.

Botswana and Namibia already know all too well the challenges of droughts and floods. A few years ago, Botswana’s capital city Gaborone was on the brink of running out of water as the country battled its worst drought in 30 years. With its main dam running dry, parts of the city had no reliable water supply for weeks at a time. Neighbouring Namibia has battled with recurrent and devastating droughts and floods in recent years, especially in its northern regions, where most of the population live. In 2017, following four years of drought, heavy rainfall hit, causing flooding. Schools had to shut and people had to relocate. The spread of stagnant water caused a spike in cases of malaria.

With the prospect of worsening droughts, floods and other weather extremes on the horizon, the sooner southern African countries can prepare and implement adaptation strategies the better. The world is warming quickly. The Paris Agreement’s goal of limiting global warming to well below 2°C, ideally 1.5°C, by the turn of the century will be extremely challenging. To date, mitigation pledges by nations fall far short of what is needed, with global temperatures on track for a warming of 3.2°C by 2100. Under an increasing emissions trajectory, the 1.5°C threshold could be breached as early as the next decade, and the 2°C mark the decade after. This means there is an urgent need for countries like Botswana and Namibia to prepare and adapt — and do so quickly.

Seemingly small increases in global temperature can have serious local consequences

Our analysis of the impacts in Botswana and Namibia of 1.5°C, 2.0°C and higher levels of global warming shows that what seem like small increments in temperature at the global scale can have serious local consequences.

For Botswana and Namibia, 1.5°C of global warming would lead to an average temperature rise above the pre-industrial baseline in each country of 2.2°C and 2.0°C respectively. At 2.0°C global warming, Botswana would experience warming of 2.8°C. Namibia would warm by 2.7°C.

Changes in rainfall are also projected to shift. At 1.5°C of global warming, Botswana would receive 5 percent less annual rainfall, and Namibia 4 percent less. At 2.0°C global warming, annual rainfall in Botswana would drop by 9 percent, with annual rainfall in Namibia dropping by 7 percent.

Both countries would also see an increase in dry days. At global warming of 1.5°C, projections show Botswana having 10 more dry days per year. That number rises to 17 extra dry days at 2.0°C global warming. For Namibia, dry days increase by 12 at global warming of 1.5°C, and by 17 at 2.0°C. The impact of global warming on extreme events is also evident. Both countries can expect roughly 50 more days of heatwaves at 1.5°C global warming, and about 75 more heatwave days at 2.0°C global warming.

Tables show projected climate changes and impacts of 1.5°C, 2.0°C and higher global warming on Botswana and Namibia. Tables sourced from infographics available at the ASSAR website.

The impacts of higher global and local temperatures will be felt in various sectors key to the prosperity of people and economies in Botswana and Namibia. Understanding when different levels of warming will occur, and what these mean for threats to vulnerable sectors like agriculture, health and water, is crucial for adaptation planning and thinking about what must be done, and by when.

In a hotter, drier future there will be less domestic water available. Runoff in Botswana’s Limpopo catchment is projected to decline by 26 percent at 1.5℃ global warming, and by 36 percent at 2.0℃. In Namibia, evapotranspiration rates increase by 10 percent at 1.5℃ global warming and by 13 percent at 2.0℃, leading to reduced river flows and drier soils.

Agriculture is particularly vulnerable, with potential drops in crop yields and increased livestock losses. In Botswana, at 1.5℃ global warming maize yields could drop by over 20 percent. At 2.0℃ warming, yields could slump by 35 percent. Rain-fed agriculture is already marginal across much of the country, and anticipated climate change may well make current agricultural practices unviable at 1.5℃ and above. In Namibia, productivity of cereal crops is expected to drop by 5 percent at 1.5℃ and by 10 percent at 2.0℃.

The impacts of global warming on human health are also essential to consider. Since local temperatures in southern Africa will rise quicker than the global average, heat stress is projected to become an increasingly greater threat. At 1.5℃ of global warming, Namibia and Botswana can expect roughly 20 more days of heat stress exposure in a year. At 2.0℃, in Namibia this doubles to around 40 more days of heat stress exposure.

All of these impacts become even more severe should the 2.0℃ threshold be overshot. For example, at 2.5℃ global warming, Namibia’s groundwater recharge rates could drop by 70 percent and runoff into Botswana’s important Limpopo catchment could slump by almost half. At 3℃ of global warming, projections enter frightening territory: both countries could experience close to 150 extra days of heatwaves in a year.

Urgent action is needed

Global warming of 1.5℃ and higher will add to the climate adaptation challenges Namibia and Botswana already face with the 1.0°C warming experienced to date. The implications of what the near future holds for these countries demand concerted action, both locally and internationally. Leaders from countries such as Botswana and Namibia cannot let-up on the global stage in pushing for nation states to make good on, and further improve, their pledges to cut greenhouse gas emissions in line with the Paris Agreement. As the IPCC 1.5°C report shows, early and decisive action will not only reduce the risks of overshooting the Paris temperature targets, but also slow down the rates of change, making local adaptation easier to roll out.

But, given the lack of ambition in emission reductions so far, and the major energy and land-use transformations that IPCC report claims will be needed, highly exposed countries such as Namibia and Botswana need to anticipate and plan for quite rapid changes in the characteristics of local weather and climate. We need an acceleration in developing adaptation strategies for key vulnerabilities in a way that works for all people and across the economies of these countries. The time for pilot adaptation projects and experiments is over, and the moment to start mainstreaming climate resilience into public, private and community sectors has arrived.

In parallel, governments, scientists and development practitioners need to think longer term, to consider what overshooting the 1.5°C and 2°C targets really means for adaptation, with a view to understanding the limits to adapting current livelihood and economic systems. At some stage, adaptation of these systems may not be enough, and complete transformations to new livelihoods that are suitable in a 2°C+ world may be needed. These transformations are likely to be needed sooner in climate change ‘hotspots’ such as Namibia and Botswana.

Botswana, Libya, Eritrea the only African countries in the red-zone list

TEFO PHEAGE

As the country’s leadership continues to wrestle over water tenders, a newly-released world report has ranked Botswana among 17 high risk countries facing extremely high water stress. As a matter of fact, the report says Botswana is teetering close to “day zero” conditions when taps will run dry.

The Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas of the World Resources Institute ranked water stress, drought risk and riverine flood risk using a peer-reviewed methodology.

The group evaluated the water stress levels of 189 countries and the regions within them. The top 17 high risk countries are Qatar, Israel, Lebanon, Iran, Jordan, Libya, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Eritrea, the UAE, San Marino, Bahrain, India, Pakistan, Turkmenistan, Oman and Botswana.

In regions that face “extremely high” water stress like Botswana, industry, agriculture and municipalities are withdrawing at least 80% of available surface and groundwater each year. That puts them in a precarious position, with little leftover water to serve as a buffer in dry spells.

“Our populations and economies are growing and demanding more water, but our supply is threatened by climate change, by water waste, and by pollution,” Betsy Otto, director of WRI’s Global Water Programme, said. “Water stress, which occurs when demands rival annual supply, is a manifestation of those issues.”

The researchers behind the report say they expect to see more “day zeros,” the term for the moment when a city’s taps run dry as populations grow and continue to draw from dwindling water resources. In January 2018, Cape Town, South Africa got dangerously close to this reality. The government announced the city was three months from day zero and residents successfully limited their water use enough to make it to the next rain season,

“Water stress” is a comparison of supply and demand to measure water stress, WRI looked at the amount of water that gets withdrawn each year from the total supply of renewable, available water. (Withdrawal isn’t the same as water consumption since some withdrawn water is later returned to the source.)

The crisis comes at a time when the world is on track to warm by 1.5 degrees Celcius as early as 2013.That would increase the likelihood of extreme drought in the Mediterranean, reduce rainfall across Southern Africa, and cause longer and more frequent heat waves in many parts of the globe.

Preventing “day zeros”

Otto said better planning and water-management practices can help mitigate water crises. She suggested more water-efficient irrigation systems, better recycling of wastewater to water crops or use in industrial processes, and more simple infrastructure maintenance like fixing leaks.

To mitigate its situation, Botswana successfully approached the World Bank for a $145.5 million loan to for Emergency Water Security and Efficiency Project. “The project will help Botswana cope with increased water stress arising from a number of factors, including chronic drought,” said Paul Noumba Um, the World Bank Country Director. “The proposed measures are therefore critical for the sustainable development of the country, particularly given current climate change projections.”

The project was prepared in response to the 2015-2016 El-Nino related drought that was rated extremely severe – the worst in the last 34 years. Although droughts in Botswana are chronic, acute events such as the 2015-2017 drought further aggravate the fragile water balance.

In 2015, overall dam levels fell below 20 percent of their design capacity and groundwater sources in several water supply schemes dried up or became saline. The project was to improve the availability of water supply in drought vulnerable areas, strengthen wastewater management in selected systems and improve the operational efficiency of Water Utilities Corporation. The project was also to support the government’s ongoing efforts to integrate and manage surface and groundwater resources more effectively.

Around 460,000 people in select settlements were to benefit from augmentation or rehabilitation of existing water supply systems while about 177,000 were to benefit from improved wastewater treatment and sludge management systems. Targeted measures to interlink, protect and secure surface and groundwater resources would be undertaken and support for institutional strengthening and capacity development provided in order to improve the efficiency of services and sustainability of water resources in Botswana.

Five years down the line and still counting

But despite these efforts, the country’s dream of water security remains a pie in the sky from which no rain is coming. Success stories have been rather slow and the country’s water situation is defined by often dry taps and temporary and short -term mechanisms like rainwater harvesting from mainly tin roofs, raising issues of hygiene. But as the situation worsens, Parliament recently rejected a request for P900 million by the Ministry of Land Management, Water and Sanitation Services for a 100 kilometre water supply pipeline project in the midst of allegations of corruption in tendering.

Kenneth Matambo said the project was aimed at addressing shortages of water in centres of population in Greater Gaborone, namely in Mochudi, Molepolole, Thamaga, Moshupa, Kanye, Borolong and Ramotswa.","Country ranks among the “extremely high water stressed”Botswana, Libya, Eritrea the only African countries in the red-zone listTEFO PHEAGEAs the country’s leadership continues to wrestle over water tenders, a newly-released world report has ranked Botswana among 17 high risk countries facing extremely high water stress.

The department’s head of business, Thabo Ndadi, explained that seventy percent supply of water in and around Maun will be shut down to allow for maintenance of main water pipe to the area.

“This week we discovered that our main water pipe that brings in water from Kunyere boreholes has raptured and thus unable to adequately supply water,” explained Ndadi.

Ndadi further confirmed that they started noticing the leak last month but avoided tempering with it as it was during the lockdown and when the country had just reported first cases of the killer Covid-19 disease.

“Our hope and prayer was that the leak would not become so bad before the end of the COVID-19 state of emergency, but the water pressure has gone down and therefore we have to fix the problem and we cannot do it without temporarily cutting the flow,” added Ndadi.

Seventy percent of water supply in Maun is from boreholes along Kunyere river in Nxaraga area, while the other two boreholes in Shashe and Sexaxa make up the remaining thirty percent.

“This effectively means Maun will be running with a seventy percent water shortage and we are pleading with members of the community to use water with extra care,” Ndadi added.

In fact some areas will go dry for over 24 hours and WUC has advised people to store water for weekend use today because from tomorrow, taps will be completely dry. “Many other homes will get water way beyond the 24 hours, because after maintenance the water has to make a long journey to reach the taps, for some it will take 48 hours or so. In fact the whole recovery process takes seven days so, it may be practically impossible to complete the recovery within 24 hours.”

Meanwhile Thamalakane river has started to fill up, but the WUC water treatment plant in Borolong is yet to start pumping water from the river as they have to wait for at least a month for the water “to be of better quality to be processed for consumption. Right now the water volume is still low for such an exercise but the plant is ready to start operations. Already we have begun testing the water for quality and it not yet where we want it to be,” Ndadi said.","Most parts of Maun and surrounding areas are expected to experience a dry spell this weekend as the Water Utilities Corporation (WUC) cuts water supply for the next two days.

This is according to Botswana Environment Statistics – Human Settlements Report for 2018, which was only made public this week.

It is stated that in 2017, around 73 percent of households in towns and urban villages had access to a piped water source. This figure is considerably lower in rural villages, with just 27 percent of households reporting access to a tapped water source.

Additionally, from 2011 to 2017 the proportion of total households with access to improved water source through tapped or piped water dropped from 90.6 to 82.5.

Meanwhile, in terms of energy source, it was observed that over the six-year period, electricity usage increased noticeably in both urban areas and rural villages.

Usage rose from 69.1 percent to 84.6 percent in urban areas and from 23.9 percent to 35.4 percent in rural areas.

During the same period, it was further noted that paraffin, previously used as a source of lighting in rural areas, experienced a decrease while electricity became a leading source of power

Meanwhile, the same report has found that households living in shacks increased significantly from 1.21 percent in 1991 to 2.22 percent in 2017, a development described as a cause for concern.

The report says this implies that more households are at a high risk of contracting communicable diseases. In turn, the report warns this will become a burden for the economy.

According to the report, it has been observed that generally households occupying shacks in rural areas experienced a slight increase during the period under review despite a transformation from traditional to modern type of housing.

Notably, households occupying shacks in urban areas decreased from 1.4 percent in 1991 to 1.3 percent in 2001 and further dropped from 0.7 percent in 2011 to 0.4 percent in 2017.","While there has been an increase in the number of households with access to tap water in towns and urban villages, the opposite is true in rural villages.

Fossil Water in Libya

Libya is an arid nation, mostly desert, in which freshwater is perpetually scarce. Rainfall is meager—only five percent of the nation receives more than 100mm of rain each year. Libya has long relied on groundwater reserves to quench its thirst; but surging demand has stressed supply, and many coastal groundwater aquifers have become brackish with an influx of seawater.

In the mid-1950s, oil exploration in the nation’s vast southern desert revealed a precious resource and a potential solution—fossil water.

Deep under the Sahara sands, ancient aquifers have been storing 40,000-year-old reserves of pure drinking water.

The groundwater was put in place during ancient eras of dramatically different climates and became encapsulated through geological changes. Like the fossil fuels that were also created under long-vanished conditions, this “fossil water” is a non-renewable resource with great potential.

To bring this ancient, remote water to Libya’s people the government launched The Great Man-Made River Project—a water management scheme of enormous scope. The project is a network of pipes and reservoirs that move water from its subterranean desert origins and delivers it to the country’s heavily-populated coastal region at a total estimated cost in excess of $20 billion (U.S.).

Financed by oil revenue, the project began in 1984. Construction continues today—but the Great Man-Made River Project has already had a dramatic impact in the many coastal cities now serviced by water from the nation’s ancient reserves. The system is designed to pump water from some 1,300 desert wells and move 6.5 million cubic meters of it every day. Already, 4,000 km (2,485 miles) of 4-meter-diameter pipeline is transporting water to faucets in Libyan homes.

The design life of the project is 50 years, but the actual life will depend greatly on the pumping rates. In the end, no one knows for certain how much water remains and this source is non-renewable—when it’s gone it’s gone. With so much invested in development of this precious resource, efficient use will be Libya’s key to making every drop count.","Libya has long relied on groundwater reserves to quench its thirst; but surging demand has stressed supply, and many coastal groundwater aquifers have become brackish with an influx of seawater.

Tripoli is thirsty. Valves are increasingly running empty and load shedding is increasing. The cuts highlight the territorial fragmentation of the country.

In the land of black gold, water no longer flows. Since the beginning of the summer, the Libyan capital has experienced no less than five major water cuts. The first one on May 20, at dawn. As the city wakes up, #WaterlessTripoli is gaining momentum on Twitter.

“How do I explain to my family that they have to go to the mosque to wash?” asked one angry social media user. These interruptions are in addition to frequent power outages. At the end of July, when the mercury hit over 35°C and most parts of the capital had to cope with just three hours of electricity a day, Tripoli’s taps ran empty for several days.

Political leverage

Admittedly, the front line is dozens of kilometres from the centre of the capital, which has been besieged by the Libyan National Army (LNA) of Khalifa Haftar since 4 April. But the resource war has invaded Tripolitan homes. In fact, the problem has been endemic since 2011, due to the inevitable degradation of infrastructure. “Foreign technicians no longer dare to set foot here for security reasons, and all modernization contracts – such as the project to build three desalination plants between Tripoli and Misrata – remain blocked despite the huge investment opportunities,” says Farraj al-Amari, former Director of Planning at Tripoli’s Ministry of Electricity and Water.

The collateral damage of the Libyan security situation is not solely to blame. National resources are also one of the central issues in the civil conflict. Their poor management crystallizes the tensions of a country, divided between clans and tribal groups, that has never made peace with its past.

“Since 2011, and especially during periods of war, water and electricity resources have been a political lever. Armed groups know this. And they exploit it for community or personal claims,” explains Lazib Mohamed Essaïd, a doctoral student at the French Institute of Geopolitics and an expert on Libya. In Tripolitania, controlling access to water and electricity is a powerful means of applying pressure against an increasingly inoperative government.

Collective punishment

In some cases, the cuts are similar to a collective sanction for the inhabitants. This is precisely what happened in May, when a pro-Gaddafi militia, now affiliated with Marshal Khalifa Haftar, voluntarily closed the Jabal al-Hasawna pumping station in the southwest of the country, blocking one of the networks serving the capital. The sabotage organized by Khalifa Hanaish, who heads the armed group, had a specific objective: to obtain the release of his brother, a military leader detained by a rival militia from Tripoli.

The capital, like other cities from the coast to Benghazi, is 95% dependent on water pumped in the south of the country, where the Nubian Basin is located, a water table shared by Libya, Egypt, Sudan and Chad. Discovered in 1953 during an oil exploration campaign, this underground basin was exploited by Muammar Gaddafi to carry water from the desert to the coast via the Great Man-Made River, the largest irrigation project in the world.

Some 4,000 kilometres of underground pipelines pass through these tribal territories to the cities. For Jalel Harchaoui, a researcher at the Clingendael Institute in The Hague and a specialist on Libya, “we can observe the enormous paradox between a very marginalized but resource-rich Fezzan and a capital that has totally abandoned it when it depends on it completely”.

“Potential war crimes”

Since 2017, the LNA has made several attempts to advance southwest before turning north. In February, Khalifa Haftar finally managed to seize this strategic area, claiming its resources. “It is no coincidence that, in his progress, the Marshal followed the route of the main oil fields. The area corresponds to the area where the GMR [Great Man-Made River] extends,” notes analyst Djidel Hocine.

Consequently, the Government of National Understanding (GNA) of Fayez al-Sarraj, attributed deliberate water cuts to the Eastern Marshal, accusing him of causing a humanitarian crisis in the besieged enclave. “This summer, groups allied to Haftar in the southern part of the capital intentionally targeted water stations at least twice,” points Abdelkader Lahouili, a member of the Tripoli State High Council.

A United Nations press release has clearly described these as “attacks” and “potential war crimes” against civilians but stopped short of naming a perpetrator.

For their part, the LNA denies any involvement. Is Khalifa Haftar denying water to the population to win the battle? “He would have the means to do so, but the international community is watching him. Haftar still has a lot to lose in diplomatic matters. At the moment, he cannot afford to be likened to a war criminal,” says Jalel Harchaoui.

Political dividends for Haftar?

If the marshal is not directly involved in these sabotage operations, he seems to tolerate them when they are the work of local forces that support him. Any dysfunction in Tripoli works in his favour: a deterioration of the security situation, water and electricity cuts and poor infrastructure management. All of it fuels the frustration of a population deprived of essential goods.

As Abdelkader Lahouili confirms, “the situation has deteriorated with the war. The companies that manage the power plants around the capital are Turkish [Turkey supports the Tripoli government]. Technicians become a target, and the government can no longer access these areas. At the moment, the security issue remains a priority,”.

But in the long term, Haftar may well recover the political dividends of this situation. For Jalel Harchaoui, “the war is not progressing as the Eastern Marshal wished. If the GNA were to fall because the population rejects it, it would give [Haftar] a huge advantage”.

Interruptions to water supplies are common after eight years of near-anarchy since Muammar Gaddafi was ousted, but a wider crisis is now coming to a head in a country made up mainly of arid desert and split between competing administrations.

In western Libya, finding clean water has become difficult because both the power grid and water control system have been damaged in an offensive by forces loyal to eastern-based Khalifa Haftar on Tripoli, where the U.N.-backed government is based.

“Drinkable water is a daily issue for my family,” said Usama Mohamed Dokali, a cashier in a cafe in Tripoli, who buys bottled water when he can and gets it from a charity when his money runs out. Other people fill bottles from wells and hope for the best.

Looting and neglect have made the situation fragile and armed groups have exploited the unrest. In May, gunmen pressing officials to release a detained relative forced water workers to turn off supplies to all of Tripoli for two days.

The United Nations has warned all sides that water should not become a weapon of war, but the water system is already badly damaged in western Libya where the capital is located, according to unpublished reports by the water authority and the United Nations Childrens’ Agency.

Even local bottled water in a country which sits on Africa’s biggest proven oil reserves has become contaminated.

If the damage does not get fixed, there could be a “sudden, unexpected, uncontrollable and un-prepared for” shutdown of the main water pipeline system, the water authority said in a March presentation to international organizations seen by Reuters.

“The consequences will be catastrophic as there is no viable alternative water supply system,” it said.

That warning of a possible systematic failure, echoed in a draft UNICEF report the same month, is the most dramatic sign of a collapse of state services in what was once one of North Africa’s richest countries.

It would have far-reaching consequences in a country where lawlessness is being exploited again by Islamist militants, armed groups and people promising to smuggle African migrants and refugees to Europe.

“An estimated 4 million people would be deprived of access to safe water,” UNICEF Libya spokesman Mostafa Omar said by email, listing cholera, hepatitis A and diarrhea, a major childhood killer, as the likely result.

“GREAT MAN MADE RIVER”

Poor public services were one of the drivers of the uprising against Gaddafi, but a 4,000 km (2,485-mile) pipeline system known as the Great Man Made River (MMRP) was a world-leading civil engineering project when it was built in the 1980s.

Some 80 percent of the population of six million live along or near the northern Mediterranean coast and depend on fresh water pumped via its pipelines from vast aquifers further south, where Libya’s abundant oil reserves also lie.

Ground water in coastal areas is salty and contaminated by sewage and around 80 percent of desalination plants have broken down, water authority officials and diplomats say.

The pipes supply Libya with more than 70 percent of its fresh water and remain crucial because desalination plants are complicated to fix and vulnerable to attack, officials at the United Nations’ children’s agency say.

People dismantle well heads to sell the copper and tribesmen living in the neglected south close or destroy pipes to press their demands with officials in the capital.

As a result, 101 of 479 wells on the western pipeline system have been dismantled, Abdullah El-Sunni, head of the Tripoli-based water authority said in an interview with Reuters. Asked if there could be a water crisis, he said power cuts were already threatening supplies.

Since the central monitoring room of the pipeline system for western Libya was hit around early May, engineers have been unable to gauge water pressure and flows. A Tunisian maintenance firm working on the system left because of the fighting.

“The water flow to Western Libya has dropped from the normal flow of 1.2 million cubic meters per day to about 800,000 cubic meters per day now, due to sabotage and lack of funding and maintenance,” Sunni said.

Across Libya, demand has risen to 7 billion cubic meters annually, up from 5.5 billion in 2011, as farmers and others have drilled wells or tapped reservoirs, Sunni said. By 2025, Libya will need 8 billion.

The draft UNICEF report, which has yet to be finalised, listed kidnapping of water workers and looting of equipment among many problems.

In May, gunmen pressing officials to release a detained relative forced water workers to turn off supplies to all of Tripoli - a short-lived halt that led the United Nations to warn all sides that water should not become a weapon of war.

“If not addressed properly and immediately, these threats and damages could lead to the complete failure of the MMRP,” it said.

Sunni said water quality had been affected by a lack of treatment, due to a shortage of funds for chemicals and equipment, and some officials agree with residents who say water in the taps is not fit to drink.

“All water is contaminated,” said Badr al-Din al-Najjar, head of the National Center for Disease Control, listing problems such as harmful bacteria or a high-salt content. “There is no drinking water, especially from the state.”

The problem has been building since Gaddafi’s overthrow, when officials stopped investing in facilities that had been looted, damaged or allowed to deteriorate in the chaos.

Libya sits on Africa’s biggest proven oil reserves and is pumping the highest volumes of crude since 2013.

But the $34 billion budget is mainly used to pay armed groups, an overstaffed public service and fuel subsidies or is simply stolen, diplomats say and some Libyan officials admit. The government says it is committed to fighting corruption and its economic reforms have helped.

Haftar, a former Gaddafi-era military commander, is allied to a parallel administration which has hired thousands of employees and fighters.

In Tripoli, Prime Minister Fayez al-Serraj’s U.N.-backed government has brought some order but armed groups have forced the state to give them and their partners jobs or contracts.

Sunni said water infrastructure needed 2 billion dinars ($1.4 billion) of investment but his authority got 60 million dinars last year and nothing yet this year due to the war.

Serraj said in an interview that funding for Libya’s development and basic services had to be diverted to equip troops and treat the wounded.

While instability since 2011 has eroded living standards, with GDP of around $7,235 per capita, Libya is still an upper middle income country, according to the World Bank.

But it now depends on the U.N. and other international organizations for a multitude of services, including building water tanks for the one-in-five schools without piped water.

“Libya and Tripoli have been without water for many, many hours for two months...so how can children wash?” said Abdel-Rahman Ghandour, Libya Special Representative of UNICEF.

The agency also carries out basic childhood vaccinations and the United Nations and other international bodies provide food for displaced people and even medical kits to state hospitals to treat civilians and fighters on both sides of the frontline.

“The health system is about to collapse,” Najjar said.

Authorities have banned swimming in the Mediterranean in and around Tripoli because sewage gets pumped unfiltered in to the sea. With homes deprived of air conditioning by power cuts, people crowd the beaches nonetheless.","People fill gallons with water during a water shortage in Tripoli, Libya June 13, 2019.

Nader Mohamed, a taxi driver and father of three in Tripoli, said the situation had grown much worse. He lives on the fifth floor and must carry the family water supply up to their flat each morning.

They cannot afford a private generator and he sits in the evenings with candles, telling the children stories from memory.

“Besides the war, we now suffer from a virus, and if it spreads, God only knows what will happen,” he said.

The latest surge in warfare since mid-March has shown no signs of slackening, with fighting and bombardment on several fronts, but no decisive gains by either side.

Libya’s main split is between the eastern-based Libyan National Army (LNA) of Khalifa Haftar and the internationally recognised Government of National Accord (GNA), which holds the capital Tripoli and some other parts of the northwest.

The LNA, backed by the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Russia, has set up a parallel administration in Benghazi, in the east, and launched an offensive a year ago to capture Tripoli frequently bombarding the capital.

The escalation is in defiance of pleas from the United Nations and international aid agencies to cease fire to allow Libya’s war-tattered health system to prepare for the coronavirus, with 21 cases confirmed across the country.

On Monday, projectiles struck al-Khadra hospital in Abu Salim, an area held by the GNA near a frontline, causing damage and prompting the U.N. humanitarian coordinator to denounce “a clear violation of international humanitarian law”.

Turkish-supplied drones have in recent days targeted LNA supply lines, both sides have said, striking trucks. On Sunday they targeted a plane, which the GNA said was carrying arms and the LNA said was carrying medical supplies.

Drone use “changed the balance”, GNA deputy defence minister Salahedin Ali Namroush said in a phone interview. The drones were being used to target “especially the supply lines,” he added.

The electricity company said a technical fault was behind intermittent supply on Tuesday and Wednesday, while the water provider, the Great Man Made River Project, said on Facebook that gunmen stormed a control room on Tuesday, cutting the flow.

“The situation is miserable.

Libya’s water problems have become common during eight years of unrest following the ouster of former leader Muammar Gaddafi.

Even before the unrest, Libya suffered from low water supplies. The country sits in a desert with low rainfall but has high water demand for use in agriculture and industry.

But current fighting between warring forces seeking control of the capital, Tripoli, is causing a wider water crisis.

The battles involve forces sent by two competing administrations seeking to take control of all Libya. One side is led by the internationally recognized government in the west, known as the Government of National Accord. The other, in the east, is led by Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar, who heads the Libyan National Army.

Fighting broke out in early April, when Haftar declared he would take the western part of Tripoli by force, and unite the country under his group. Forces supporting the Government of National Accord are fighting against the attacks, with neither side showing signs of giving up.

In western Libya, finding clean water has become difficult because both the power and water control systems have been heavily damaged.

Usama Mohamed Dokali is a restaurant worker in Tripoli. He told the Reuters news service that the water shortage has been worsening.

“Drinkable water is a daily issue for my family.” He added that he buys bottled water when he can and sometimes gets water from an aid group when he has no more money. Other people fill bottles from wells and hope for the best.

Continued fighting and looting have made the situation worse. Armed groups have even used water as a weapon of war. In May, gunmen pressing officials to release a detained relative forced water workers to turn off supplies to all of Tripoli for two days.

The United Nations has warned all sides that water should not become a weapon of war. But the water system is already badly damaged in western Libya, Reuters reported. The news service said the information was based on unpublished reports by local water officials and the United Nations Children’s Agency, or UNICEF.

Even local bottled water has become polluted, Reuters reported.

Libyan water officials warned of the dangers of water shortages during a presentation in March to international organizations. If the damage does not get fixed, there could be a “sudden, unexpected, uncontrollable and un-prepared for” shutdown of the main water pipeline system, the officials said. They warned of “catastrophic” results if this happens because no backup water supply system exists.

“An estimated 4 million people would be deprived of access to safe water,” UNICEF Libya spokesman Mostafa Omar told Reuters. He warned that such a crisis would likely increase the spread of diseases like cholera, hepatitis A and diarrhea.

The United Nations humanitarian coordinator for Libya has condemned the cutting off of water supply to the capital Tripoli over the past week as “particularly reprehensible” and said it must stop immediately.

An armed group on Monday stormed a control station at Shwerif, stopping water from being pumped and threatening workers, the Great Man-Made River Project, which supplies water to much of Libya, said in a statement.

The armed group is seeking to use the water cutoff as pressure to force the release of detained family members, UN humanitarian coordinator Yacoub El Hillo said in a statement on Friday.

The supply has been cut to more than two million people in Tripoli and nearby towns and cities.

Tripoli, seat of the internationally recognised Government of National Accord (GNA), has been under assault for a year by the eastern-based Libyan National Army of Khalifa Haftar.

An escalation in fighting since mid-March has involved intense bombardment, particularly in the south of the city near the front lines, with projectiles hitting a hospital.

The warfare has hindered efforts to prepare Libya’s already tattered health system for an outbreak of the coronavirus, with 24 cases confirmed in the country. State efforts to slow the spread of the disease have included a curfew.

Electricity supply has also been repeatedly cut in Tripoli and some other areas over the past week.

“At this moment when Libya is fighting the threats of the COVID-19 pandemic, access to water and electricity is more than ever life-saving, and such individual acts to collectively punish millions of innocent people are abhorrent and must stop immediately,” Hillo said.","Supply has been cut to more than two million people in Tripoli and nearby towns following an attack on Monday.

In October 2001, the Great Man-Made River Authority (GMRA) awarded an $82m contract for the construction of major new pumping facilities to a consortium led by Frankenthal KSB Fluid Systems. In January of the following year, the Nippon Koei / Halcrow consortium was selected to provide the preliminary engineering and design works for phase III of the operation, worth $15.5m.

The pumping station was completed and KSB was subsequently responsible for servicing the plant and providing technical support for one year after completion.

In phase III, an additional 1,200km of pipelines were laid, which ultimately increased the total daily supply capacity of the existing system to 3.68 million cubic metres and provided a further 138,000 cubic metres a day to Tobruk and the coast. Phase III was completed by 2009.

On 22 July 2011 Nato warplanes attacked a pipe making plant at Brega killing six of the facility’s security guards. Nato claimed that the building had been used as a military storage facility and rockets were launched from there by pro-Gadaffi troops.

The attack came shortly after Libya warned that Nato-led air strikes could cause a ""human and environmental disaster"" if air strikes damaged the Great Man-Made River project. Reports indicate that damage to infrastructure was not serious enough to completely stop the river from running.

Background to Libya’s GMR water project

Related project New Cairo Wastewater Treatment Plant, Egypt New Cairo Wastewater Treatment Plant is the first public-private partnership (PPP) project in Egypt.

In 1953, the search for new oilfields in the deserts of southern Libya led to the discovery not just of significant oil reserves, but also vast quantities of fresh water trapped in the underlying strata. Most of this water was collected between 38,000 and 14,000 years ago, though some pockets are only 7,000 years old.

There are four major underground basins. The Kufra basin, lying in the south-east, near the Egyptian border, covers an area of 350,000 square kilometres, forming an aquifer layer more than 2,000m deep, with an estimated capacity of 20,000 square kilometres in the Libyan sector.

The 600m-deep aquifer in the Sirte basin is estimated to hold more than 10,000 square kilometres of water, while the 450,000 square kilometre Murzuk basin, south of Jabal Fezzan, is estimated to hold 4,800 square kilometres. More water lies in the Hamadah and Kufrah basins, which extend from the Qargaf Arch and Jabal Sawda to the coast.

The GMR project – the world’s largest engineering venture – is intended to transport water from these aquifers to the northern coastal belt, to provide for the country’s 5.6 million inhabitants and for irrigation. Intended to be the showpiece of the Libyan revolution, Colonel Muammar Gaddafi called it the ""eighth wonder of the world"".

First conceived in the late 1960s, the initial feasibility studies were conducted in 1974, with work starting ten years later. The project, which still has an estimated 25 years to run, was designed in five phases. Each one is largely separate in itself, but will eventually combine to form an integrated system.

Phases I and II of the African nation’s water supply project

""In 2001, the Great Man-Made River Authority (GMRA) awarded an $82m contract for the construction of major new pumping facilities to a consortium led by Frankenthal KSB Fluid Systems.""

The first and largest phase, providing two million cubic metres a day along a 1,200km pipeline from As-Safir and Tazerbo to Benghazi and Sirte, via the Ajdabiya reservoir, was formally inaugurated in August 1991. This was a massive undertaking, using a quarter of a million sections of concrete pipe, 2.5 million tons of cement, 13 million tons of aggregate, two million kilometres of pre-stressed wire and requiring 85 million cubic metres of excavation, for a finished cost of $14bn.

The Tazerbo wellfield consists of both production and piezometric observation wells and yields around one million cubic metres a day at a rate of 120L/s per well. Only 98 of the 108 production wells are used, with the others on stand-by.

A collection network conveys the water to a 170,000 cubic metre off-line steel header tank. From here, the main conveyance system is routed 256km to the north, to two similar header tanks at Sarir, where the second phase I wellfield is located. A further one million cubic metres are produced here, using 114 of the 126 production wells, at an average flow rate of 102L/s per well. The wells at both Tazerbo and Sarir are about 450m deep and are equipped with submersible pumps at a depth of 145m.

From Sarir, two parallel, four metre-diameter pipelines convey the now chlorine-treated water to the four million cubic metre Ajdabiya holding reservoir, 380km to the north. The water flows from this 900m-diameter reservoir through two pipelines, one heading west to Sirte and the other north to Benghazi.

Each pipeline discharges into a circular earth embankment end reservoir, with a storage capacity of 6.8 million cubic metres at Sirte and 4.7 million cubic metres at Benghazi, which have been designed to balance fluctuations in supply and demand. In addition, large reservoirs – 37 million cubic metres in the Sirte area and 76 million cubic metres in Benghazi – have been built to act as storage facilities for summer or drought conditions.

Phase II delivers one million cubic metres a day from the Fezzan region to the fertile Jeffara Plain on the western coastal belt, as well as supplying Tripoli. The system starts at a wellfield at Sarir Qattusah, consisting of 127 wells distributed along three east-west collector pipelines, ultimately feeding a 28 million cubic metre terminal reservoir at Souk El Ahad.

Phase III of the Great Man-Made River Authority’s plan

Phase III was divided into two main parts. Firstly, it provided the planned expansion of the existing phase I system, adding an additional 1.68 million cubic metres a day, along with 700km of new pipelines and new pumping stations to produce a final total capacity to 3.68 million cubic metres a day.

""In phase III, an additional 1,200km of pipeline was laid. Phase III was completed by 2009.""

Secondly, it supplied Tobruk and the coast from a new wellfield at Al Jaghboub. This required the construction of a reservoir south of Tobruk and the laying of a further 500km of pipeline.

The preliminary engineering and design contract runs for 41 months and includes geotechnical and topographical surveys.

Conceptual design phases feature extensive consideration of pipeline routing and profiling, hydraulics, pumping stations, M&E, control / communications systems, reservoirs and other structures, corrosion control, power, operational support and maintenance provision. Evaluation of tenders for the detailed design was completed in the first quarter of 2005.

The last two phases of the project involved extending the distribution network together with the construction of a pipeline linking the Ajdabiya reservoir to Tobruk, and finally the connection at Sirte of the eastern and western systems into a single network.

When completed, irrigation water from the GMR will enable about 155,000ha of land to be cultivated – echoing the former Libyan leader’s original prediction that the project would make the desert as green as the country’s flag.

The GMR was originally conceived as having several arms, or phases, though not all have been built and some may never be. Nevertheless, since 1991 the project has supplied much-needed irrigation and drinking water to populous cities and farming areas in Libya’s north, which previously were dependent on desalination plants and on declining rain-fed aquifers near the coast.

Water was first discovered in the Al-Kufrah area in Libya’s southeastern desert in the 1950s during exploration drilling for oil. Subsequent analysis indicated that this find was part of the Nubian Sandstone Aquifer System, a vast reservoir of “fossil water” that is anywhere from 10,000 to 1,000,000 years old, water having percolated into the sandstone before the end of the last ice age, when the Saharan region enjoyed a temperate climate. Initially, the Libyan government planned to set up large-scale agricultural projects in the desert where the water was found, but plans were changed in the early 1980s, and designs were prepared for a massive network of pipelines to the coast.

In 1983 the Great Man-Made River Authority, established by the government to manage the project, awarded a contract for construction of the first arm, known as GMR 1 or Phase I. Hundreds of water wells were drilled at two fields, Tāzirbū and Sarīr, where water was pumped up from a depth of some 500 metres (1,650 feet). From Sarīr, water from both fields was pumped underground through a double pipeline to a holding reservoir at Ajdābiyā, which received its first water in 1989. From there the water was piped in two directions, west to the coastal city of Surt and north to Banghāzī. The completion of Phase I was formally celebrated at Banghāzī in 1991. GMR 1 is capable of transporting 2 million cubic metres (70.6 million cubic feet) of water per day through some 1,600 km (1,000 miles) of double pipeline between the well fields in the south and the destination cities in the north (though not all of that capacity is used).

A second system, GMR 2 or Phase II, located in western Libya, began supplying Libya’s capital, Tripoli, with drinking water in 1996. GMR 2 draws water from three well fields in the Jabal al-Ḥasāwinah region. From Qaṣr al-Shuwayrif one pipeline pumps water to Tarhūnah in the Nafūsah Plateau region, whence it flows by gravity to the Al-Jifārah Plain. Another pipeline goes north and east to the coast, where it turns west and supplies cities such as Miṣrātah and Al-Khums before ending at Tripoli. The system’s design capacity is 2.5 million cubic metres (roughly 90 million cubic feet) of water a day, though only a fraction of that is needed for drinking water.

When construction began on the GMR, it was described as the largest irrigation project in the world. (Indeed, the Libyan government proudly proclaimed it “the Eighth Wonder of the World.”) Some 70 percent of its capacity is intended to be used for agriculture, and from the beginning the project has included large-scale investments in irrigation infrastructure. The project also includes phases subsequent to GMR 1 and 2. These include an extension of the GMR 1 system southward to well fields in the Al-Kufrah region; a pipeline from wells near Ghadāmis in the western desert to the coastal cities of Al-Zāwiyah and Zuwārah, west of Tripoli; a pipeline connecting the GMR 1 and 2 systems; and a pipeline supplying Tobruk on the eastern coast, either from the existing reservoir at Ajdābiyā or directly from wells in the Al-Jaghbūb oasis. The total capacity of the GMR with all phases built would be some 6.5 million cubic metres (230 million cubic feet) of water per day. The complete network would include some 4,000 km (2,500 miles) of pipeline. Some Libyan officials, citing the enormous size of the underground reservoirs, have claimed that the reservoirs could continue to supply water for thousands of years. Critics have stated that such claims are greatly overstated; some insist that the GMR might not last through the 21st century.

The 250,000 sections of pipe laid in Phase I were said at the time to be the largest in the world, each having a diameter of 4 metres (13 feet) and a length of 7 metres (23 feet). Manufactured in two large factories located in Libya, the pipe was made up of layers of steel-reinforced prestressed concrete. The sections were laid in trenches 7 metres deep by specially built cranes and pushed into place by bulldozers, then the joints were sealed with giant rubber O-rings and cement grout, and the sections of trench were filled in. Open reservoirs located at distribution nodes such as Ajdābiyāh are man-made lakes excavated from the soil and rock and lined with asphalt. The largest reservoir, more than 1 km (0.6 mile) in diameter, holds as much as 24 million cubic metres (848 million cubic feet) of water. Numerous engineering companies from around the world have participated in the GMR project.","Libya's Great Man-Made River Existing and projected pipelines of Libya's Great Man-Made River irrigation project.

“The crisis of halting water supplies has ended and flows have started,” the Great Man-Made River company, a pipe network supplying ground water from the Sahara, said in a statement.

On Sunday, an armed group had stormed a pumping station run by the Great Man-Made River south of Tripoli, forcing employees to shut down water pipes connected to underground wells. The pipes supplied water to Tripoli, a city of more than 2 million people, and other coastal areas.

Forces loyal to the warlord Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar have been besieging Tripoli since 4 April in an attempt to take it from the UN-backed government of national accord (GNA). Their offensive, which has the tacit support of countries including the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Egypt, is one of the most serious flare-ups in fighting since Muammar Gaddhafi was deposed in 2011.

The UN special envoy, Ghassan Salame, warned the UN Security Council that if the international community did not stop arms shipments to Libyan factions and demand an immediate ceasefire, it risked the partition of the country and further regional instability.

“I am no Cassandra, but the violence on the outskirts of Tripoli is just the start of a long and bloody war on the southern shores of the Mediterranean, imperilling the security of Libya’s immediate neighbours and the wider Mediterranean region.”

He warned many Libyans were starting to resign themselves to the possibility of a civil war lasting months or years and arms shipments to warring parties were feeding a proxy war. “Arms are pouring again to both sides,” he said.

The group who closed off the water supplies claimed to be supporters of Haftar the leader of the Libyan National Army (LNA), but the link has been disputed. There were claims the armed group was operating independently and that the GNA was making a link to undermine support for the controversial general.

It is generally accepted that the LNA’s plans for a quick victory and the defeat of the GNA have been thwarted.

The agency that oversees the water project, first commissioned by the former Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi, insisted it had never taken sides in the current civil strife and said water supplies should never be used to pursue any interest. “Water is God’s gift to all and should not be used to dictate or bargain under any conditions at all,” the authority said.

As a result of the attack, water was cut not just to Tripoli but also to Gharyan and some other western mountain cities. Supplies to residents were not immediately halted because the water system holds two days of capacity.

The incident underlined the vulnerability of Libya’s civil fabric to a prolonged war. The authority previously warned it was finding it difficult to repair leaks because of the fighting. Libya periodically suffers from water outages.

The GNA accused the armed group of seeking to “lock the water from the capital to lower the morale of its inhabitants”.

The episode may rebound badly on Haftar as he seeks to persuade the international community he can be the upholder of security against the criminal militias who have afflicted the weak GNA government in Tripoli. It will also add to the sense that the siege is deepening a general lawlessness in Libya that others, including Islamic State, are beginning to exploit. There have been a number of Isis hit-and-run attacks in the past month, mainly in the south of the country.

The east and west of Libya have been divided for much of the time since Gaddafi was ousted with the help of Nato-backed forces in 2011.

","Water supplies to the Libyan capital and surrounding cities have been restored two days after they were cut off when an armed group stormed a control room, averting shortages that could have caused a humanitarian crisis.
“The crisis of halting water supplies has ended and flows have started,” the Great Man-Made River company, a pipe network supplying ground water from the Sahara, said in a statement.
The pipes supplied water to Tripoli, a city of more than 2 million people, and other coastal areas.

More than 2 million people were affected by the water cuts when a group in the southern town of Shwerif closed the main water pipeline to western Libya as part of an ongoing dispute over the disappearance of a close relative of the group. The water supply is progressively being established in the affected areas since Monday.

Joining the efforts of the United Nations Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL), the Government of Italy, local tribal elders and other organisations, the Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue (HD) intervened directly with the individuals carrying out the blockade in an attempt to resolve the dispute peacefully.

This blockade came at a time of growing conflict and humanitarian crisis in the country, amidst the persistent violent clashes throughout Western Libya which have led to greater civilian casualties and hindered efforts to counter the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.

HD’s current efforts in the country align with its recent support of the Call for Unity in Libya to combat the Coronavirus. Access to water is paramount in the country’s combat against the pandemic. The agreement that was reached remains fragile. HD will therefore continue to explore more permanent solutions to prevent future disruptions of the water supply and avoid a humanitarian catastrophe from developing. HD calls on all parties to preserve Libya’s sovereign institutions, including the water, electricity and oil systems, from the ongoing fighting and political disputes.

HD would like to thank the people of Shwerif and all those who are supporting a peaceful resolution to this ongoing dispute.

Water from the aquifer is in high demand for potable and irrigation use in particular. In addition to gradual groundwater table decrease with depletion, there are risks linked to groundwater quantity and quality owing to shortcomings in wastewater management and irrigation drainage waters as well as oil and gas exploration.

The challenges of ensuring the sustainable use of the region’s water resources, common to the aquifer sharing countries of Algeria, Libya and Tunisia, were the focus of a workshop this week organized by UNECE, Global Water Partnership Mediterranean and the Sahara and Sahel Observatory, with the effective participation of the Coordination Mechanism of the NWSAS. The workshop is part of an ongoing process for enhancing transboundary cooperation for the management of the NWSAS and strengthening related capacities.

More than 50 participants from the three countries representing the energy and agriculture sectors, water authorities and utilities, as well as environmental protection organizations, gathered in Algiers for the two-day event. The workshop provided a timely opportunity to assess the current and future management of the aquifer at national and transboundary levels, including sectoral policies in the three countries. Participants identified interlinkages among strategies and plans, laying the basis for strengthened cooperation by outlining a range of beneficial management, policy and infrastructure related actions that could be taken.

In his opening, Mr. Tahar Aichaoui, Director at the Department of Hydraulic Studies and Development, representing the Algerian Ministry of Water Resources, recalled the challenges to sustainability resulting from the close linkages (the “nexus”) between water, energy and food. He underlined in particular the question of food security, which is increasingly at risk due to climate change and predicted increases in the occurrence of hydrological extremes, calling for rationalizing water use and improving efficiency in irrigation. Currently, the region is also planning significant renewable energy development (solar power in particular), with different motivations, including the diversification of energy sources and reducing dependency on imports. The “nexus assessment” which has been initiated seeks to systematically analyse these trends and opportunities, and to bring authorities and stakeholders responsible for these natural resources around the table for dialogue.

The workshop participants urgently called for up-to-date monitoring of available water resources, applying demand management measures (including through appropriate pricing), reorienting economic development towards higher value production that does not require abundant water supply, and revisiting tarification. The potential of renewable energy to power the pumping and treatment of water was also recognized, together with questions related to environmental considerations and the water needs of energy generation. Participants further anticipated the need for significant investment in the modernization and extension of infrastructure in order to respond to the challenges identified.

Revisiting and empowering the Coordination Mechanism on the NWSAS was also among the opportunities identified during the workshop, which could be informed by the forthcoming intersectoral study being prepared by the workshop’s organizing partners.

The workshop also provided an occasion for stakeholders to learn more about strengthening cooperation through UNECE’s Convention on the Protection and Use of Transboundary Watercourses and International Lakes (Water Convention). The Convention has been gaining interest in the water-scarce Middle East and North Africa region thanks to its opening for accession to all United Nations Member States in 2016. The Convention’s provisions emphasize cooperation through agreements and mandated institutions, which also support countries’ implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development by facilitating transboundary cooperation for water resources management.","Water from the aquifer is in high demand for potable and irrigation use in particular.

The shortage of drinking water could become critical in the next few years.

Adding to the current deterioration of the economic situation in Libya, the oil-rich country is now facing the threat of severe water shortages, which could further worsen the country's living conditions.



Suleiman Aboud, head of the information department at the Tripoli-based Libyan Ministry of Water Resources, told al-Araby al-Jadeed that Libya was expecting shortages as existing water resources face a variety of challenges.

The annual water shortage is estimated at 500 million cubic metres.

Aboud explained that the annual groundwater recharge in Libya is around 250 million cubic metres, while consumption is estimated at one billion cubic meters.



Libya's natural water resources are limited, as desert constitutes 90 percent of the country's total area of nearly 1.8 million square kilometres.



It has only rained twice in Libya in the past five years.



Water shortages



Groundwater expert Saad al-Din al-Gharyani told al-Araby that the annual water shortage is estimated at around 500 million cubic metres.



Gharyani believes the reasons behind the water shortage include the expansion of agricultural activity, especially with crops that need a large amount of water, as well as the low quality of irrigation systems and the amount of water wasted in agricultural production.



A 2010 government-led study showed that the country's per capita share of renewable water was less than the global average, and that the maximum annual amount of ground and surface water would not exceed four billion cubic metres by 2025, and nearly one billion for desalinated water.



The study divided water resources into conventional - ground and surface water - and unconventional, the ""Great Man-Made River"", desalinated water, wastewater treatment and cross-border water transfer.



Regarding the available water resources, 95 percent come from groundwater, 2.3 percent from surface water, 0.9 from desalination plants and 0.66 from wastewater treatment.



Alternate water sources



The study called for the need to reuse treated wastewater, noting that the designed capacities can take up to 450,000 cubic metres, while operational capacities only produce about 150,000 cubic metres per day.



On the import of water, the study offered several options, including from Turkey and Gabon. In 2011, Libya sought to import water from the Turkish Manavgat River to Tobruk through three carriers. The first batch was agreed to be free of charge as an experiment for agricultural use.



The study also called for the reconsideration of investing in the Man-Made River, prioritising urban water supply to areas that do not have access to desalinated water, as well as the reconsideration of the priorities and percentages of water distribution.





Facilities to treat wastewater can take up to 450,000 cubic meters, but normally only about 150,000 cubic meters is treated per day.

Work started on the Man-Made River in 1983, and went on for 25 years, with a total cost estimated at some $30 billion. However, the water of the river is non-renewable, and will thus run out in 50 years.



The project transfers fresh water through large underground pipes, with a diameter of four metres each, extending from wells in the south-eastern oases of al-Kafra and al-Sarir and from the Fazzan Basin and Mount Hasawna in the south-west. The water then reaches northern cities with high population density.



Efforts by Muammar Gaddafi, who was overthrown in 2011, to connect the Man-Made River to African lakes, such as those in Congo and Chad, have failed.



In 2009, Libya sought to sign a number of contracts with European countries to use nuclear energy in several projects, including desalination plants, but no plans came to fruition.

485,https://borgenproject.org/unicef-schools-water-quality-in-libya/,UNICEF Focusing on Schools to Improve Water Quality in Libya,"Since the fall of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011, instability and conflict have continued in Libya. Unfortunately, the negative effects of this conflict are being felt most strongly among one of the most vulnerable groups in the country: children. The United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) reported in August 2017 that more than 500,000 children are in need of assistance due to the instability. With more than 200,000 of these children needing safe access to drinking water, UNICEF is focusing on improving water quality in Libya.

One specific area UNICEF has highlighted with regards to improving water quality in Libya is access to clean water in schools. A study completed by UNICEF, the Libyan National Center for Disease Control and the Libyan Ministry of Education in the first quarter of 2017 demonstrates why this focus is necessary.

Of 140 schools studied in the southern, eastern and western regions of the country, 54 percent had an insufficient and poor quality of drinking water and sanitation facilities. Through the study, UNICEF hopes that partners and other stakeholders will prioritize funds in order to spearhead water and sanitation programs across Libya.

Work has already begun to address the quality of water and sanitation facilities in schools. Through the Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) program, UNICEF and partners have improved water and sanitation facilities in 20 schools in two cities, Sebha and Ubari. The program also focused on 10 schools in Tripoli and schools in Benghazi during the time period.

This program has expanded to 32 more schools across Libya in 2017. UNICEF’s overall plan for Libya in 2017 calls for 95,000 people to gain access to clean drinking water and sanitation facilities.

While the focus on improving water quality in Libya and improving facilities in schools has grown, a number of obstacles will likely make these improvements a slow fix.

Security concerns continue to arise as conflicts continue in the country. Additionally, UNICEF has reported obstacles to cash transfers to the country.

Despite these obstacles, past results in the country should provide an optimistic outlook moving forward.

The country of Libya has suffered from civil war since the violent removal of its former dictator Muammar Ghadafi. Challenges with the country’s water supply was one of the many humanitarian problems that have arisen due to this conflict. Yet, even in darkness, there remains some light as one can see in the efforts to resolve the water crisis in Libya.

The Libyan Desert

In order to first understand how resolving the water crisis in Libya has taken place, it is important to understand the environmental qualities of Libya itself. The country is a dry and arid place and the presence of freshwater and rainfall is extremely scarce. However, Libya contains many groundwater aquifers, which offer available quantities of water underneath the ground.

The Water Crisis

The Libyan people have been tapping into this water supply to sustain life and plan on continuous aquifer use. Even with this underground supply, there has always been a struggle to ensure the availability of freshwater. This shortage of water does not mean that the aquifers are emptying, but rather that they are becoming contaminated by seawater intrusion. The extraction of freshwater has caused seawater to invade the aquifers. Due to the intrusion of seawater since the 1930s, it is alarming that no one knows exactly how much freshwater remains in the aquifers. Further, records have determined that seawater intrusion has compromised about 60 percent of freshwater wells. The freshwater in these aquifers cannot replenish either, meaning that every drop must count for use.

Another reason for the Libyan freshwater shortage is the expanding agricultural industry. Some crops demand vast amounts of water; typically this extensive use results in water waste throughout agricultural production and processing. In fact, Libya uses about 93 percent of its water for agricultural purposes.

Since Muammar Gaddafi’s ousting, a third strain has impacted water availability as a result of oil conflict. Gunmen forcing water-workers to turn off supplies in Tripoli for two days exacerbated this violence. Additionally, the country’s power grid and water control systems suffered damage due to fighting.

The Impact on Libyan People

These problems have adversely impacted the Libyan people. The country pumps about 6 percent of groundwater for drinking use and domestic wells. Drinkable water is a daily issue for the people of Libya; some local bottled water might even be unsafe. The fact that this small amount of water (6 percent) is not reaching people outlines the dire situation in Libya.

Some Libyans have resorted to looting their fellow countrymen and women in a desperate search for viable drinking water. According to UNICEF, these problems in the Libyan water supply have adversely impacted poor sanitation.

The Attempt Towards Resolution

As bleak as some of these problems appear, there are some attempts to solve the water crisis in Libya. The IHE Delft Institute for Water Education, for example, gives support and training to impoverished nations to better manage water resources. In 2018 IHE Delft reported training programs for Libyan governmental authorities in water management, water resources planning and water desalination. The IHE Delft training should allow Libya to accomplish the maintenance and management of the water supply in Libya effectively.

America has noticed the troubles the Libyan people have faced as well. In 2019, the U.S. government provided $31.3 million in aid to address the humanitarian needs of the country. With this aid, the Libyan people can fix the infrastructure including the damaged power grids and the water control systems.

Resolving the water crisis in Libya has been no easy task. Today, the country still struggles with the water supply. Although, victories due to the help of USAID and IHE Delft have been impactful achievements. These organizations have provided financial aid and programming to the Libyan government which is exactly the type of support necessary to formally resolve the water crisis in Libya.","Yet, even in darkness, there remains some light as one can see in the efforts to resolve the water crisis in Libya.

As a primarily desert country, Libya is a place where clean water is one of the most valuable commodities, used for agricultural production and human consumption. Increased levels of pollution from oil drilling and the salt water contamination of natural aquifers, however, have strained the water quality in Libya and made an already scarce water supply increasingly difficult to attain.

Rising sea levels and increased oil drilling have particularly plagued Libya and exposed its already limited and crucial water supply to pollutants and contamination.

Most of Libya’s water exists in naturally formed aquifers located underneath the country’s vast deserts. The only geographic area to receive more than 100 millimeters of rainfall a year is the coastal region, which accounts for less than 5 percent of Libya’s land area. Because of this, water purity is an increasingly crucial issue.

Since the 1950s, the sea level in Libya has advanced approximately one to two kilometers inland due to global warming and rising ocean levels. The slow move inward has caused a dramatic increase in the salinity of groundwater found in natural aquifers, from 150 parts per million in 1950 to 1,000 parts per million in 1990, according to Rajab M El-Asswad, a professor at Al-Fateh University Tripoli. As a direct consequence, the amount of water available and the water quality in Libya is becoming increasingly stretched.

In addition to limiting the amount of water that can be accessed, the increased salinity of seawater has made the overall process of obtaining water in Libya more expensive due to the need for desalination.

As aquifer water salinity and the need for water increases, the Libyan government must expand its desalinization processes. Unfortunately, desalinization is expensive and may require the diverting of funds necessary to help a nation develop.

Coinciding with the water pollution seen from natural causes like rising sea levels, man-made activities like oil drilling also creates pollution. The increase in standard drilling procedures and techniques such as fracking have exposed the vast natural aquifers to contaminants and chemicals, another negative effect on the water quality in Libya.

As the population of Libya continues to grow and the supply of water slowly declines, increased foreign aid funding becomes more important. Funds could be used to help complete the Great Manmade River Project, which aims to install hydraulic equipment necessary to withdraw and transport water from beneath the desert to high population centers for consumption and agricultural purposes.

Clean water is essential for life and agricultural growth and is necessary for a healthy ecosystem. The issue of water pollution in Libya has devastating effects on the country’s people and ecosystems and is a cause deserving of increased foreign aid.

In 1953 the search for oil in the deserts of southern Libya led to the discovery not only of significant oil reserves, but also vast quantities of freshwater trapped in aquifers under the Libyan desert. The Nubian Sandstone Aquifer System, the world's largest, is located under the eastern part of the Sahara desert and spans the political boundaries of Libya, Chad, Sudan and Egypt. It covers an area of just over 2m square km and contains an estimated 150,000 cubic km of groundwater.

Much of Libya's water supply used to come from expensive desalination plants on the coast, which left little water to irrigate land—vital in this largely desert country. Moreover the coastal aquifer historically used in Tripoli was becoming contaminated and its salinity was increasing. So in 1983 a massive engineering project, known as the Great Man-Made River Project, was created to supply water from desert aquifers to the coastal region for the majority of the Libya's 6.3m people and to expand agriculture through irrigation.

The project, of which three phases out of five have been completed, is intended to supply 6.5m cubic metres of water a day through 4,000km of pipelines from 1,100 wells via five reservoirs at an estimated cost of $25 billion. The cost of this non-renewable water is approximately one tenth of the cost of desalinated water.","LIBYA is one of the driest countries in the world, with only the narrow coastal region (less than 5% of the country) getting more than 100mm of rain a year.

489,https://atalayar.com/en/blog/water-libyas-liquid-gold,"Water, Libya's liquid gold","The emergence of the first truly global pandemic has plunged us into a deep, bad sleep, from which we are not yet quite sure how to escape. Human beings tend to take mental shortcuts in order to simplify problems whose complexity puzzles us, and that is why we have resorted to the use of war rhetoric in order to believe that this way we can better understand an overwhelming situation. Terms such as ""enemy"", ""shield"", ""war"", ""trench"" and ""victory"" have been used profusely to thread together a sensationalist rhetoric, which has put lyrics to the imposition of exceptional measures, focused on the here and now, which have left the future for a better occasion, and which risk throwing the baby out with the bathwater. The truth is that - to paraphrase the Guatemalan writer Augusto Monterroso - when we wake up, the old problems, the proverbial dinosaur in his story, will still be here. And they will also be accompanied by new ones, however much we may feel that the past, present and future have suddenly ceased to have any meaning.

Not only have the actual conflagrations not ceased, but the international chaos caused by the COVID-19 has been exploited by warlords and totalitarian regimes to take advantage of global paralysis, in many cases undoing progress in development, and aggravating other situations that were already intolerable. One of the many dimensions of the Libyan conflict is the existence on its territory of the world's largest fossil water reserve, a deposit discovered in the 1950s in the desert region of Al-Kufrah, and which forms part of the Nubian Aquifer System, a virtually inexhaustible water resource.

During Gaddafi's time, a pipeline system was developed, which is strategically vital for the supply of running, irrigation, and industrial water to cities on the Libyan coast. Therefore, the control of this territorial area in south-eastern Libya has a specific geostrategic weight, which is part of the calculations of all contenders and stakeholders in Libya. To get a broader idea of why this is so, it is enough to look at UNESCO's statistics on access to potable water, from which 40% of the world's population is excluded, in other words, 3 billion people, with Africa being a particularly bloody case. Beyond the undeniable incentive of the control of Libyan hydrocarbons, Libyan water capacity will convert those who possess it into a plus of power for those who hold it, and not a small influence on the African continent.

An essential component of entities such as the Muslim Brothers is the 'khayr', its social aspect, based on the creation of assistance networks in which they aspire to build a 'virtuous society'. Few elements have as much impact on improving public welfare as implementing the infrastructure required to provide clean water. For every euro invested in piped water and sanitation, an average of 5 euros is saved from the expenditure that is now detracted from investments in economic and social development.

The risks associated with sectarian-based organisations gaining a monopoly on a resource such as that provided by the Nubian Aquifers are obvious: in the absence of supranational organisations equipped with instruments to guarantee regulated and equitable access to drinking water, human rights such as the right to life, health and food, cease to be substantive and become subsidiary and are left to the discretion of those who control the water.

The provision of running water as a lever to raise the quality of life of hundreds of billions of people in North Africa, in order to meet their legitimate human aspirations, is a Herculean task, which requires the development of safe and sustainable water infrastructure in the long term. Without a consensus based on regional, regional understanding and cooperation, this effort will be reduced to the existence of a kind of water cartel that will allow its members to dictate the policies of the area through the hoarding of water. It is more than doubtful that this is avoidable, given the lack of a legislative framework under which international collaboration and the exchange of knowledge can bear fruit, and the state of shock in which the most developed countries find themselves, which are being forced to resuscitate their economies, inducing the governments of these countries to put the lights out, making good the maxim that charity begins at home and leaving good causes outside for another day.

The intrinsic risk of this withdrawal is to overlook the impact that the multiple simultaneous shocks arising from the pandemic will have on countries that have a much more fragile baseline, and in few places is this more true than in Africa: The consequence of this shift in priorities in the West is that the disconnection of the most disadvantaged countries pushes them to use more of what they have to address the effects of COVID-19, diverting resources away from endemic health problems such as Ebola, dengue fever, HIV, malaria and tuberculosis; all of which are accentuated by poor hygiene resulting from the lack of piped water supply systems. Hence, control of water becomes a determining factor in securing power.

Thus, while the fall in GDP in developed countries leads to an increase in relative poverty, in African countries it is absolute poverty that is increasing, with lethal effects on their population. But this is not something that happens in a vacuum; the communicating vessels between the north and south of the Mediterranean are more fluid than the European countries seem willing to admit, something that raises uncomfortable questions of moral responsibility: the expected contraction of economic production in advanced economies will result in the poorest countries suffering a loss of income from exports, as well as from the fall in remittances that migrant workers send back to their countries of origin, which the World Bank estimates at 20%.

The more the countries of Europe close in on themselves, the more severe will be the spiral of economic and social decline in poor countries, accelerating capital flight and the devaluation of their currencies, with the consequent rise in the cost of repaying their foreign debt, and the inevitable reduction in the resources available to make progress towards Agenda 2020. And the warlords will become stronger as they gain control of the most vital resources.

As we said at the beginning, when we wake up from the bad dream, the problems of before will still be here, and they will place before us ethical dilemmas that can hardly be resolved without finding a middle ground between endless discussions and complacent consensus. Once the unimaginable has already taken place as a pandemic, perhaps the time has come to think the unthinkable by speeding up the establishment of global governance structures with the capacity not only to alleviate the real damage that the cessation of economic activity does to the most disadvantaged, but also to put the spotlight back on and act to prevent totalitarianism from instrumentalising the exploitation of natural resources such as those available in Libya in its favour.","During Gaddafi's time, a pipeline system was developed, which is strategically vital for the supply of running, irrigation, and industrial water to cities on the Libyan coast.
Beyond the undeniable incentive of the control of Libyan hydrocarbons, Libyan water capacity will convert those who possess it into a plus of power for those who hold it, and not a small influence on the African continent.
Few elements have as much impact on improving public welfare as implementing the infrastructure required to provide clean water.
For every euro invested in piped water and sanitation, an average of 5 euros is saved from the expenditure that is now detracted from investments in economic and social development.
Hence, control of water becomes a determining factor in securing power.",,[],"['water', 'resources', 'control', 'social', 'libyan', 'countries', 'problems', 'pandemic', 'order', 'libyas', 'economic', 'liquid', 'gold']"

The concentration of internationally supported military and political forces in the two major provinces of Cyrenaica and Tripoli has left Fezzan, Libya’s third province, largely ignored. Residents say this immense territory, which is roughly the size of France, lacks everything from medical facilities to a proper fire department and faces constant shortages of electricity, gas and fuel. They blame both sides of the conflict for their worsening situation because the fighting prevents supplies from reaching the region.

In the video below, which was filmed on June 28, a man from Tiwiwi says that a lack of firefighters in the region meant that he had to fight the fire that started in his home all alone. Tiwiwi is a rural community located 175 kilometres from Sebha, which is considered the capital of Fezzan.

""We beseech the two governments, we want a fire truck, an ambulance, medicine. We want everything. Look how we have to put out fires. You have forgotten the people in the south. We don’t have working sewer systems, cash, electricity or hospitals.""

In this post, dated June 20, a resident of Ghat (located about 1,336 km southwest of Tripoli) says that it is almost impossible to get gas for cooking. He says, in the south, you might pay up to 300 dinars (equivalent to €180) for one gas cylinder, while, in the north, it could cost as little as 10 dinars (equivalent to €6.35).

“You, in the north and the east, you don’t know what is going on for us in the south. We buy a canister of gas for 300 dinars, and you are horrified when the price for a canister reaches 10 dinars. We pay three dinars for a litre of petrol and, where you are, it only costs 0.15 dinars,” complains this resident in a video that has garnered nearly 40,000 views.

""There’s been a shortage of gas canisters for the past eight months and there is still no solution""

Abderrahman Sidi is a 25-year-old blogger who lives in Oubari. He says that the central government has not worked to find solutions.

It started to get really difficult to buy a canister of gas back in December and there is still no solution. The normal distribution channels have dried up. Meanwhile, the black market is flourishing and we end up having to pay 300 dinars (€180) for a cylinder, when, usually, it’s no more than three dinars.

Residents wait for gas cylinders to arrive at an official sale point in Oubari.

We can’t rely on electric stoves, either, because sometimes we don’t have electricity for a few days. We end up cooking over wood fires. We also have to buy water tanks because the infrastructure for distributing potable water breaks down all the time and also requires electricity to work. You’d think we were living in the Middle Ages.

To deal with the power cuts, we got a hold of generators, but it is hard to find fuel because most of the time, the petrol stations don’t have anything. Smugglers sell a litre of petrol for three dinars, which is 20 times more expensive than its real price, even though the largest oil field in the country is literally nextdoor [Editor’s note: the Echarara oil field is located 75 kilometres to the east of Oubari] .

We’re also suffering from a cash shortage. Long lines form at the banks each time we hear that they’ve received cash. Sometimes fights break out. All this just to withdraw the small sum of 600 dinars (equivalent to 380 euros).’’

""This long line in front of a petrol station in the south of Libya should be recorded as the longest line in history!” says our Observer Bachir Echeikh.

""The absence of economic activity pushes young people to collaborate with jihadist groups and smugglers”

Bachir Echeikh lives in Ghat and is the president of a local citizens group known as the Anger in Fezzan Movement League. He says that limited infrastructure and a lack of security are the biggest sources of frustration for residents.

The biggest problem is the almost total lack of law enforcement or security forces in a territory as vast as Fezzan. To go from one town to another, you have to travel hundreds of miles on roads that are full of cracks and holes. It is 370 kilometres between Ghat and Oubari, for example. There are no police checkpoints on the road and you may come across criminal gangs that will steal your car or money. They will attack you and you’ll find yourself in the middle of the desert with nothing.

Volunteers attempt to repair cracks in the road between Oubari and Ghat. (Photo sent to us by our Observer Bachir Echeik.)

The economic situation here is catastrophic as well, which is why the black market and all kinds of smuggling thrive in our border region. Young people don’t have any choice but to join these criminal gangs, which sometimes have links to jihadist groups. They join these groups out of necessity, not because they believe in the ideology.

""The nearest emergency doctor is hundreds of kilometres away”

The breakdown of the power grid in our region has affected the already limited medical services. If someone experiences kidney failure and needs dialysis, it turns into a nightmare. Between 2012 and 2017, there wasn’t a single doctor in the Ghat Hospital, except for a few medical caravans that came to help the population for a month at a time.

‘Look at the Ghat Hospital, deserted at the start of the day. There’s no one here, no nurses or doctors, no staff. People in Ghat need to rise up!” cries the person in this video that our Observer Bachr Echeikh shared on his page.

The only two hospitals worthy of their names are in Sebha and Traghen (located 140 kilometres to the south of Sebha) and even those institutions lack medical personnel. In the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic, there is only one emergency doctor in the entire Fezzan region. He works in Sebha, hundreds of kilometres from Ghat.

Since the start of the conflict between the government and foces led by Marshal Khalifa Haftar in April 2019, both warring parties in Libya have tried to cozy up to the tribes in Fezzan to earn their support and gain access to strategic petrol sites in the south of the country. But the loyalty of the tribal forces in Fezzan has gone back and forth between the two camps depending on the military situation. In June 2020, for example, several tribes announced they were pulling out of the armed forces loyal to Marshal Haftar.

492,https://thearabweekly.com/libya-chaos-leaves-city-residents-struggling-water,Libya chaos leaves city residents struggling for water,"ZINTAN - Hundreds of blue pipes lay abandoned in Zintan, Libya, leaving residents struggling to get enough water after the 2011 revolution halted their spot on the world’s largest irrigation project.

“We have nothing in Zintan,” said Al-Sid Chanta, a trucker who collects water supplied from a reservoir to deliver to residents’ homes.

Without the pipes in place to channel water directly to the city, he makes the trip eight times a day to meet people’s basic needs.

“The (public) services are very poor,” said Chanta, who estimated each family needs approximately 40,000 litres of water a month.

Zintan was to be included in Libya’s Great Man-Made River Project, a vast scheme to tap water from underground aquifers deep in the Sahara Desert, purify it and transport it north.

The city’s portion of the project was abandoned after the 2011 ousting of dictator Muammar Qaddafi, leaving locals to rely on the old delivery system for water.

The reservoir feeds wells at the foot of the Nafusa Mountains, where water is collected by truckers who take a steep road to supply less than 50% of Zintan’s 60,000 residents.

Abdallah al-Rammah, director of city hall’s water department, said there is a “large deficit” in water and the distribution network dates to the 1970s. Similar systems are used by other cities around the mountains, such as Rojbane, Nalut and Yafran.

Zintan also lacks a public sewage system, meaning used household water feeds into septic tanks that have polluted the groundwater, which is pumped and used by residents. That has resulted in regular hepatitis C diagnoses, especially among children, a doctor in Zintan said on condition of anonymity.

Zintan Mayor Mustafa al-Barouni said the city has suffered “injustice” and decades of marginalisation. “We find that some cities have basic services, telecommunications, roads, ports and job opportunities and others (such as Zintan) have nothing,” he said.

The mayor hit out at “corruption and the waste of resources” by transitional authorities, claiming the city receives a pittance from the state budget despite a drive for decentralisation.

“We have often resorted to debt,” he said, working with local investors to fund projects.

City authorities cannot meet the water needs of all residents, meaning some pay for privately run trucks, which are expensive.

Political power remains divided in Libya, with a UN-backed Government of National Accord established in Tripoli in 2015.

Such deadlock has hit the finances of the oil-rich country, evident in Zintan by shuttered banks and the long queues at petrol stations. There is little sign of development in the city, apart from a few private construction sites, while African migrants carrying hammers or shovels wait desperately for work.

“We lack everything,” said Mohamad al-Garaj, in his 60s, who complained of price rises.

However, for him, the water shortage remains the greatest problem. “We ask for help from the government and international organisations,” Garaj said.

Development projects were put on hold after the revolution and international efforts to break the political impasse have failed. Attention now turns to a UN conference in mid-April, which Barouni said he hopes can bring changes to his resource-strapped city.

“The tension is such that everyone at this point is convinced of the necessity of finding a solution,” he said.

493,https://www.dandc.eu/en/article/libya-has-worlds-largest-irrigation-project,Libya has the world’s largest irrigation project,"Contrary to common belief, the most important riches of Libya are not the oil wells, but water. The world’s biggest reservoirs of fossil freshwater lie below its desert. Through an extensive pipeline system, these aquifers provide the country with water for consumption and agriculture. The so-called “Great Man-Made River” is the world’s largest irrigation project.

Libya’s Great Man-Made River (GMMR) currently transports almost 2.5 million cubic metres of water daily. It runs through an underground network of pipelines from the Nubian Sandstone Aquifer System in the Great Sahara desert to the coastal urban centres, including Tripoli and Benghazi. The distance is up to 1,600 kilometres. The GMMR currently provides 70 % of all freshwater used in Libya.

Except for the green and fertile strip along the Mediterranean coast, Libya is mainly a huge desert with a few scattered oases. Rain falls only on five percent of its surface. There is not a single river that would carry water the whole year round. Water scarcity has always been a huge problem.

The solution was found by chance when oil companies were drilling in the Libyan desert looking for crude in the 1950s. “They discovered basins containing huge amounts of water,” says geologist Zakaria Al-Keep. “It was fossil freshwater which had been stored underground for thousands of years.”

Libyan researchers were thrilled. They had been assessing various ways of obtaining drinking water. Options included the desalination of seawater or importing water from Europe by pipeline or ships. Now another possibility was to exploit fossil water resources from four underground desert basins: Sarir and Kufra in the south-east and Murzuq and Jabal Hasawanain the south-west. The idea of the GMMR was born.

On 28 August 1984, Muammar Gaddafi, the dictator who was toppled and killed in 2011, laid the foundation stone in Sarir. The plan was to drill 1,350 wells across the four basins.

Many of those wells are now operational. Most are more than 500 metres deep. They are connected to the coast by pre-stressed concrete cylinder pipes. Each pipe is seven meters long; the diameter is four meters. In total, more than 4,000 kilometres of pipeline have been built. They deliver over 6 million cubic meters of water per day. An additional 2,000 kilometres are planned.

The GMMR is the world’s biggest irrigation project ever. In 1999, the UNESCO awarded Libya a prize for notable scientific research regarding the use of water in desert areas.

The infrastructure is owned by the GMMR Project Authority. The primary contractor for the first phases in the Gaddafi era was the Dong Ah Consortium. Currently, the main contractor is Al Nahr. Both are domestic construction companies. Korean and Australian firms have supplied some technical parts.

So far, Libya has managed to build the GMMR without financial support from other countries or loans from banks. Taxes on tobacco and fuel contributed to mobilise money, and of course oil revenues helped. The total costs of the GMMR amount to more than $ 36 billion so far. By 2007, three out of five project phases were implemented, providing all major cities with water. Phase four has made good progress, but further construction was put on hold because of the revolution in 2011 and on-going civil war ever since.



The Nubian Sandstone Aquifer System

Fossil water is stored in deep layers of the earth. Most of it has probably been there since glaciers melted thousands of years ago. The Nubian Sandstone Aquifer System (NSAS) is the biggest fossil freshwater reservoir in the world, estimated at 373,000 billion cubic metres, covering some 2 million square kilometres.

The NSAS lies under the Sahara desert, underneath the territorial lands of Libya, Chad, Egypt and Sudan. In 2013, the governments of these four countries agreed on a framework for joint management of the water resources, which have the potential to meet their growing water demands for a long time.

Careful management is necessary, however. Most likely, the aquifers’ water is not replenished by nature and will eventually be depleted. Accordingly, questions arise as to how long the resources will last. GMMR officials say that there so far is no decisive scientific proof of the origins of the water.

“In cooperation with different international institutions, we are measuring the level of the fossil water annually,” says Mahmud Abu Aisha of the GMMR. “We discovered that the level of the underground water drops by one centimetre in some years, which means nothing.” Surprisingly, however, the level actually rises in some years. His conclusion is that “there might be larger tributaries to our underground basins.”

GMMR officials reckon that Libya’s underground water could last for 650 years. Other experts claim the aquifers will be exhausted in 250 years. The default age of the pipelines, however, is 50 years. They must be renewed twice per century.



Agriculture and environment

Thanks to the massive freshwater flows from the GMMR, agriculture has become feasible also in desert areas. The government invested in seven big agricultural schemes. One is south of Tripoli, the capital. This project in the Jafara plains consists of 3,300 hectares, divided into 665 farms. These farms produce different kinds of citrus fruits, wheat, barley and vegetables. There were plans to plant millions of palm trees farther south, but fighting in recent years disrupted developments.

Environmental impacts should generally be assessed before a major project is started. Libyan law demands that this must be done. But it did not happen in the case of the GMMR, as Khalifa Elawej, an advisor to the General Board of Environment, points out. The political decision to start was taken in view of an “acute shortage of water”. At the time, the cost of fossil water was only a tenth of that of desalinated water. To date, no environmental impact assessment has been done.

According to Elawej, it is impossible to give an accurate account of the environmental effects because relevant data are unavailable. Lots of research would be needed. However, some impacts are obvious, he says. Positive impacts include:

The GMMR has helped to expand the green areas in the north and west of the country, stemming further desertification.

The green areas contribute to tempering the weather.

Traditional water resources in the north have been spared as people can now rely on GMMR water instead.

Agricultural production has increased.

There are downsides too, according to Elawej:

The desert environment of the areas where the fossil water is taken from may be changing.

The pipeline network itself may affect the environment.

Some of the water is stored in open pools, and evaporation leads to salinisation. Salinity of the GMMR water is high according to international standards, though it is not as bad as in the north’s traditional wells, which are affected by an influx of seawater.

Since most – and perhaps all – of the fossil water is not renewable, limited resources are being used.



Destruction and sabotage

In the course of the civil war, the GMMR has suffered severe damage. During the revolution in 2011, NATO airplanes bombed water ducts in Brega. They also targeted a pipe factory, possibly in order to cut off Gaddafi’s forces from their water supply. More recently, sabotage actions took place in the south. In March 2017, the GMMR administration issued a warning that repeated assaults on wells at Jabal Hasawna might completely stop the water flow to Tripoli and other north-western cities.

Libyans are proud of the GMMR. But they also know that they depend on it. Urban people used to have only very limited access to drinking water. “I remember the years when my father used to drive for two hours to visit friends at the next oasis and bring back some gallons of fresh drinking water,” recalls Maia Ben Shaban, who lives in Tripoli. She has fond memories of the special day when the GMMR was linked to the city in 1996, substantially improving residents’ standard of life.

494,https://theecologist.org/2015/may/14/war-crime-nato-deliberately-destroyed-libyas-water-infrastructure,War crime: NATO deliberately destroyed Libya's water infrastructure,"Numerous reports comment on the water crisis that is escalating across Libya as consumption outpaces production. Some have noted the environmental context in regional water scarcity due to climate change.

But what they ignore is the fact that the complex national irrigation system that had been carefully built and maintained over decades to overcome this problem was targeted and disrupted by NATO.

During the 2011 military invasion, press reports surfaced, mostly citing pro-rebel sources, claiming that pro-Gaddafi loyalists had shut down the water supply system as a mechanism to win the war and punish civilians.

This is a lie.

But truth, after all, is the first casualty of war - especially for mainstream media journos who can't be bothered to fact-check the claims of people they interview in war zones, while under pressure from editors to produce copy that doesn't rock too many boats.

Critical water installations bombed - then blamed on Gaddafi

It was in fact NATO which debilitated Libya's water supply by targeting critical state-owned water installations, including a water-pipe factory in Brega.

The factory, one of just two in the country (the other one being in Gaddafi's home-town of Sirte), manufactured pre-stressed concrete cylinder pipes for the Great Manmade River (GMR) project, an ingenious irrigation system transporting water from aquifers beneath Libya's southern desert to about 70% of the population.

On 18th July, a rebel commander boasted that some of Gaddafi's troops had holed up in industrial facilities in Brega, but that rebels had blocked their access to water: ""Their food and water supplies are cut and they now will not be able to sleep.""

In other words, the rebels, not Gaddafi loyalists, had sabotaged the GMR water pipeline into Brega. On 22nd July, NATO followed up by bombing the Brega water-pipes factory on the pretext that it was a Gaddafi ""military storage"" facility concealing rocket launchers.

""Major parts of the plant have been damaged"", said Abdel-Hakim el-Shwehdy, head of the company running the project. ""There could be major setback for the future projects.""

Legitimate military target left untouched in the attack

When asked to provide concrete evidence of Gaddafi loyalists firing from inside the water-pipe factory, NATO officials failed to answer. Instead, NATO satellite images shown to journalists confirm that a BM-21 rocket launcher identified near the facility days earlier, remained perfectly intact the day after the NATO attack.

Earlier, NATO forces had already bombed water facilities in Sirte, killing several ""employees of the state water utility who were working during the attack.""

By August, UNICEF reported that the conflict had ""put the Great Manmade River Authority, the primary distributor of potable water in Libya, at risk of failing to meet the country's water needs.""

The same month, Agence France Presse reported that the GMR ""could be crippled by the lack of spare parts and chemicals"" - reinforced by NATO's destruction of water installations critical to the GMR in Sirte and Brega.

The GMR is now ""struggling to keep reservoirs at a level that can provide a sustainable supply"", UN officials said. ""If the project were to fail, agencies fear a massive humanitarian emergency.""

Christian Balslev-Olesen, UNICEF Libya's head of office, warned that the city faced ""an absolute worst-case scenario"" that ""could turn into an unprecedented health epidemic"" without resumption of water supplies.

Stratfor email: 'So much shit doesn't add up here'

While pro-rebel sources attempted to blame Gaddafi loyalists for the disruption of Libya's water supply, leaked emails from the US intelligence contractor Stratfor, which publicly endorsed these sources, show that the firm privately doubted its own claims.

""So much shit doesn't add up here"", wrote Bayless Parsley, Stratfor's Middle East analyst, in an email to executives. ""I am pretty much not confident in ANY of the sources ... If anything, just need to be very clear how contradictory all the information is on this project ... a lot of the conclusions drawn from it are not really air tight.""

But the private US intelligence firm, which has played a key role in liaising with senior Pentagon officials in facilitating military intelligence operations, was keenly aware of what the shutdown of the GMR would mean for Libya's population:

""Since the first phase of the 'river's' construction in 1991, Libya's population has doubled. Remove that river and, well, there would likely be a very rapid natural correction back to normal carrying capacities.""

""How often do Libyans bathe? You'd have drinking water for a month if you skipped a shower"", joked Kevin Stech, a Stratfor research director. ""Seriously. Cut the baths and the showers and your well water should suffice for drinking and less-than-optional hygiene.""

The truth - government officials were trying to keep water flowing

Meanwhile, UNICEF confirmed that Libyan government officials were not sabotaging water facilities, but in fact working closely with a UN technical team to ""facilitate an assessment of water wells, review urgent response options and identify alternatives for water sources.""

Nevertheless, by September, UNICEF reported that the disruption to the GMR had left 4 million Libyans without potable water.

The GMR remains disrupted to this day, and Libya's national water crisis continues to escalate.

The deliberate destruction of a nation's water infrastructure, with the knowledge that doing so would result in massive deaths of the population as a direct consequence, is not simply a war crime, but potentially a genocidal strategy.

It raises serious questions about the conventional mythology of a clean, humanitarian war in Libya - questions that mainstream journalists appear to be uninterested in, or unable to ask.

It is bordered in the north by the Mediterranean Sea, in the east by Egypt and Sudan, in the south by Chad and Niger, and in the west by Algeria and Tunisia. Four physiographic regions can be distinguished:

The Coastal Plains that run along the Libyan coast and vary in width; The Northern Mountains that run close to the coastal plains and include the Jabal Nafusah in the west and the Jabal al Akhdar in the east; The Internal Depressions that cover the center of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya and include several oases; The Southern and Western Mountains.

Annual rainfall is extremely low, with about 93 percent of the land surface receiving less than 100 millimeters per year (mm/year). The highest rainfall occurs in the northern Tripoli region (Jabal Nafusah and Jifarah Plain) and in the northern Benghazi region (Jabal al Akhdar), these two areas being the only ones where the average annual rainfall exceeds the minimum value (250-300 mm) considered necessary to sustain rainfed agriculture. Rainfall occurs during the winter months, but great variability is observed from place to place and from year to year. Average annual rainfall for the country as a whole is 26 mm.

The World Bank reports that at least 80 countries have water shortages and 2 billion people lack access to clean water. More disturbingly, the World Health Organization has reported that 1 billion people lack enough water to simply meet their basic needs, unfortunately in many countries water is scarce or contaminated.

Pure Aqua provides wide range of filtration and economical solutions based on the Libya's water resources.





Libya's main water resources are:

Surface water is water from river, lake or fresh water wetland, which can be treated using different methods, such as Ultrafiltration Systems, Brackish Water RO.

Desalination can be used for water from ocean, or sea source, which can be treated using Seawater Reverse Osmosis Systems ; Desalination Systems.

Desalination Systems. Ground Water or brackish water is from water located in the pore space of soil and rock “Borehole well”, which can be treated using Reverse Osmosis Systems , Chemical Dosing, UV Water Sterilizer .

Chemical Dosing, Government water supply, which could have high level of hardness or high level of chlorine, can be treated with Water Softener System , Media Water Filters.

Water challenges in Libya

Just like many other African countries, Libya suffers from extreme water scarcity. This issue has increasingly grown as the Libyan population continues to rapidly expand, including low rainfall and the greater demand for water in regards to industrial and agricultural use. Government policies aimed at increasing food production has resulted in further exploitation of brackish water sources for irrigation and even more diminished of other water sources due to the fact that most of the country's ground water sources are not renewable.

497,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/libyans-dig-water-well-test-for-tripoli-residents-a8024646.html,Libya: Residents in Tripoli drill through pavements in desperate bid to find water,"Across Libya's capital residents have started drilling through pavements to access wells in a desperate search for water after the taps ran dry in a new low for living conditions.

After years of neglect, workers turned off the water to do urgent maintenance earlier this month, cutting supplies to many Tripoli households. Then an armed group sabotaged the system, prolonging the misery.

The water crisis is a powerful symbol of state failure in a country that was once one of the wealthiest in the Middle East but has been gripped by turmoil since a 2011 uprising unseated Muammar Gaddafi.

For Libyans the chaos has meant power cuts and crippling cash shortages. These are often made worse by battles between armed groups vying for control of the fractured oil-rich state and its poorly-maintained infrastructure.

“We haven't had water for ten days. The state does nothing,” said Nasser Said, a landlord in Tripoli's upmarket Ben Ashour district.

Already equipped with a generator to keep the power running during outages that sometimes last more than a day, he hired drillers to dig some 31 meters to extract groundwater for the six apartments in the residential block he owns.

“No water, no electricity. You become a state in a state,” he said, standing next to his building on a leafy side street. “We last had to do this maybe 20 years ago.”

Like many Libyans, Said is sceptical about the chances of U.N.-led peace talks unifying rival factions that have been fighting for control.

The talks were adjourned last week with little sign of progress in creating a government that could stabilise Libya and stand up to armed groups that have repeatedly seized oil facilities and other state assets to make demands.

The U.N.-supported Government of National Accord (GNA) has struggled to impose its authority since its leaders arrived in Tripoli in March last year.

Early last week an armed faction in the south said it had turned off water supplies from Gaddafi's Great Man Made River, a pipeline system that pumps water from underneath Libya's vast southern desert to coastal areas such as Tripoli.

The group is seeking the release of a leader imprisoned by a rival faction in the capital, said Tawfiq Shwehaidi, a manager at the Great Man Made River based in the eastern city of Benghazi.

“We had started maintenance work on the 16th (of October) and cut supplies to Tripoli,” he said.

“Afterwards an armed group... set one power plant on fire which closed three other plants and shut down 24 wells.”

That has deprived residents of water while boosting the business of drillers who for 4,000-6,000 Libyan dinars ($2,940-$4,410 at the official exchange rate) access groundwater unused in some neighbourhoods since the Great Man Made River started pumping water to Tripoli in 1996.

“We drill about three wells in two weeks — it takes about three to four days to drill a well,” said Abdulsalam Forganea, a 23-year-old worker helping to operate an ageing drilling rig.

Parts of Tripoli offer a semblance of normality and power cuts have eased since the summer.

The city has seen fewer big clashes since a handful of armed groups aligned with the GNA earlier this year.

But security is still fragile. A former prime minister was abducted in August for nine days by one of the two most powerful armed groups, while the other engaged in a battle this month that shut down the airport.

A Reuters reporter recently saw a traffic clogged commercial street suddenly empty as a man was fatally shot by militiamen. Kidnapping for ransom is rife.

A conflict that escalated in 2014 has put extra pressure on a Tripoli population that swelled to an estimated three million with the arrival of displaced families from other Libyan cities.

Public health services are failing, inflation has spiralled, and the start of the school year has been delayed by several weeks because teachers are striking over salaries.

Shutdowns crippled oil revenues so little has been spent on repairs and maintenance, and the water network and other infrastructure have been corroded.

Most government spending goes on public salaries, including for former rebel groups that forced their way onto the state payroll after Gaddafi's overthrow.

“No budget has been transferred... since 2011 except the emergency budget, which is the result of the financial difficulties experienced by the Libyan state,” said Naji Assaed, head of the Libyan Water Authority.

Production at desalination plants has fallen sharply, with output at a plant in the western town of Zuwara dropping from 80,000 cubic litres to 16,000 cl annually.

Assaed said officials were working hard to resolve the crisis, but it was not clear when supplies would be restored. As he spoke a tanker arrived up to deliver water for his tattered ministry building.

“In the absence of adequate spare parts, lack of budgets, lack of stability in the security situation, security chaos, people do not comply with the law and all this has affected the performance of the system,” he said.","Across Libya's capital residents have started drilling through pavements to access wells in a desperate search for water after the taps ran dry in a new low for living conditions.

Despite what you hear about Muammar Gaddafi in the media, there is no doubt that he was the pioneer of one of the biggest civilian development projects in the world. Libya’s ex-president didn’t waste his forty-two-year rule on all fun and games like it has been portrayed, and the Great Man-Made River is a testimony to this fact. Gaddafi wanted to provide fresh water for his people. Thus he worked towards turning the desert green and making Libya self-sufficient regarding food and water supply.



Libya is located in the northeastern Africa, and like other countries around it, it’s one of the sunniest and driest desert on the planet. Fresh water sources are scarce, and there are areas where many years might pass without seeing any rainfall at all. Before the project, less than 5% of the country had enough water for settled agriculture, and other than the much expensive desalination plants on the coast, there were no real means for any water supply.

But the game changed when in 1953, vast quantities of ancient water aquifers were discovered that dated back to the Ice Age. This was supposed to be an oil exploration mission, but instead, the team discovered four huge water basins with capacities, each ranging between 4,800 and 20,000 cubic km in capacity. Further studies demonstrated that most of this water was collected between 38,000 and 14,000 years ago, a time when the Saharan region enjoyed a temperate climate.

Soon after a massive engineering project was commissioned by Gaddafi, consisting a network of underground pipes aimed at tapping this fresh water from ancient underground aquifers and bringing it to the drought-stricken Libyan cities. The project was termed as the “Eighth Wonder of the World” by Gaddafi, while the western media named it a “vanity project”, “Gaddafi’s Pet Project” and “the pipe dream of a mad dog”.

But the fact is that till date the Great Man-Made River Project has proved to be a fantastic water delivery system, changing lives of millions of Libyans across the country.

Initially, Gaddafi planned to use this water to create large-scale agricultural projects in the desert, but after public’s reluctance towards moving, he changed the plant to bring the water to the people instead.

In August 1984, the foundations of the pipe production plant were laid by Muammar Gaddafi at Brega. And with that, the Great Man-Made River Project was initiated. The project constituted of around 1,300 wells into the desert soil going down to 500 meters deep in order to pump water from the subterranean water reserves. The pipe routes went through the cities of Tripoli, Benghazi, Sirte and elsewhere, providing water to about 6.5 million people through a network of underground pipes which were 2,800 km long. The pipeline first reached Tripoli in 1996, at the completion of the first phase of the project.

The project was in its third phase when the civil war was imposed on the country. Even with the last two phases yet to be completed, the Great Man-Made River is the world’s largest irrigation project. If and when the fifth and final phase of the project is complete, the network will consist of 4,000 km length of pipes enabling 155,000 hectares of land to be cultivated.

The project was well organised that in 1999, UNESCO accepted Libya’s offer to fund the Great Man-Made River. It also won the International Water Prize, an award that is only given to remarkable scientific research work.

At the time of inauguration of the first phase in 1991, Muammar Gaddafi had said:

“After this achievement, American threats against Libya will double. The United States will make excuses, but the real reason is to stop this achievement, to keep the people of Libya oppressed.”

In July 2011, the Great Man-Made River water supply pipeline was bombed by NATO air strike near Brega. A factory was also destroyed that produces the pipes, with NATO claiming that the factory was being used as “a military storage facility” with “rockets being launched from site”.

NATO’s attack on the pipeline disrupted water supply immensely, cutting down the water supply for over 70% of the population who have become incredibly dependent on the piped supply of water. With the bloody and gruesome civil war’s end nowhere in sight, the present and the future of the Great Man-Made River Project is in great jeopardy.

The hydrological regime of all basins is characterized by high inter-annual variability marked by wet and dry sequences, interspersed with years of strong hydraulic flow or severe drought.

The Ouergha basin, for example, is one of the most productive basins in the country, with an average annual inflow of 2.5 BCM. The large regional disparity of rainfall also induces a large variability of surface water flows. The latter varies from a few million cubic metres (MCM) for the most arid basins, such as the Saharan basins, to 1 BCM/yr for the most water-rich basins. For instance, the Sebou basin holds 30% of surface water and groundwater resources. Although it represents only 6% of the total area of Morocco, 18% of the country’s population lives within it.[2] Internal water reallocations are applied to reduce the shortages in each river basin. About 0.3 MCM is transferred from the Oum er-Rbia basin to dry areas in Tensift, essentially to sustain irrigation. Similarly, another 0.16 MCM is transferred from the Sebou and Oum er-Rbia basins to support Bouregreg’s domestic water needs.[3] Map 1 shows the geographical distribution of the hydrological basins. Table 1 shows the nine Moroccan river basins with their area and flow figures.","Surface water resourcesThe hydrological regime of all basins is characterized by high inter-annual variability marked by wet and dry sequences, interspersed with years of strong hydraulic flow or severe drought.

Deteriorating water quality is one of the major problems facing Morocco’s water sector. Indeed, critical levels of pollution have been observed in several sections of watercourses, and several water streams have high concentrations of phosphorus, ammonia, organic matter and high coliform counts. The Sebou basin, which constitutes 30% of water resources, is heavily polluted by untreated industrial and municipal discharge and agricultural run-off. Nitrates and phosphorus are present as are pesticide residues. The two main rivers, Sebou and Oum er-Rbia, experience critical situations several times a year.[1] The main sources of water pollution can be summarized as follows:

Domestic pollution: On average, 600 MCM of domestic wastewater, containing nearly 360,000 tons of organic materials, discharges into the environment untreated. According to forecasts, wastewater discharges from urban areas will reach 900 MCM by 2020 and up to 1,050 MCM in 2030. Organic matter is high in urban wastewater, and the concentration decreases with the population increase due to dilution effects.

Industrial pollution: Industrial wastewater conveys approximately 140,000 tons of oxidizable materials annually, almost 40% of which is released into the environment. Most industrial activities (agro-food, leather, paper mills, textiles and others) are located on the Atlantic coast in Kenitra-Safi and in the cities of Fez, Tangier, Agadir, Marrakech and Meknes.

Agricultural pollution: This pollution results mainly from the use of fertilizers. On average, 720,000 tons of fertilizer and 8,500 tons of pesticides are applied annually to cultivated areas.

Accidental pollution: More than 30 spills have occurred since 1985. The increase in road traffic and transport of dangerous substances (hydrocarbons, chemicals etc.) expose drinking water intakes and dam reservoirs near highways to the risk of pollution.[2]","Surface water qualityDeteriorating water quality is one of the major problems facing Morocco’s water sector.

Morocco is a water-scarce country confronted with dwindling groundwater reserves and a strong dependence on rain-fed agriculture. Only 15 percent of total agricultural land is irrigated, resulting in inefficient water use and management. Many rural communities rely on a single water source to sustain families and livelihoods. The lack of a functioning sanitation network and wastewater treatment system causes already scarce water resources to become contaminated and unsuitable for multipurpose use.

USAID supports water resource management in Morocco by introducing new technologies to help improve agricultural productivity and rural livelihoods. By working with small farmers and private sector firms, such technology reduces operational costs while using less water. To address water supply, sanitation and hygiene, USAID is working with local-level water-supply government institutions – such as River Basin Agencies and Ministry of Agriculture regional offices - to introduce water-efficient technologies and water management tools that promote conservation and increase public awareness and community involvement in water issues.

It is an ambitious programme whose objective is to improve the supply of drinking water to the population and to develop agriculture through the improvement of irrigation in this North African kingdom.

The Moroccan government’s programme is based on several components. Firstly, it involves the development of hydraulic supply through the construction of new dams in the Kingdom. Thus, by 2027, Morocco plans to build 20 reservoirs, most of which will be filled with rainwater.

As part of this project, the authorities decided in October 2019 to recruit 44 engineers, administrators and technicians. The water supply component of the water supply programme will also enable the construction of three seawater desalination plants in the country.

An investment of more than 10 billion euros

The second aspect of the programme is to focus on water recovery. This concerns in particular measures aimed at making savings in water consumption. Such a policy is necessary in this country with a quasi-desert climate where surface water resources are scarce. Measures to reduce water consumption will be implemented mainly in the agricultural sector which depends on irrigation.

In order to avoid depleting water resources, the authorities want to focus on the reuse of waste water for irrigation of plantations and green spaces, including golf courses. Saâd Eddine El Othmani, the head of the Moroccan government, is calling on all golf clubs to irrigate their courses with treated wastewater. At least 40% of these clubs have already subscribed to the government’s policy. Golf courses are in full development in Morocco, especially around Marrakech. The courses attract tourists and businessmen as well as luxury real estate buyers, but they represent a real calamity in terms of water consumption, which the greens absorb inordinately.

A no less negligible part will be devoted to raising general awareness of the Moroccan population on the valorisation of water. Overall, the Priority Programme for Drinking Water Supply and Irrigation 2020-2027 will make it possible to increase the capacity of dams from 18 billion m³ to 27 billion m³. To this should be added non-conventional water resources, i.e. from seawater desalination plants and treatment plants (reuse). The government will then invest 115 billion Moroccan dirhams (10.7 billion euros) in seven years.

The project is under development and the Moroccan authorities, through the National Electricity and Drinking Water Board (Onee), have recently awarded the contract to the British company Biwater, which specialises in providing sustainable wastewater treatment solutions. The future infrastructure will be located in the south of this North African kingdom, more precisely in the coastal city of Tarfaya.

Through this initiative, the government of Morocco wants to clean up Tarfaya and thus protect the environment from the harmful effects of wastewater. One of the most serious threats to the environment is the contamination of coastal waters, which can cause biological perturbations, resulting in reproductive, growth or immune system disorders in aquatic organisms. The other consequence is bacteriological pollution, which can cause the transmission of diseases to populations.

In order to reduce the ecological impact of raw sewage along the Tarfaya coast, Biwater’s team will provide an accelerated construction programme. The amount of funds invested by Onee has not been disclosed.

The role of the Tarfaya wastewater treatment plant

The new facility will provide pre-treatment, biological treatment and advanced tertiary wastewater treatment, including ultraviolet disinfection and sludge dewatering. The drying beds will also be designed to reduce sewage sludge to dry solids content, which will be safely transferred off-site for disposal.

“After the successful commissioning of similar projects in Tamuda Bay, Khenifra, Aourir and Bukhalef, we are proud to continue our longstanding work to improve sanitation conditions in the country. We will soon deliver another turnkey solution that will serve the residents of Tarfaya and support the clean up of its coastline,” said Yassine Laib, Biwater’s country manager for Morocco.

Following commissioning of the Tarfaya wastewater treatment plant, Biwater will provide 12 months of operational and maintenance support to the local workforce.

Alongside this project, Biwater is also working with Onee under a separate contract. The agreement covers the construction of the main wastewater treatment plant in Laâyoune, the capital of Western Sahara, a territory in North Africa under Moroccan rule. Work is nearing completion. The plant will eventually include a solar-powered sludge-drying greenhouse. The system will enable the effluent sludge produced as a by-product of the wastewater treatment plant to be dried sustainably.

It is the result of two calls for tenders issued at the beginning of May 2020 by the monitoring centre for the protection of the environment and historical monuments in Tangier (Opemh).

The first consultation concerns the carrying out of a study on the situation of wastewater treatment in the city of Tangier. The study will focus on the legal framework and strategy for wastewater treatment, the stocktaking and skills of local actors in charge of wastewater treatment, the reality of water and coastal pollution, and figures on the life of the community and citizens. It will also assess the impacts of untreated or poorly treated wastewater discharges on humans, the environment and the economy.

The second call for tenders concerns the production of an awareness-raising video on the negative effects of untreated or non-reused wastewater. The video will have a maximum length of 5 minutes. It will be presented in two versions (in Arabic Darija and French), and will serve as a message for the advocacy campaign that Opemh will conduct with civil society and public and private actors.

The Green Water Project

The two calls for tenders launched by the Opemh represent important phases in the implementation of the “Green Water” project. Thus, the results of the study on the current status of wastewater treatment will be taken into account in the development of the activities that will follow, including the preparation of a document on “advocacy on the rationalization of water use and wastewater reuse”.

The “Green Water” project is initiated by Opemh, a Moroccan non-profit organisation and financed by the European Union through the Moucharaka Mouwatina programme, a support programme for civil society in Morocco. It aims to reduce the negative effects of wastewater in the city of Tangier, to preserve water as a vital resource, to strengthen the capacities of local actors, to direct them towards reducing the negative effects of wastewater, and also to raise awareness among the population on the importance of water conservation.

It should be recalled that pollution due to wastewater is rampant off the coast of Tangier. One of the most memorable cases took place on September 30, 2017. A power cut at the Amendis wastewater treatment plant (the water and electricity distribution company), located near the port of Tangier, resulted in large quantities of wastewater being discharged into the sea. The result: considerable environmental damage and foul odours over a very wide area.

The current agricultural season is marked by a significant drop in rainfall. “We have dropped to 141 millimetres compared to an average of 254 millimetres over the last 30 years, a deficit of 44 percent compared to a normal year,” said Aziz Akhannouch, Morocco’s Minister of Agriculture. “There has also been a significant reduction in the country’s dam reservoirs,” he said.

This situation seriously undermines the country’s economic security. The agricultural sector is the largest contributor to Morocco’s gross domestic product (14%), ahead of tourism and industry. “In 2019 we had recorded a drop in agricultural value added of 3 to 4%. This year it will probably be around 5%,” says Ahmed Lahlimi, the head of the High Commission for Planning (HCP), responsible for official statistics in Morocco.

It is in this context that Morocco has decided to strengthen its cooperation with Hungary for better management of its water resources. The Moroccan Minister of Equipment, Transport, Logistics and Water, Abdelkader Amara, and Sandor Pinter, the Hungarian Minister of the Interior, responsible for the water sector, thus met on March 7, 2020 in Budapest, the capital of Hungary. The two men agreed on a model partnership. This will enable Moroccan students and researchers to be trained in water resource management.

Continuing education and training…

In the framework of this new partnership, Hungary is committed to providing continuing education to Moroccan students and researchers on the management of water resources and natural phenomena such as floods and drought. They will also receive training in water treatment. “Hungary has developed innovative and efficient technologies, particularly in the agricultural and climatic fields. The country is willing to share its experience with Morocco,” says Sandor Pinter. Morocco, for its part, has undertaken to share its experience with Hungary in the water resource management industry and to expand this cooperation. It plans to include sub-Saharan Africa through concrete projects in accordance with targeted programmes.

Outside this partnership, the two countries signed the executive programme of the Memorandum of Understanding between Morocco and Hungary in Budapest in 2016, in order to ensure the follow-up of joint projects and programmes for the period 2021 to 2023. These projects focus on water resources management and the strengthening of programmes to combat climate change in rural areas.

In 2019, the country experienced one of the worst droughts in recent years due to lack of rainfall. In a report published in August of the same year by the World Resources Institute (WRI), Morocco ranks 22nd among the countries most affected by water stress. Despite the many actions taken, the phenomenon continues to be rampant in the country. Concerned, the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA) sounded the alarm in a report published in early March 2020. According to the document, “by 2025, water stress is expected to worsen. Morocco could thus experience a state of water scarcity with forecasts of less than 1000 m³ of available fresh water per year per inhabitant. A situation that would undermine the country’s economy”. To counter this threat, the Moroccan government has recently released more than 118 billion Moroccan dirhams (12 billion dollars) to secure the supply of water in the kingdom and rationalise its use, particularly in agriculture.

The response programme

Currently the water stress in the Cherifian Kingdom is between 1,000 and 1,700 m³ of available fresh water per year and per capita. To improve these statistics, the response programme includes the construction of dams. In this way, water storage could be improved, even if this raises questions of use and does not resolve the issue of the resource. However, the programme also provides for the preservation of the resource and the increase of water supply in rural areas.

Emergency measures also include the irrigation of 510,000 hectares of plantations. The initiative is expected to benefit 160,000 farmers. Traditional irrigation systems will be renovated and improved using drip irrigation technology, for example, which combines efficiency of yield with intelligent conservation of the resource. “About 9.8 billion Moroccan dirhams ($990 million) allocated by the State will be invested to convert and equip another 350,000 hectares of agricultural land with this new irrigation system,” said Aziz Akhannouch, Morocco’s Minister of Agriculture. Morocco’s new emergency drought programme will run from 2020 to 2027.

They were obtained through a loan from the Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau (KfW), the German development agency. The loan agreements were recently signed between Abderrahim El Hafidi, General Manager of Onee, Jorg Dux, Head of Water Division, North Africa of KfW, and Markus Faschina, Director of KfW’s office in Morocco.

The funds allocated to Onee by KfW will be used to implement Phase I of Component II of the Drinking Water Supply Programme for Small and Medium-sized Centres. In concrete terms, €28.5 million has been allocated to strengthen the supply of drinking water in several localities in this North African country. On the technical level, these are the reinforcement of pumping stations, treatment plants, reservoirs and the distribution network. Onee estimates that this project will benefit 1.5 million people in Morocco.

A seawater desalination and wastewater treatment project

The KfW loan will also support the Settat Drinking Water Supply Programme. With a budget of €22 million, the aim is to increase production at the Daourat treatment plant in western Morocco. It deals with water pumped into the reservoir of the Daourat Multipurpose Dam built on the Oum Errabiaa River. It is also used to produce electricity and irrigate plantations in Settat province.

The improved performance of the Daourat drinking water plant will provide water to 352,000 people in Settat province. Part of the German bank’s funding will also be used to implement the second phase of the programme entitled Sanitation of Small Centres III. Its objective is the rehabilitation of sanitation systems in small and medium-sized towns in the Cherifian kingdom.

The desalination project in Sidi Ifni will also receive financial support from KfW. This involves an envelope of 70,000 euros for the feasibility study for the construction of the desalination plant outfall. As a reminder, the Sidi Ifni water desalination project includes the construction of six coastal boreholes for seawater pumping. All the boreholes will provide 225 litres of water per second. This water will be conveyed to the plant through a pipe with a diameter of between 250 and 500 mm over a distance of 4.4 km. The water will then be treated by reverse osmosis in the desalination plant with a capacity of 100 litres per second.

This involves 51 million euros granted by the French Development Agency (AFD). € 50 million of this amount represents a loan and €1 million a grant for studies and institutional capacity building.

The funds will be used to secure access to safe drinking water in the northern provinces of Morocco, Al Hoceima, Driouch, Nador and Taounate. “Water supply duration will be reduced and the quality of the resource improved. It is also about helping to preserve water resources by reducing leaks, improving network efficiency and mobilising sustainable resources,” says Mihoub Mezouaghi, AFD’s Director in Morocco. The improvement of Onee’s services will take place in both urban and rural areas.

To succeed in this task, the public utility would have to turn to “sustainable surface resources”, since the water table is already drying up in this part of the Cherifian kingdom. It will thus be able to count on the water reservoirs of Bouhouda and Asfalou. The latter is built on the Oued Asfalou, a tributary of the Ouargha River. It is a multipurpose dam since it provides 30 million kWh of electricity by retaining 320 million m3 of water over at least 9 km2. It is also used to supply drinking water. The reservoir was built as part of the Master Plan for the development of water resources in the Sebou-Bouregreg-Oum Er Rbia basins.

The Bouhouda dam is also multi-purpose, except that in addition to supplying water to the population, it is also used to irrigate at least 3,000 hectares of plantations. The water reservoir is built on the Sra River, in the Bouhouda area. The dam holds 55 million m3 of water. However, there is still a risk: the overexploitation of these two dams, which could destroy the rivers, thus affecting the ecosystem of this region with its already arid climate.

Today, 83 percent of Moroccans have access to improved drinking water, and 72 percent have access to improved sanitation. However, in a steadily growing population, the percentage of Moroccans lacking such access are faced with many challenges. Here are eight facts about water quality in Morocco.

8 Facts About Water Quality in Morocco

In just half a century, Morocco’s population has more than tripled from 10 million to 32 million. Mass migrations have brought more than half the population to cities, giving rise to “tin cities,” or slums. These communities are located on the outskirts of urban areas, where access to clean water, electricity and sanitation services does not exist. The one-third of Moroccans without access to proper sanitation services are at high risk of waterborne diseases such as gastrointestinal infections, malaria and typhoid. Agriculture is responsible for 19 percent of Morocco’s GDP, but only 15 percent of agricultural land has access to irrigation. Due to a lack of sanitation services and inadequate wastewater treatment, the already scarce water resources for irrigation are often contaminated. Due to climate change, rainfall in Morocco is predicted to decline by as much as 50 percent by the year 2050, increasing the risk of droughts. Between 2004 and 2011, Morocco’s own Cities Without Slums urban development campaign created 100,000 new housing units in different parts of the country, providing 1.5 million people with access to water, power and sanitation. In 2016, USAID provided 336 Moroccan families with information on the best sanitation and hygiene practices. It also rehabilitated the retaining walls of a community’s water reservoir to prevent contamination. The same year, Moroccan farmers received irrigation advice for their crops from USAID through an SMS service, helping the country’s agrarian society achieve the greatest potential from limited resources. Also in 2016, the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization teamed up with USAID to create a regional drought monitoring system that serves to maximize early warnings for droughts in North Africa and the Middle East.

While steps are being made toward a promising future, efforts of local and foreign aid to improve water quality in Morocco and strengthen resources must gain momentum in order to counter the effects of a growing population and a warming world.

The programme, announced by King Mohammed VI on Tuesday, 7 January, will include the construction of dams, irrigation, improving the delivery of drinking water to rural areas, the treatment and reuse of wastewater, “awareness-raising” to reduce demand and the preservation of water resources.

The expenditure will form part of the draft 2020-2050 National Water Plan, which was discussed by the Moroccan government in December. This envisages the spending of $40bn on “dams, the connection of water basins, the desalination of seawater, the integration of all rural centres into structured drinking water supply systems”.

The World Resources Institute (WRS) ranks Morocco 22nd among countries facing water stress, owing to a combination of scarcity, climate-change, socio-economic development, urbanisation, and population growth.

Among the challenges it faces are dwindling reserves of groundwater and a dependence on rainfall, as only 15% of agricultural production benefits from irrigation. American aid agency USAID notes that many rural communities rely on a single water source, and that the “lack of a functioning sanitation network and wastewater treatment system causes scarce water resources to become contaminated and unsuitable for multipurpose use”.

The project called “Eaux Vertes” (Green Waters) is financed by the European Union via the Musharaka Mouwatina (meaning “Citizen Participation” in Arabic) programme. As well as sensitizing the city’s residents to the importance of water conservation, ‘Green Waters’ will also contribute to preserve this vital resource by creating a multi-stakeholder committee to monitor and control water pollution.

For the first and central part of the project, the OPEMH has launched a call for tenders to carry out a study regarding the condition of wastewater treatment facilities in the city of Tangier. According to Morocco World News, researchers of an external scientific body should conduct the study within 30 days of signing the contract, under the guidelines and supervision of the OPEMH.

The report will focus on the legal framework and strategy for wastewater treatment, the inventory and skills of local actors in charge of wastewater treatment, the reality of water and coastal pollution, and its effect on the population. It will also assess the impacts of untreated or inadequately treated wastewater discharges on the environment, the economy and the residents.

Finally, it will establish proposals to develop wastewater treatment capacities and rationalize the use of drinking water. During that time, the OPEMH will launch an awareness-raising campaign that will be directed at the media and public and private institutions involved in the water sector.

“In the world where the demand for freshwater increases yet where freshwater resources shrink constantly due to overexploitation, pollution, and climate changes, it is simply inconceivable to neglect the opportunities provided by wastewater treatment,” reads OPEMH’s introduction to the study proposal.

Tangier has two sewage treatment plants for the city’s wastewater. However, the two facilities only treat 20% of the wastewater. The Bouknadel plant treats nearly 100,000 cubic metres per day, and the Boukhalef plant treats nearly 5,000 cubic metres per day. This means, over 400,000 cubic metres remain untreated and are dumped directly into the sea.

The importance of reusing wastewater recently gained prominence with the prolonged drought affecting Moroccan harvests. The authorities hope the Green Waters project will be a leading example in the wastewater treatment sector for Moroccan cities, contributing to the well-being of citizens and the environment alike.","The project called “Eaux Vertes” (Green Waters) is financed by the European Union via the Musharaka Mouwatina (meaning “Citizen Participation” in Arabic) programme.

Fez – Last year, hundreds of thousands of people in the Middle East and North Africa, including Morocco, faced the worst water shortages in decades. More than 60% of the population in this region is concentrated in places affected by high or very high surface water stress, which means that water resources are heavily exploited at an unsustainable rate.

I have argued previously that “multiple factors have contributed to the current situation, including climate change, desertification, water pollution, and misuse of natural resources. Inadequate information, education, and communication exacerbate many of these challenges, as it reinforces a lack of awareness of – much less commitment to – environmentally friendly practices. Add to that inadequate disaster-risk reduction and management by governments – many of which are dealing with other conflicts and crises – and the situation has become truly dire.”

According to government statistics, Morocco’s water resources are among the weakest in the world, with the lowest amount of water per capita due to climate change. Water resources are estimated at 22 billion cubic meters per year, equivalent to 700 cubic meters per person per year.

The water issue is complex because it touches on geographic challenges, the problem of governance, climate change, and the demographic problem: Tourism is developing, agriculture and industry are growing, and cities are expanding.

Water shortages in Middle East and North African countries could also help cause destabilization, according to a recent report by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Bank.

Because of repetitive droughts in the last three decades, each summer, a number of Moroccan areas suffer from lack of drinking water. Last August, many people suffered from the lack of drinking water when taps ran dry on Eid al-Adha.

Better governance is part of the solution

Solutions exist, especially in the area of good governance. Water resources and distribution are everyone’s responsibility because everybody uses it on a daily basis.

Water concerns must also be part of our education system. We also need proactive thinking, sensitizing the population, and involving all sectors, especially agriculture.

Morocco has developed experience in water management, but the pace of work must be accelerated. While some policies for better management of water are being implemented, there have been delays in disinfection and desalination projects.

The UN and World Bank report, titled “Water management in fragile systems: building resilience to shocks and protracted crises in the Middle East and North Africa,” notes that effective water resources management can be key to growth and stability.

“Instability combined with poor water management can become a vicious cycle that further exacerbates social tensions,” the UN and World Bank experts stressed.

The report urges countries in the region to move from policies focused on increasing supplies to long-term management of water resources. It also recommends relying on new technologies to support sustainable growth rather than ineffective policies that make people vulnerable to the effects of water shortage, exacerbated by the increasing demand and climate change.

In a press release associated with the report, the UN warns that “climate-related water scarcity is expected to cause economic losses estimated at 6 to 14% of Gross Domestic Product by 2050, the highest in the world.”

Economic losses in the region mean high unemployment. The impact of water problems on traditional livelihoods, such as agriculture, is likewise exacerbated by climate change and bad governance, according to UN experts.

The report also points to the danger of food insecurity, which may lead to forced climate migration, as well as to growing frustrations with governments unable to guarantee basic services.

International cooperation is necessary

Morocco has begun a number of initiatives that attempt to prevent droughts and handle water challenges, including plans to install more than 100,000 solar pumps for irrigation by 2020. But unless water resources are managed with extraordinary care, the consequences could be devastating.

The international community should encourage countries like Morocco to embrace strong cooperation by creating financial instruments that make concessional and preferential funds available.

The global cooperation that has emerged since the Paris climate change agreement is certainly welcome. But while teamwork is critical to success, so is recognition of the distinct responsibilities of governments in the industrialized and developing worlds.

As the Marrakech declaration emphasizes, success in mitigating climate change will require political commitment at the highest level. Moreover, climate action must take into account the special needs and context of developing countries, especially the least-developed economies and those most vulnerable to the effects of climate change.

With this in mind, the declaration demands greater efforts to eradicate poverty, ensure food security, and meet the agriculture challenges posed by climate change. It also calls for greater support for climate projects, including through capacity building and technology transfer from developed to developing countries.

The responsibility goes beyond government

Of course, the responsibility for mitigating climate change does not fall only on government. NGOs, for example, are already having a major impact, implementing educational programs and even staging protests to raise awareness of the environmental challenges we face.

However, in many ways, government is critical to enabling such contributions. While tackling climate change effectively will be virtually impossible without civil society organizations’ participation, their impact has often been undermined by politics. Governments may, for example, favor incumbent energy suppliers over green alternatives in order to preserve existing jobs.

Some governments have already implemented important measures to support the shift toward more environmentally-friendly practices, including financial and market incentives.

Only with more such initiatives, as well as a commitment to follow through on the Marrakech declaration and to support the goals of the Africa Action Summit, can governments put their countries, and the world, on the path toward true sustainable development.

Spread the love

Rabat – In its latest reports on overall water stress, the World Resources Institute (WRS) has ranked Morocco among the countries threatened to face high baseline water stress. Morocco appears 22nd in the overall ranking and 12th in Arab countries.

The WRS attributed water scarcity to climate-change, socio-economic development, urbanization, and population growth.

The report found that 12 out of the 17 most water-stressed countries are in the MENA region – home to one-quarter of the world’s population.

“The region is hot and dry, so water supply is low to begin with, but growing demands have pushed countries further into extreme stress,” the report said.

The 17 countries use more than 80% of the available supply on average every year.

In a report carried by the World Bank, it is found that water-scarcity will inevitably affect economies in the MENA region and is expected to cause a loss in GDP of 6-14% by 2050.

The WRS has stated that there are countless solutions to tackle water shortage but only stated the most 3 effective ways.

The solutions include: Investing in grey and green infrastructure by building pipes and treatment plants, as well as wetlands, and healthy watersheds.

Increase agricultural efficiency by improving irrigation techniques (using precision watering rather than flooding fields) and using seeds that require less water, in addition to reducing food loss and waste, which use one-quarter of all agricultural water.

The Washington DC-based organization suggested advance treating, reusing, and recycling as a third solution to create a “new” water source.

Leaders in treatment and reuse

With 100% of its water treated and 78% of it is reused, Oman – ranked 16th in the list – has emerged as a leader in water treatment and reuse.

Gulf Cooperation Countries (GCC) treat around 84% of wastewater collected, but only 44% are reused.

The world’s largest wastewater treatment plant is found in Washington DC. On a daily average, the Blue Plains plant treats close to 300 million gallons of wastewater and has the ability to treat over 1 billion gallons a day at peak flow, according to the plant’s website.

Earth Overshoot Day

Water shortage is not the only alarming environmental issue to hit headlines. A study carried out by the Global Footprint Network shows that humanity has depleted, in just 7 months, all of its share of natural resources such as water, soil, and clean air for the year. This means that the earth’s population is currently consuming the resources of future generations.

The Earth Overshoot Day fell this year on July 29, which is the earliest date ever, according to a report from the Global Footprint Network. The Overshoot Day marks the date when humanity’s level of consumption exceeds the number of natural resources the earth can regenerate.

Spread the love

Rabat – Morocco’s dams are suffering from chronic water deficit, impacting the country’s supply for drinking water and irrigation. Experts warn the situation could worsen, leading to the depletion of Morocco’s water reserves.

The Regional Council of Souss-Massa addressed the issue during an event on July 6 in Agadir, underlining exceptionally low dam filling rates. At 16.24%, the Souss-Massa region’s filling rate this year is 13.58% less compared to the same period in 2019.

The Abdelmoumen dam in Taroudant currently retains only 5.9% of its capacity, while the Youssef Ben Tachfine dam is filled to a mere 12.9%. Agricultural areas in the region are struggling to meet the water supply demands for irrigation systems.

The Aoulouz dam is down 22.4% compared to the same period in 2019. Its current filling rate of 33.8% strains the Grand Agadir region to secure enough drinking water for local communities.

The Souss-Massa region is not the only region struggling to meet water needs. Recent heatwaves, recurrent drought, and overexploitation of water resources have contributed to the risk of reservoirs drying up and the overall lack of the vital natural resource in Morocco.

In early March, Minister of Agriculture Aziz Akhannouch stressed the dire need for rainfall in order to resuscitate the hard-hit agricultural sector. While the month of March saw enough rain to boost the country’s overall dam fill rates from 46.2% to 49.7%, Morocco is still in critical need of water security solutions.

The Moroccan government has taken initiatives to improve the dams’ retention and filling rates in order to ensure sufficient water supply. The national program for the supply of drinking water and irrigation, devoted to improving water scarcity between 2020 and 2027, has secured MAD 115 billion ($11.9 billion) for the Souss-Massa region.

Morocco’s National Office of Electricity and Drinking Water (ONEE) is launching a local drinking water project aimed at contributing to water infrastructure development throughout the country. The project is aimed at supporting the eastern Guercif region by providing over 143,200 residents with a clean drinking water supply by 2022.

Morocco’s 35% drinking water production deficit and the significant lack of water for agricultural practices are not the only water-related concerns that the country is facing. Water scarcity issues are presenting greater problems than usual as critical efforts are being made to promote health and hygiene amid the COVID-19 pandemic.","Water reserves throughout Morocco are seeing alarmingly low filling rates this year, threatening the country’s drinking water supply and agricultural production.

The increase of water levels in reservoirs throughout Morocco

Between April 28th and March 18th this year, according to data provided by the Moroccan Ministry of Equipment, Transport, Logistics, and Water, the country recorded relatively significant rainfall occurrences, consequently impacting the water situation over a large part of the national territory.

For instance, these rainfalls led to the rise of the overall water levels in dams from 46.2% as of mid-March to about 49.7% late last month. That is a contribution of at least 1 billion and 50 million m³.

Rabat – Director of the Sebou Water Basin Agency Samira El Haouat announced Tuesday, January 28, that Morocco plans to construct four large dams in the Fez-Meknes region by 2027.

El Haouat announced the projects during a meeting on King Mohammed VI’s 2020-2027 National Drinking Water Supply and Irrigation Program.

The current storage capacity of the Sebou Hydraulic basin is around 5.549 billion cubic meters. The addition of four new dams will bring the total to 8 billion cubic meters, El Haouat stated.

The four dams will cost a total of MAD 6.7 billion (around $694 million).

A total of 28 small dams are confirmed for construction in the region, concerning the province of Ifrane (1 dam), the prefecture of Meknes (1 dam), the provinces of Sefrou and Taza (2 dams each), El Hajeb (1 dam), the province of Taounate (2 dams) and the province of Boulemane (19 dams).

The new dams fall under the framework of Morocco’s new water plan, which came into effect on January 14 and has a budget of MAD 115.4 billion (around $11.96 billion).

Just two days after the official launch of the plan, King Mohammed VI inaugurated several hydraulic, hydro-agricultural, and drinking water projects in the province of Essaouira, about 190 kilometers west of Marrakech.

The newly opened projects include the Moulay Abderrahmane dam on Oued (river) Ksoub, a hydro-agricultural development project on the downstream of the new dam, and other projects relating to the construction of a water treatment plant and strengthening access to drinking water in the region.

The Moulay Abderrahmane dam cost MAD 920 million (around $94.6 million).

Rabat – The Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC) projected a continued warming trend in Morocco. Every decade since 1970, the average temperature in Morocco increased by 0.5 °C, exceeding the global average by about 0.15 degrees.

Reports mention that temperatures in Morocco could keep increasing by up to 7 °C by 2100 unless serious preventive measures are taken.

Over the next 20 years, IPPC estimates Morocco will become more vulnerable to drought and other extreme weather events.

In order to prevent these consequences, Morocco has decided to adopt a new national program for water.

The Moroccan government signed the framework agreement for the implementation of the 2020-2027 national program for drinking and irrigation water supply on Monday, January 13.

King Mohammed VI, accompanied by Prince Moulay El Hassan, presided over the signing ceremony at the Royal Palace in Rabat.

The agreement defines the methods of implementing and financing the MAD 115.4 billion program.

The plan aims to consolidate and diversify Morocco’s drinking water supply, to guarantee water security, and to combat the effects of climate change.

During the ceremony, Minister of Equipment, Transport, Logistics, and Water, Abdelkader Amara, gave a speech outlining the program. The ministry, he said, developed the program, which revolves around five main actions, to combat the water situation in Morocco.

The program concerns improving water supply through building dams, with a budget of MAD 61 billion, managing demand and developing irrigation systems for the agricultural sector (MAD 25.1 billion), and securing drinking water supply in rural areas (MAD 26.9 billion).

The program also aims to reuse treated wastewater in the irrigation of green areas, with a budget of MAD 2.3 billion for it. Raising awareness about the importance of preserving water resources and rationalizing their use (MAD 50 million) is another key aspect of the plan, said the minister.

The general budget of the State will finance 60% of the program’s budget, while other stakeholders, mainly the National Office of Electricity and Drinking Water (ONEE) will fund 39% of the projects. As for the remaining 1%, it will be part of the public-private partnership, added Amara.

Appointing committee leaders

The official also announced the different committees to monitor the implementation of the program. Morocco’s Head of Government, Saad Eddine El Othmani, will chair a leading committee, while Amara will lead a technical committee. Finally, Governors of the different Moroccan regions are set to preside regional committees.

To improve water supply, the program is set to build 20 large dams with a storage capacity of 5.38 billion cubic meters. The dams will cost MAD 21.91 billion, said Amara, noting that the construction of the new dams will bring the overall water storage capacity of Morocco to 27.3 billion cubic meters.

The minister announced that several regional delegations have made an inventory of 909 sites that are likely to house small dams and hill dams. Morocco has currently 130 operating small dams and 20 still under construction, he added.

The program includes the exploration of groundwater to mobilize new resources and the construction of new seawater desalination stations. Morocco has already built four similar stations in the cities of Laayoune, Boujdour, Tan Tan, and Akhfenir, all in southern Morocco.

Two desalination stations are also already under construction in Agadir and Al Hoceima, while three others are scheduled in Casablanca, Dakhla, and Safi, concluded Amara.

Meanwhile, the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries, Rural Development, and Waters and Forests, Aziz Akhannouch, announced that the 2020-2027 program will supply irrigation water to an overall area of 510,000 hectares and will benefit 160,000 farmers.

The national plan allocates a budget of nearly MAD 9.5 billion to convert traditional irrigation systems into drip irrigation systems. The program plans to equip 350,000 hectares of agricultural land with new irrigation systems.

The plan will also ensure the continuation of the hydro-agricultural development project in the Saiss plain, northern Morocco, and the launch of a new development project in the southeastern part of the Gharb plain, northwestern Morocco.

Direct aid in rural areas

Speaking at the signing ceremony, the Interior Minister, Abdelouafi Laftit, stressed that the program aims to fight precariousness and water scarcity in some regions, especially during periods of drought.

The minister added that 7,876 villages will receive drinking water supply through 659 rural centers. The budget allocated for the centers is MAD 5 billion, while the estimated cost for generalizing drinking water supply to all villages is MAD 9.68 billion.

The program also aims to improve the output of distribution networks in cities and urban centers by 78% by 2027. The optimization of water infrastructure is expected to save nearly 207 million cubic meters of water. It would guarantee a continued supply of drinking water and an improvement in the quality of services.

Laftit added that the program is set to carry out liquid sanitation projects for the benefit of 128 cities and equip 1,207 rural centers with a sanitation network.

The first phase of the 2020-2027 program expects to mobilize 100 million cubic meters of water per year by 2027. The goal will be reached through the completion of 87 projects, including 22 for the irrigation of golf courses.

Amara, Laftit, and Akhannouch, along with Mohamed Benchaaboun, Minister of Economy, Finance, and Administrative Reform, Aziz Rabbah, Minister of Energy, Mining, and Environment, and Abderrahim El Hafidi, General Director of ONEE, have all signed the agreement.

Rabat – Just two days after the official launch of Morocco’s 2020-2027 water plan, King Mohammed VI inaugurated several hydraulic, hydro-agricultural, and drinking water projects in the province of Essaouira, about 190 kilometers west of Marrakech, on Thursday, January 16.

The newly opened projects include the “Moulay Abderrahmane” dam, on Oued (river) Ksoub, a hydro-agricultural development project on the downstream of the new dam, and other projects relating to the construction of a water treatment plant and strengthening access to drinking water in the region.

The new dam cost a budget of MAD 920 million (around €86 million). The hydro-agricultural development project, meanwhile, had a budget of MAD 238 million (about €22 million), while the other projects aiming to strengthen access to drinking water had a total budget of MAD 227 million (around €21 million).

The projects are in line with the objectives of the 2020-2027 National Drinking Water Supply and Irrigation Program, launched on Tuesday, January 14, with the aim of consolidating and diversifying the country’s drinking water supply. The plan aims to ensure water security and combat the effects of climate change.

“Moulay Abderrahmane” dam

The dam represents a continuity of the policy of dams, launched by the late King Hassan II, aiming to put the agricultural sector at the center of a balanced and sustainable economic growth in all Moroccan regions. The policy also hopes to promote rural areas through the development of their agricultural production systems.

The projects are set to improve the supply of drinking water to the city of Essaouira and the neighboring regions, preserve the province’s groundwater, and protect the areas and infrastructure located downstream of the dam from flooding. They will also increase the irrigated agricultural area and the agricultural production capacity.

The “Moulay Abderrahmane” dam is an embankment dam with a concrete mask. It is 72 meters high on foundation and 418 meters long at the crest, and it has a storage capacity of 65 million cubic meters.

The new hydraulic infrastructure brings the number of large dams in the region to six. The region’s economy is mainly based on agriculture, livestock, and handicrafts.

During the inauguration ceremony, the Minister of Equipment, Transport, Logistics, and Water, Abdelkader Amara, handed the King two medallions commemorating the event.

Amara announced that the dam will have two main missions. It will supply drinking water to a population of 250,000 people in the region and it will irrigate nearly 1,200 hectares of agricultural land.

Hydro-agricultural development project

The hydro-agricultural development project around the dam aims to take full advantage of the benefits provided by the new infrastructure. It will benefit 1,207 farmers in the rural communes of Ida Ougerd, Sidi El Jazouli, and Ounagha, announced the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries, Rural Development, Water, and Forests, Aziz Akhannouch.

The project, covering an area of 1,300 hectares, is set to increase agricultural production by nearly 125%, particularly for cereals, olives, pomegranates, and figs. It is also expected to increase the production value from 4,400 MAD/hectare/year (about €412) to 25,000 MAD/hectare/year (around €2346).

The new installations include a 12-kilometers-long main supply canal, along with a secondary and tertiary irrigation network, totaling 48 kilometers of canals. The development project also includes the construction of water intake points and treatment plants and providing support and technical assistance to farmers.

The King launched another irrigation operation on a six-hectare plot, before visiting a water filtration unit at the dam, a water intake unit, and a plot of land equipped with a drip irrigation system.

Securing drinking water supply

In parallel with the projects, the Moroccan government is completing an ongoing program to strengthen and secure the supply of drinking water to the urban and rural population of the Essaouira region. The program is expected to benefit more than 258,000 people by 2030.

So far, the program has supplied four rural communes in the Essaouira region with drinking water, through building a water treatment plant with a capacity of 250 liters per second and linking it to the villages through water pipelines. The communes have a total population of 33,000 inhabitants.

The project, costing MAD 135 million (around €13 million), takes into account the geographic assets of the region and benefits from the positioning of the dam, explained the Director-General of the National Office for Electricity and Drinking Water (ONEE), Abderrahim Hafidi.

A similar project with a budget of MAD 192 million (about €18 million) to supply 12 communes with drinking water is underway, and will be operating before the summer, added Hafidi. The project will benefit 65,000 inhabitants.

Finally, a third project to supply eight additional villages remains in the study phase, announced ONEE’s director.","Spread the loveRabat – Just two days after the official launch of Morocco’s 2020-2027 water plan, King Mohammed VI inaugurated several hydraulic, hydro-agricultural, and drinking water projects in the province of Essaouira, about 190 kilometers west of Marrakech, on Thursday, January 16.

528,https://africa.com/morocco-harvesting-water-fog/,How Morocco is Harvesting Water from Fog,"At first sight, these large black nets stretched vertically in the middle of nowhere have no reason to be. They do, however, fulfill a great mission: transforming fog into water. This unusual idea has changed the lives of the inhabitants of five villages in southwestern Morocco, who no longer have to travel several kilometers each day to fetch the precious liquid.

This unusual installation is located 1,225 meters above sea level, at the summit of the Boutmezguida mountain which overlooks five villages of the Sidi Ifni region. It is there that about forty huge nets have been facing a dense fog since 2014.

No More Suffering

In a remote region with a semi-arid climate, having water by opening a simple tap is a “revolution”, states Aïssa Derhem, president of the Dar Si Hmad organization. In Douar Id Achour, which is one of the five communities served, women and children lost an average of four hours a day by going back and forth to find water. This is even more common in summer, when water becomes rarer.

“I filled two 20-liter cans four times during the day, but those 160 liters were not enough for us because we have cattle,” says one of the inhabitants, Massouda Boukhalfa.

Thanks to this project, the inhabitants of the village are saving precious time that can now be put towards producing more argan oil- a product that is the reputation of the South Moroccan.

“Our wives and daughters do not get tired anymore, they go to school and are safe. With the time gained, they make argan oil”, says Lahcen Hammou Ali, 54 years.

NGOs in the Service of the Community

Led by women in the remote area, the Dar Si Hmad organization is the body that regulates this project. It is described as “the world’s largest operational fog-water harvesting system”. Dar Si Hmad designed and installed a “fog recycling” program, which is an innovative solution to persistent water stress in an area where fog is abundant. The technique is inspired by ancestral practices of harvesting dew water. This unique project resulted from a local initiative’s effort to adapt to climate change through provision of water, and combat the effects of desertification. Rains are rare in this region, but fog is everywhere. “For years, villagers have been wondering how to turn this moisture into water,” said Dar Si Hmad‘s president.

The organization wants to equip as many villages as possible and replace the existing nets with new models that are able to withstand a wind of 120 km/h.

“The nets are now exportable in other cities of Morocco- in all the mountainous regions, and on the waterfront”, declared Mr. Derhem, who dreams of one day spreading the project to all Moroccan sites full of fog.

The mission of this NGO is to ensure a sustainable living, as well as create opportunities to help low-income communities learn and prosper. With environmental education as the first step, the NGO promotes better understanding and management of natural resources. They also place their actions at the intersection between an ancestral knowledge of the natural world, and the advances of an enlightened contemporary science. The combination is what makes the protection of biodiversity and life on Earth an ultimate priority. With these concepts in mind, the idea of the project was born.

A Well-Developed Project

The system known as “cloud fishing” consists of trapping water droplets in 600m² of polypropylene sensor nets and storing them with a capacity of 539 m3. Liquid is then mixed with 30% groundwater to enrich itself with minerals, and flows through more than 10 000 m of pipes to the homes in surrounding villages. This results in 6,300 liters of water harvested each day. The system also supplies 80 to 100 households with 25 to 30 liters per person per day.

The principle of collecting fog water must follow three parameters: First, it must be in a region subject to a lot of fog. Second, it must be in an anticyclonic zone close to an ocean with cold water. Third, it is necessary to have a relief, or a natural obstacle, such as a high mountain that is between 500 and 600 meters above sea level. Fortunately, the conditions in Morocco have always been suitable for starting the project and spreading it to other countries. “Morocco has a lot of fog because of three phenomena: the presence of an anticyclone (the Azores), a cold maritime current, and the obstacle represented by the mountain,” explained the president of the NGO in charge of this initiative.

Three Phases

The story began in 2006, with the launch of the first experiment to assess potential water atop the Boutmezguida Mountain. In 2011, the results of the exploratory period were validated. This allowed 600 m² of nets to be built at the top of Boutmezguida mountain at 1225 m altitude.

In November 2014, the experimental phase was launched with partners, including the German Water Foundation (Wasserstiftung). In March 2015, the project was officially inaugurated.

A new generation of net fog sensors are currently linking 8 other villages to the grid with 1,700 m² of netting for 37,400 liters per day. These allow the inhabitants to save money by avoiding the purchases from tank trucks. They also save the enduring marches, in various weather conditions, to fetch water.

Symbolically, the valves were opened for the first time on the twenty-first of March 2014, World Water Day. “More than 100 households, or almost 500 people, have since received running water to their homes”, explained Mounir Abbar, in charge of the technical management of the project.

An Award-Winning Project

The project got the United Nations Momentum for Change Climate Change Award during the latest COP 22 organized in Marrakech. Ban Ki-Moon, the UN Secretary General, attended the event alongside Bertrand Piccard, pilot of the Solar Impulse solar aircraft.

The Momentum for Change initiative is led by the UN secretariat on climate change to highlight some of the most innovative, evolving, and replicable examples of what people are doing to fight climate change. Today’s announcement is part of wider efforts to mobilize action and ambition, while national governments are working on the implementation of the Paris Climate Change Accord and the sustainable development.

529,https://minorityrights.org/morocco-an-amazigh-communitys-long-wait-for-water-rights/,Morocco: An Amazigh community’s long wait for water rights,"On a remote foothill in the Atlas mountains, 200 miles from Marrakesh and above Morocco’s largest silver mine, a group of Amazigh activists live in basic conditions in tiny huts. They come from the nearby village of Imider, home to a community of Amazigh, an ethnic group indigenous to North Africa. The activists rarely leave their outpost in the mountains, for they are staging one of the country’s longest running protests against environmental harm caused by the mine, in the hope they can continue to live in their homes.

‘Since the silver mine was established a couple of decades ago, access to water for Imider residents has been severely reduced,’ says Linda Fouad, an Amazigh activist who supports the protest. ‘The land has deteriorated significantly, destroying agriculture and livelihoods. Pollution has tremendously increased, and health and water were affected by the toxic waste from the mine. Moreover, the mine has had a deep negative impact on the traditional underground water system in Imider called khettarat.’

Amazigh have long faced marginalization in Morocco. The village lacks basic infrastructure such as schools and hospitals, and if Amazigh children want to continue their studies beyond primary education they have to travel miles to do so. Yet on their doorstep is the Imider silver mine, owned by Société Nationale d’Investissement (SNI), a private holding company belonging to the Moroccan royal family. The mine is the most productive in Africa, a fact that places a heavy strain on local resources: according to a 2015 report by the Global Amazigh Congress, the mine uses 1,555 tonnes of water per day – 12 times the daily consumption of the village.

The people of Imider therefore decided, seven years ago, to protest against the reduced access to water and environmental degradation by setting up a camp and closing a pipeline supplying water to the mine. Since then, with campaigners so far having stopped some 3 million tonnes of water from reaching the mine, agricultural production has improved and water in the khettarats has risen again. This is why the activists in the mountains do not leave the outpost: they need to keep the valve closed.

The movement, known as the Movement on the Road ’96 (referring to a similar protest that took place in 1996), is larger than the small group of activists who live permanently in the mountains. This group is often joined by many more supporters: Imider residents stage regular marches and assemblies (called agraw) at the camp, to show solidarity and discuss strategies for the campaign. And in recent years, as the movement has gained international attention, journalists, activists and academics from abroad have also spent time at the camp.

But within Morocco, the plight of Imider’s Amazigh community is not discussed. ‘It’s also a delicate issue because the company is private but it’s also owned by the ruling family so the media refrain from reporting on the situation,’ says Fouad. ‘No one dares to speak about it.’

In response to the peaceful protest the authorities have arrested and imprisoned activists. According to Fouad, between 2011 and 2017, 33 activists have been arrested on ‘groundless and fabricated charges’, and the three last detainees were only released in December 2017.

‘Activists are being imprisoned, just for demanding clean water, no pollution, and for the company to respect international environmental standards,’ says Fouad. ‘We’re not asking the company to close the mine, we simply want them to respect their corporate social responsibility. If they have taken all the silver, at least they can give something back to the village – helping with the infrastructure, building up schools, stopping the arrests of the activists and respecting the environmental conditions.’

To date, despite years of protests, the community’s demands have been ignored. Recently the arrests have ceased, but the community has received no response from the government or the mining company to their campaign. Closing the valve has been rendered symbolic as the company has found other ways to access water, so continuing to degrade the land.

Nevertheless, despite the threat of being displaced because of the environmental effects of the mine, the community stands firm. In recent years, the community has begun to take their demands to the international community and has been building solidarity with foreign academics, journalists and NGOs. The activists brought their concerns to the UN Climate Change Convention’s annual conference (‘COP 22’), held in Marrakesh in 2016, which helped raise the international profile of the situation.

Fouad says that, despite the lack of will on the part of the state to help, the activists will not give up. ‘The company is still draining water, and the fields are no longer as green as they were 30 years ago. Yet, the Amazigh activists go on. Every time I go to the protest camp you see how powerful people are. Many activists want to go there and deliver “empowerment training” but they soon realize that the protesters don’t need it. They are the ones who empower us. They don’t need any strength because they are already very strong.’

The residents of Zagora and its environs, however, continue to suffer from a water shortage. Environmental activists in the region have begun to step up their efforts, with the aim of forcing the Moroccan state into taking measures to solve the crisis. A particular focus of the campaign is to limit the cultivation of watermelons, which require quantities of water, in this arid, semi-desert area.

""I spend hours in front of this small well, for a few litres of water. It’s barely enough for me to drink ... I no longer think of washing myself. That is something I and my children can only dream about."" This is how Aisha, a 45-year-old housewife, describes the impact of the water crisis on her life.



The scarcity of water haunts the inhabitants of Zagora, which in Morocco's southeast, on the border with Algeria. Aicha, who lives in ""the parched district"" of Zagora, adds: ""We stand at the wells and wait for long hours, especially in summer. Our suffering is multiplied when we don’t find water for drinking or even cleaning, and this has led to our children getting ill.""

Measures adopted by the state to solve the water crisis

Owing to the drought and the desertification, most of the town's menfolk have moved away from Zagora in order to seek jobs in the cities. The women and children are left behind to deal with the shortage of water. Fatima, a 60-year-old woman who also lives in the ""parched district"" in Zagora, says:In 2017 the first spark of the “thirst revolution” in Zagora erupted in the “parched district”. The residents turned out to demand their right to drinking water. This resulted in the arrest of almost 23 of them and the state prosecutor brought charges against them of ""gathering and engaging in an unauthorised march.""In response to the crisis, the “Association of the Friends of the Environment (Zagora)” is working to find environmental solutions that will provide residents with access to safe drinking water.says Jamal Akchbab, the association's president.The association held a series of meetings to explain to residents and officials the implications of climate change for the region.Jamal Akchbab adds: “As Akchbab explains, the causes of water scarcity include demographic pressure on water resources as well as poor management and the misuse of water. He also points out that there is a lack of vision and that the state has no plan or strategy to meet the challenges and achieve water security.He adds:Moroccan King Mohammed VI warned officials about the water crisis and ordered them to form a body to address the situation and to provide drinking water for all.The Association of the Friends of the Environment, however, says that the situation has worsened and that the crisis has even spread to areas in northern and central Morocco.While the inhabitants of Zagora are suffering from shortages of potable water and inadequate rainfall, this dry and semi-desert area is known for the cultivation of fresh, sweet-tasting watermelon and this requires large amounts of water.As Akchbab says:The Association of the Friends of the Environment (Zagora) has issued multiple appeals to the authorities to relieve the people’s suffering and regulate watermelon cultivation.The association revealed figures for the area of land under watermelon cultivation in the region, noting that production had exceeded all expectations this year. According to these figures, the number of hectares allocated to the crop exceeded 24,000 and production exceeded 1 million tons. In the process, this agriculture used more than 30 million cubic meters of groundwater, which is also the source of the drinking water.Zagora is the first region in Morocco to harvest watermelons in May each year, and the melons, which contain 92% water, are the first to hit both Moroccan and European markets.Rainfall in the area does not exceed two to three days throughout the growing season, with an annual average of less than 61 mm.The Association warned repeatedly of the dangers of cultivating watermelons in an area called Fayja, which is regarded as a local source of potable water. However, these warnings went unheeded, and this has led to the drying up of wells and exacerbated the shortage of drinking water.The association said that it has made major efforts to limit watermelon cultivation and to regulate it through a series of seminars and study days, in addition to making presentations at various levels.It expressed its deep regret, furthermore, that its recommendations and ideas were not taken into consideration.

Indeed, production is continuing to expand, stretching all the way to Tata in the south.Pressure from environmental activists in Zagora on the relevant authorities has prompted the Moroccan state to take some measures to address the issue. These include support for the exploration of groundwater and the completion of more than 75 test wells over the past 5 years in co-operation with the Souss-Massa Draa Hydro Agency. This has provided water to make up the deficit in the supply of drinking water to rural areas.It is notable that the central water authorities, with the co-operation of the Reservoir Agency and associated bodies, have produced a number of studies relating to water purification in rural areas with a full cost estimate of MAD 2 million (€ 187,000).","When residents of Zagora in southern Morocco protested in 2017, demanding the right to safe drinking water, the authorities arrested 23 of them in what became known as the ""thirst revolution"".

The coronavirus pandemic is putting an unprecedented strain not only on the health sector and the economy, but on water resources too.

Reliable water supplies play an important role in combating the spread of the virus. In countries where water is in short supply, such as Morocco, simple acts of hygiene can place the infrastructure under considerable strain

Realising that drinking water infrastructure in urban and rural areas urgently needed improving and expanding, in order to cope with this rise in consumption, the National Office for Electricity and Drinking Water (ONEE) in Morocco sped up the construction of a water treatment plant funded by the EBRD.

The new facility has a capacity of 250 litres per second. And thanks to a 40 km extension of pipes, the network is providing drinking water to over 140,000 people in the city of Ouarzazate, southern central Morocco, and neighbouring villages.

This expansion will improve people’s health by allowing them to enjoy clean drinking water and practice basic hygiene. It will also help to improve the lives of many citizens, in particular women, who represent the majority of those sourcing water, a laborious and time-consuming undertaking.

Morocco started implementing strict public health measures in mid-March after the first Covid-19 infections had been detected in the country. Since the imposition of the lockdown, ONEE has been able to maintain a continuous supply of drinking water in the country, helping to limit the spread of the virus.

The Ouarzazate project is part of a €65 million investment programme financed by the EBRD to improve the drinking water supply to three medium-sized Moroccan cities and 260 rural communities in the regions of Azilal, Ben Guerir and Ouarzazate, including a nationwide programme for performance improvement.

The investment is supported by a €4.5 million comprehensive technical assistance programme jointly designed by the EBRD and ONEE to address corporate governance issues, and funded by the Federal Ministry of Finance of Austria, the EBRD’s SEMED Multi-Donor Account (Australia, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Taipei China and the United Kingdom ) .

Bank Al Maghrib, Morocco’s central bank, forecast economic growth of 3.8% for the current year while the Moroccan Centre of Conjuncture (CMC) predicted 4.6% growth after a disappointing 2.9% growth in 2019, which was blamed largely on a significant drop in agricultural output because of insufficient rainfall in early 2019.

The CMC’s forecast was based on an increase of more than 10% in agricultural value added at the end of the current agricultural year. However, the CMC’s gamble was dealt a blow by data that suggest that since the end of December, the country is showing a rainfall deficit of 37.6% compared to 2018-19.

Cereal production for last year decreased 49% compared to the exceptional 2017-18 season. Production totalled 5.2 million tonnes, far lower than the 6.1 million tonnes forecast by the Agriculture and Fisheries Ministry.

Morocco spent $960 million on wheat imports in 2019 compared to $950 million in 2018, while corn imports reached $540 million last year compared to $480 million the year before.

Wheat production in Morocco should amount to 4 million tonnes during the current season, 42% less than the 2018-19 season, forecasts by the US Department of Agriculture stated.

In 2014, cereal crops in Morocco occupied 65% of the country’s agricultural area, said the Policy Centre for the New South, a Moroccan think-tank.

Since 2008, the Green Morocco Plan agricultural strategy has sought to decrease the weight of cereals in agricultural added value by developing sectors with higher added value, such as fruit, to help farmers overcome the inconsistent weather patterns.

Farm income is volatile in semi-arid Morocco where climate change has caused droughts and summer flash floods in some areas.

The High Commission for Planning of Morocco forecast a 4.3% drop in agricultural value added and economic growth of 2.3% because of the drop in cereal production.

With no precipitation forecast nationwide in the short term and unusually high temperatures in February, prospects of a good agricultural campaign were evaporating, which experts said would have dire consequences on small farmers, exacerbate rural exodus and slow economic growth.

Agriculture accounts for more than 15% of Morocco’s GDP and employs 40% of the workforce.

The Moroccan government has frozen customs duties of 35% on wheat imports from January 2-April 30 following rising prices on wheat and diminishing stocks on the international market.

Morocco was ranked the 22nd-most water-stressed country in a report by the World Resources Institute. Morocco’s water stress is defined at 1,000-1,700 cubic metres of available freshwater per person per year, the UN Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA) said.

By 2025, the country’s water security is expected to worsen to a condition of “water scarcity,” with predictions of less than 1,000 cubic metres of available freshwater per person per year, said the UNECA.

Morocco has introduced a $12 billion programme that includes dam building, improving water consumption, preserving of water resources and increasing supply in rural areas.

Moroccan Agriculture Minister Aziz Akhannouch said the 2020-27 programme would supply irrigation water to 510,000 hectares and benefit 160,000 farmers.

SEBT EL GUERDANE, Morocco – On a plot of farmland where goats wander among the weeds, a two-story house made of stone and concrete looks out over what was once a lush grove of orange trees. Now those trees have been ripped from the ground, leaving bare earth and dead stumps.

Groundwater has been severely overpumped by farms in Morocco’s Souss-Massa region, and the water table has fallen dramatically. When the family’s well dried up, their farm was transformed into barren land.

The orange grove’s disappearance nearly five years ago eliminated the main source of income for Mbarek Belkadi, his three brothers, and their families. They’ve turned to whatever work they can find, often buying and selling fruit. Earning enough to survive has become a constant struggle.

“All this land was irrigated with this well. Now it’s dead,” Mbarek said, standing beside piles of dry branches. “It’s finished here.”

As the family crowded around their old well, they pulled back the metal cover. A rusty cable lay in a heap next to it. This cable, they explained, was used to lower people into the hole to dig deeper. They dug down to more than 600 feet, and then gave up as the water level kept dropping. They could no longer afford a more powerful pump to lift the water from so far underground.

Alongside farms that are still pumping from deep wells, many fields around the town of Sebt El Guerdane lie parched and abandoned. The faint patterns of ridges and furrows spread out across the soil, with only a stubble of weeds pushing through the hardened crust.

The overpumping of groundwater in this part of Morocco is symptomatic of a pervasive trend across North Africa and the Middle East. Much more water is being drained from the ground than is naturally recharged, and aquifers have been declining in countries from Tunisia to Iran to the Arabian Peninsula.

Natural springs that once gushed into oases in the desert have dried up and disappeared in places across the region. As pumping has driven groundwater levels lower, some wells have been abandoned and farmlands have turned to dust.

“In all these countries, groundwater is going down – no exception,” said Mohamed Aboufirass, a hydrogeologist who heads the Moroccan engineering consulting firm Resing. “We have to do something about it. And I think most of the governments in this region are aware of this. Morocco’s certainly is trying to.”

In fact, the Moroccan government has done more than most to combat its groundwater depletion problem. The government has invested in capturing more surface water and directing it to recharge aquifers. It’s promoting regional aquifer plans, charging many well owners based on how much they pump, and providing subsidies to encourage farmers to switch to water-saving irrigation systems.

The government helped back the construction of a water pipeline that carries water from dams to some of the citrus groves around Sebt El Guerdane. The distribution network from that pipeline, though, doesn’t reach Mbarek’s farm, so the family has been unable to buy the water.

They’ve managed to keep alive a couple rows of lemon trees using small amounts of water from the same municipal pipes that supply homes in the area. The lemon trees don’t produce nearly enough to support the family.

“We are out hustling every day, trying to earn some money to bring it home,” Mbarek said. “But it’s always hard to find work because all the farmers around here have the same problem.”

Morocco is a land of springs. Water that originates as rainfall and snow high in the Atlas Mountains filters down through fissures in the rocks and runs in streams, seeping into the aquifers of the lowlands.

Farming towns have for generations depended on the streams gushing from the ground. But in the Souss-Massa plain, some springs have dwindled and stopped flowing. In farming villages near the town of Oulad Berhil, several water holes have vanished.

“The springs were coming from there, where the palms are,” said a man who declined to give his name, motioning to date palms growing in a depression surrounded by plowed fields.

Down a meandering dirt road, another dry spring has become a grassy pit filled with trash. It stopped flowing about 15 years ago.

For centuries, Moroccans dug underground irrigation tunnels called khettaras to capture and guide flows of groundwater to their fields. In many areas, the khettaras no longer flow and have been abandoned.

“We used to get water from the spring on the mountain,” said Khadija Bouanek, a woman who was harvesting olives on the side of the road. “We used to go with mules to bring water for drinking.”

Speaking in Arabic through an interpreter, she explained that the spring went dry about a decade ago. That natural source of water was replaced with an artificial one when the government built a drinking water system that brings water from a well to people’s homes.

In parts of the Souss-Massa plain, groundwater levels have declined more than 200 feet, and that has had major consequences for farmers who have run out, said Nour-Eddine Laftouhi, a professor of hydrogeology at Cadi Ayyad University in Marrakech.

Many rural people have been driven from their lands by the lack of water and have resettled in cities. Laftouhi said the entire country has seen “this phenomenon of migration from the rural areas to cities – because of water, because of drought, because of the depletion of water.” In places, he said, it’s because the springs that once sustained communities no longer exist.“In some areas of Morocco, it’s a very catastrophic situation,” Laftouhi said. “In some other regions, we have a rise up of the water level because of the introduction of irrigation systems, but this rise up of water level is not sufficient to balance, to counterbalance the depletion.”

Near the western edge of the Sahara, the fertile alluvial plains at the base of the Atlas Mountains stretch out into some of the country’s most productive farmlands – greenhouses filled with tomatoes, fields of strings beans and olive trees.

Vast citrus groves produce navel and Valencia oranges, clementines and lemons. The fruit is sold in Russia, the Netherlands and other European countries, as well as the United States and Canada. Some of that fruit comes from the large groves around the towns of Sebt El Guerdane and Taroudant.

At one citrus grove, farmer Tarik Ait Hessi said he has access to water from the pipeline but prefers to pump water from wells because it’s less expensive.

“We have to dig deep, like 250 meters underground, to find the water,” Ait Hessi said, standing beside the orange trees.

Outside the walls of his orchard sits an abandoned farm. He said when the water level fell, the farm’s owners could not afford a new pump to draw water from such depths, so they left to look for work elsewhere.

“Moving on is better than staying there and suffering,” Ait Hessi said.

Where the orchard used to stand, a lone tree remains in the field of barren furrows.

At Mbarek’s farm, the children used to help pick the oranges and lemons to sell. Now there’s relatively little work to do on the farm other than feeding the goats and three cows.

His 26-year-old nephew Mustafa found a job in construction. His 19-year-old nephew Khalid is working as an industrial electrician.

“I want my kids to stay attached to the land and not sell it, to try to work the land even though it’s a hard time,” said Zahra Boulaich, Mbarek’s wife, whose youngest son is 14.

Mbarek explained that when the well first dried up, they dug deeper, about 30 feet at a time, until they reached more than 600 feet. Even then, they didn’t find water to pump.

“I felt so sad when I had to take the trees from the ground, but I had to do it,” Mbarek said. After that, the brothers went to large farms to look for work. One of them started buying and selling fruit and vegetables.

As the family stood around the old well, Mustafa held up a broken piece of a mirror and reflected a shaft of sunlight down into the well. Other boys threw in rocks and listened to them ricochet off the walls until they hit the bottom with a faint thud.

“There’s nothing to do here anymore,” said Abdel Kabir Belkadi, Mbarek’s brother.

The family owns another piece of farmland but has been renting it out because they don’t have enough money to invest. They tried to form a farming cooperative but couldn’t make it work.

Across the road, another farmer had just ripped out his orchard. The stumps has been sawed into pieces and lay in piles. Workers were loading the wood onto the back of a truck.

The dead trees are hauled out into the desert and left in mounds. Men shovel a layer of dirt atop the mounds and burn them, sending off smoke as the wood is turned into charcoal.

As groundwater has been depleted across the Middle East and North Africa, natural springs have gone dry in many places that were once desert oases. In a 2013 report published by the United Nations Development Program, researchers listed some of those lost springs – in Syria’s Palmyra oasis as well as springs in Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Libya, western Egypt, southern Algeria and southern Tunisia.

Farming consumes about 85 percent of the water that is used in Arab countries, and agricultural water use rose an estimated 32 percent in the region between 1995 and 2013, researcher Waleed Zubari of the Arabian Gulf University said in another report. He said much of the water that flows to farms is being wasted due to inefficient irrigation methods.

“We have to practice agriculture wisely,” Zubari said. “We have to minimize the losses in agriculture.”

He and other scientists have warned that the region is vulnerable to climate change, which is increasing the pressures on water supplies in the same areas where aquifers are receding.

As water scarcity worsens, it threatens to limit countries’ development, shrink farming areas and contribute to the sorts of tensions that have already erupted into conflicts in Syria, Yemen and elsewhere.

“I think the worst-case scenario is already playing out in the Middle East, in Syria,” said Jay Famiglietti, a professor at the University of California, Irvine, who studies groundwater depletion around the world using satellite measurements. Famiglietti, who is also the senior water scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, pointed out that while the war in Syria is about much more than water, the tensions that led up to it were aggravated by severe drought, declines in groundwater and the government’s failure to provide water for agriculture. Many farmers were forced to abandon their lands and move to cities, and resentment festered.

Using measurements from NASA’s GRACE satellites, a team including Katalyn Voss, Famiglietti and other scientists found that the north-central Middle East encompassing the Tigris-Euphrates region lost about 144 cubic kilometers of freshwater – an amount comparable to the Dead Sea – between 2003 and 2009.

They estimated that 60 percent of those water losses in Turkey, Syria, Iraq and Iran were due to groundwater depletion, largely water pumped from wells for farms. Turkey has also been holding back water in massive reservoirs, reducing the flows in rivers and contributing to falling groundwater levels downstream.

The satellite data also reveal enormous losses of groundwater beneath the Arabian Peninsula and across the Sahara, where Algeria, Libya and Tunisia are drawing down their aquifers.

Many of the countries in North Africa and the Middle East rely on “fossil” aquifers that contain water deposited long ago when the climate was wetter. Scientists have estimated that water pumped from the Nubian Sandstone Aquifer System in western Egypt has been underground for ages ranging from hundreds of thousands of years to more than a million years. As that water is drained from the ground, the aquifer is irreversibly diminished.

In places, those changes are visible aboveground as lakes recede. Lake Urmia in western Iran, for instance, has shrunk dramatically, mainly due to diversions of surface water but also due partly to groundwater depletion. In Ethiopia, Lake Haramaya has mostly dried up, and researchers say its decline was partly caused by groundwater pumping for the thirsty crop khat, a leafy plant that people chew as a stimulant in parts of East Africa and Yemen.

Tracing exactly how tensions over water contribute to larger conflicts can be difficult. But falling groundwater levels are a major problem in some of the same countries where conflicts are raging, including Yemen. There, khat farms have long been draining groundwater, and water tables have fallen to perilous lows.

“We don’t see wars over water. But what we see is water is a contributing factor to conflicts that may start for another reason. They may be the straw that breaks the camel’s back,” said Peter Gleick, a water researcher who is president of the Pacific Institute and has studied how drought and mismanagement of water contributed to the conflict in Syria.

His organization keeps a detailed chronology of water-related conflicts around the world. In 2014, the incidents ranged from deadly protests over water shortages in South Africa to clashes over land and water sources pitting herders against farmers in Nigeria.

“Conflicts over water turn violent when institutions fail,” Gleick said. “That’s one of the reasons in fact why more and more of the water conflicts we’ve seen in recent years have been sub-national conflicts and not between nations, because nations have diplomats, nations negotiate treaties, nations go to war only as a last resort. But ethnic groups, communities are much more likely to resort to violence if they feel they have no other recourse.”

Some conflicts can simmer for years when groups of farmers or towns argue over water.

In Morocco, the village of Assads has a longstanding grievance with farmers who divert water from a spring upstream. The town’s mosque stands high above a dry riverbed in a valley where the mountains rise from the Souss-Massa plain. All around Assads, old irrigation canals are dry and strewn with rocks.

Terraced fields have been abandoned, leaving them dotted with the dry stumps of dead date palm trees.

Yazid Nait, who grew up in the town, said he remembers there used to be plenty of water to grow grapes and other crops. Then a longstanding water-sharing agreement between the villages broke down.

“They take all the water,” Nait said of the farmers upstream. He said that without water, his village has withered and many people have moved away.

Nait, who now lives in the United States and was back home for a visit, set out on foot for the spring, hiking through a deep canyon where seasonal downpours have sculpted the steep rock walls in smooth, undulating patterns. He passed citron farms on the hillsides where the canals were brimming with water and croaking frogs.

At the spring, the water gushed from a cavernous opening in the rocks into a dammed pool. Nait squatted down and splashed the cool water with a hand.

“It’s pure water,” he said. “We need somebody to manage it well and give it to the other people. That’s it.”

Large-scale acquisitions of farmland are on the rise, and many land deals are occurring in Africa as agribusiness companies and other foreign investors move in to secure land with ample water supplies.

Those deals are being tracked by researchers through an initiative called Land Matrix, a database that shows substantial and growing investments in Africa.

Saudi Arabian, Indian and Chinese companies have acquired farmlands in Sudan. Companies from Portugal and the United Arab Emirates have started farming operations in Egypt. And companies from Israel, Austria, Turkey and other countries have signed deals for land in Ethiopia.

Some researchers have labeled it “water grabbing” and have sought to quantify the amounts of water involved. Others have raised concerns about how rural communities will be affected as large companies move in and pump water to their fields.

In Ethiopia, the government has been promoting increased tapping of groundwater to boost food production. Seifu Kebede, a water scientist at Addis Ababa University, said less than 75,000 acres are irrigated with groundwater today and the government plans to increase that to nearly 5 million acres.

If the groundwater boom goes unregulated, Ethiopia will face some of the same pitfalls that other countries are grappling with, Kebede said. He cited severe depletion problems in India and parts of the United States such as California.

“So there should be a balance, some level of regulation,” he said.

In a 2012 report published by the Rome-based International Land Coalition, a team of researchers concluded that Africa has become a prime target of investment in the land rush and that the “rights and livelihoods of rural communities are being put in jeopardy by the prevailing model of large-scale land acquisition.”

They called for governments and investors to not only recognize the land and water rights of small farmers but to also provide them with assistance and financing. They recommended “enforceable limits” on the extraction of water based on assessments of how much can be used sustainably.

That didn’t happen around Sebt El Guerdane, where small farmers were put out of business while big farms continued pumping.

Down the road from Mbarek and Zahra’s farm, neighbor Ibrahim Akroud said that since his well ran dry, he has been hiring out his tractor for jobs on large farms.

“Everybody is out of work in this area,” he said, sitting on his tractor. “And those who are left don’t have money and are hoping for better days.”

Elsewhere, near Taroudant, the government has helped small farmers by drilling deep wells that supply their fields. Mohamed Amine El Khesoini said he and his family used to struggle to find enough water to farm, but those problems went away when the government drilled the wells two years ago. A cooperative administers the wells and charges farmers for the water they use.

“Everybody prefers to be on the government infrastructure,” El Khesoini said. His family sells their turnips and other vegetables at the weekly souk, where farmers spread out their produce on tables along with boxes of dates and bags of spices.

Another government program supports farmers with subsidies, paying those with small landholdings up to 100 percent of the cost of switching to drip irrigation or other efficient systems.

Some large farms are also adopting more efficient irrigation systems out of necessity in order to control pumping costs and keep their wells running.

At one orange grove near Taroudant, manager Abdel Majid Etaouil said the farm already uses drip irrigation and is starting to experiment with underground tubing that sends water directly to the roots.

Standing next to the farm’s irrigation pond, he said the groundwater has declined and the farm’s pump had to be lowered deeper into the well.

“The big change was these last six months,” he said. If the water table keeps falling, they will soon have to drill deeper.

Morocco has about 135 dams. Most of them were built during the rule of King Hassan II from 1961 to 1999, when the government’s water policies were focused largely on expanding the country’s water storage capacity and bringing drinking water to more Moroccans.

In the latter part of his rule, the government’s emphasis began to shift toward managing water supplies. A national water law passed in 1995 created river basin agencies and gave them responsibility for developing water management plans and monitoring groundwater use, among other tasks.

Because much more groundwater is being pumped than can naturally be recharged, the Souss-Massa river basin agency has a long-term plan to bring that deficit into balance, said Hamza El Himri, head of the agency’s sustainable water management division. “We’re trying to make up for this deficit and keep underground resources as strategic sources.”

He said the plan is based on halting the expansion of irrigated land, promoting conservation and moving toward the use of more treated wastewater and desalinated water.

The government is backing the construction of a desalination plant in Chtouka that will draw in seawater from the Atlantic and churn out water for agriculture – more than 100,000 cubic meters per day, or 26 million gallons. The aquifer has fallen nearly 100 feet beneath farms in Chtouka, and the area is in danger of losing its water supply due to saltwater intrusion. The desalination plant is intended to keep lucrative greenhouses in business and, at a cost, lessen the strains on the aquifer.

The Moroccan government, both under Hassan II and now under King Mohammed VI, has declared groundwater to be a strategic resource. In its national water strategy, the government lists the preservation of groundwater as a priority and calls for the reduction of pumping from overexploited aquifers. The document also emphasizes “participation, involvement and accountability” in managing groundwater.

Government officials acknowledge that some of their efforts have failed and that a great deal more needs to be done. Abdeslam Ziyad, the national director of water research and planning, said most of the country’s aquifers are still being overexploited and attempts at controls have been ineffective. So the government is instead promoting an approach that involves engaging farmers and other water users and having them participate in deciding how to address the problem. They are working on regional plans called aquifer “contracts,” in which government officials and water users meet to diagnose the issues facing their aquifers and then agree collectively on actions to take.

“There are solutions, but to succeed with this proposition, you cannot be too ambitious with the contracts,” Ziyad said. “We must be modest, and not have too many objectives.”

In the first attempts at contracts, it became clear that for farmers and others to meet the goals of reducing pumping, the bar couldn’t be set too high, Ziyad said. “The most important thing is to stop the hemorrhaging, not to continue with the same trend of overexploitation.”

He said the government is focusing on projects to artificially recharge aquifers by capturing surface water and directing it to areas where aquifers are depleted. But that has a relatively small impact and raising groundwater levels can take many years. So he said the government’s strategy emphasizes limiting pumping through the contracts, which are signed by participants once they are finalized.

Even with those agreements, the challenges are monumental, especially because large farms have the ability to keep pumping while small farmers often don’t.

“That is the big problem with groundwater resources: if we do not exploit this resource, there are neighbors who will exploit it,” Ziyad said. “And so it is a race for exploitation.”

While trying to raise awareness, water regulators don’t plan to give up on enforcement. They are developing a monitoring system that uses satellite images to track any expansion of farmland. If an area that was previously brown turns green in the satellite images, they will be able to crack down on violators that are pumping more without permission.

Much of Morocco’s export crops are grown in the Souss-Massa region, where agriculture accounts for about 90 percent of the water consumption.

There are more than 25,000 wells in operation, and that’s only the number with permits, said Lhoussaine Bouchaou, a hydrogeologist at Ibn Zohr University in Agadir. He said many other wells have been drilled illegally and the groundwater has been so severely depleted that recharging the system would take a very long time.

He and other experts say the country has made significant progress. Aboufirass, whose consulting firm deals with water management, said the advantage of using aquifer contracts is that all parties are involved in the diagnosis and there is buy-in to work toward objectives.

He said government subsidies are also helping more farmers switch to drip irrigation.

“If we save let’s say 10 percent by bringing drip irrigation, or 20 percent, that’s like building a dam,” Aboufirass said. “So we are in the learning curve, but I think we are getting somewhere.”

More still needs to be done to encourage farmers to install new irrigation systems and switch to crops that use less water, said Laila Mandi, director of the National Research Center on Water and Energy at Cadi Ayyad University. She said the river basin agencies also need more funding and staff to effectively enforce limits on pumping.

“Everything must be changed to cope with this problem and to stop this,” Mandi said. “We have to preserve these resources for the future.”

Morocco’s struggles mirror problems of declining aquifers around the world.

Most aquifers are poorly monitored and poorly managed, so improving monitoring is one of the first steps that needs to be taken, Famiglietti said. He said there is tremendous potential for improving efficiency in agriculture.

“We need to be thinking about more judicious crop choices, growing the right things in the right places,” Famiglietti said. “We need to be thinking about water pricing and charging the true value for water.”

If the world doesn’t take action to change course, he said, the results will be abysmal. More farmers are likely to be displaced. Depletion could lead to the collapse of farming regions. Water could become a source of greater conflict.

In many areas, the quantities of water that can be tapped haven’t been well studied. Famiglietti said that means people are “flying blind, and that is incredibly risky.”

He called for exploration of the world’s major aquifers and said the United States ought to have a coordinated national water plan.

“I think one of the biggest things that has to happen is that people, the general population needs to really take ownership of this problem, really understand how heavily we rely on groundwater and really push for its sustainability over the long-term,” Famiglietti said. “It’s a very challenging problem because we’re basically addicted to groundwater and there is no one there to help. Globally, there’s no one there to help wean us off the groundwater.”

Famiglietti said one of the biggest hurdles to addressing groundwater depletion problems on a global scale is the lack of a body where scientists and others can work on solutions.

Famiglietti suggested creating a coordinated global conversation about water – a body that would parallel the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change or the equivalent of a Kyoto Protocol for water.

It may be just a matter of time, he said, until the world needs to hold its first global summit on groundwater.

In Burundi, a tiny African country nestled between Rwanda, Tanzania and the Democratic Republic of Congo, residents face great difficulties accessing clean water.

Ironically, Burundi possesses abundant water resources. Access to clean water and other water-related sanitation problems was reduced by four civil wars that Burundi experienced since 1962. In 1965, the Hutu-Tutsi ethnic struggle began when a Hutu insurgent group attempted to seize political power.

In 1972, thousands of Tutsis died and educated Hutus fled Burundi. The result impacted the regulatory system and finances of Burundi with regards to the water quality. Furthermore, the thousands of displaced people became infected with water-related diseases.

The water connections in Burundi were ravaged during the wars and neglected due to a lack of financial capital. Many kilometers of water pipes, as well as 80 percent of installed water meters, were destroyed after each war. Residents are now forced to collect untreated water from sources like rivers, lakes, shallow wells, water haulers and standpipes.

Waterborne diseases are significant issues, with 68 percent to 76 percent of illnesses traced to limited safe drinking water. Contracting waterborne diseases also increased the mortality rate in Burundi.

The government is attempting to improve the water quality in Burundi. For example, in 2000, the government adopted laws breaking up the monopoly over sanitation services. The government also introduced a new regulatory framework to aid the improvement of water quality in Burundi.

The Water and Electric Authority (REGIDESCO) is another arm of the government attempting to improve the water quality in Burundi. REGISDESCO made 29,700 water connections and 49 standpipe connections in Bujumbura, the capital of Burundi. Additionally, REGISDESCO made 1,500 new water connections in the capital before 2010, and suggested further new water connections for this decade.

Unfortunately, the overall performance of REGIDESCO is not satisfactory. REGIDESCO is not doing well financially. Nonpayment of water bills, especially by public sector users, inhibits REGIDESCO from improving the water quality in Burundi.

Still, there is hope. One of the government’s goals is the rehabilitation of the drinking water supply. Another important priority is to improve the hygiene and sanitation in both urban and rural areas. In fact, since 1990, 1.2 million people gained access to improved sanitation. The government also hopes to provide one covered indoor latrine and one public latrine in each public establishment in rural areas, where residents struggle even more to obtain clean water.

There are also donors helping to improve the water quality in Burundi ever since the democratic elections of 2005. For example, the African Development Bank (AfDB) launched an $18 million project to assess water and sanitation resources throughout Burundi.

The enthusiasm to improve water quality in Burundi may encourage a global effort to further address the issue.

The impact of River Ntahangwa on the water quality of this part of Lake Tanganyika was compared with that of an unpolluted river, the Mugere. A shallow bay, not influenced by a river, was used as a reference station. Chemical analyses were carried out at four week intervals during nearly a year. Samples were taken at different distances from the shore and at different depths. River impact was detected up to 100 m from both river mouths. Even at 50 m from the mouth of the polluted River Ntahangwa, no important decrease of dissolved oxygen was detected. Chlorophyll-a maxima were found 100 m from the Ntahangwa mouth, but this was also the case 100 m from shore in the unpolluted bay. Lake water at 60 m depth was saturated with oxygen during the dry season, as it used to be in 1956. The rivers studied descent initially within the lake due to greater sediment load and lower water temperature. Nevertheless, it appears that these rivers mix completely in the lake within 100–300 m from the river mouths. The direct effects from organic pollution of the Ntahangwa on the lake seem to be rather negligible. Appropriate anti-erosion measures should reduce massive sediment discharge into the lake.","Sources of pollution at the north end of Lake Tanganyika are concentrated around Bujumbura, Burundi.

In the southern end of the lake, the onset of cooler, windier conditions during May-September caused stratification weakening, tilting of isotherms and upwelling of dissolved inorganic nitrogen and soluble reactive phosphorus from nutrient-rich deeper waters. These factors coincided with an increase in chlorophyll- a concentrations but not with clear evidence of increased primary production. An internal seiche at that time seemed associated with similar but less pronounced events at the other stations after cessation of the winds. We suggest that internal seiching can spread kinetic energy throughout the lake, triggering upward nutrient fluxes through mixing elsewhere. The response to water displacements in terms of nutrient supply to the epilimnion seems to be governed by differences in the strength of vertical temperature, and by nutrient and dissolved oxygen gradients. At the most northern station, these gradients were strongest and closest to each other and throughout the year primary production rates, phosphorus and chlorophyll- a concentrations in the euphotic zone appeared generally higher than at the other stations, probably also because of increased nutrient input from the Rusizi River. We emphasise that the intra- and interannual differences between the strength of lake stratification and wind regime are of major importance in determining the extent of upwelling events upwind as well as internal seiching strength and duration. That consequently affects the extent of internal nutrient loading throughout the lake and ultimately plays an important role in the lake trophic status.","These factors coincided with an increase in chlorophyll- a concentrations but not with clear evidence of increased primary production.

This definitely doesn't need your 24 hour response service, but it would be good to know in suitable advance of a planned October trip whether we need to have a delagua kit sent over so we can train up some local technicians.

It appears to be a capped spring, so I would hope that faecal coliform counts are zero, however I have been told that someone tested the water a while ago and found bacteria. I'm still trying to get their test report - as I have been told nothing more than 'bacteria' and that could be completely innocuous, but I'd like to test for faecals anyway.

538,https://borgenproject.org/clean-water-and-proper-sanitation-in-burundi/,Clean Water and Proper Sanitation in Burundi,"Burundi is a small, land-locked country in Africa that is consistently listed as one of the top ten poorest countries in the world. Despite the country’s abundance of natural water resources, such as Lake Tanganyika and the Nile River, there is still a struggle to find clean water and proper sanitation in Burundi. Overpopulation, political unrest and slow economic development have prevented Burundians from accessing basic necessities, such as clean water. As of 2016, there is a very high risk of contracting water-borne diseases, which contributes to high mortality rates.

Small-scale Solutions

In 2017, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) partnered with REGIDESO, Burundi’s water company. This was to supply 56,000 Burundians with clean and easily-accessible drinking water. Six spring-fed tap stands, sourced from the 32 surrounding natural springs, and a water tower has improved water quality. Further, they have reduced the risk of contracting waterborne diseases. It is one such effort from international organizations partnering with Burundi to help over 64 percent of residents. This is how many residents live below the poverty line. Many poor Burundians have difficulty finding clean water, and the ICRC’s water project is one step to alleviating the side effects of poverty.

Other Initiatives

Also addressing the issue of the lack of clean water and proper sanitation in Burundi are organizations and initiatives. The country relies heavily on international nonprofits and United Nations organizations in receiving aid for the water crisis in Burundi, such as through the construction of wells. UNICEF partnered with Beyonce’s charity, BeyGOOD, to solve the ongoing water crisis in Burundi. As of 2018, the partnership has resulted in more than 35 wells. Furthermore, they are set to build 80 more in the future.

Caryl Stern, President and CEO of UNICEF USA notes:

“Addressing the global water crisis is one of the defining challenges of our time, and the children of Burundi are among the most vulnerable.”

Stern referred to the main cause of death of children under the age of five to be waterborne diseases such as schistosomiasis. Many Burundians drink from unsafe sources of water. The undeveloped health care industry makes matters worse, as those with diseases are not treated properly.

In 2019, UNICEF and its partners began a strategic plan to combat the lack of clean water. Additionally, the organization aims to provide food, proper health care, child protection services and education to more than half a million Burundians. They plan to provide clean water for drinking, cooking and personal hygiene to 200,000 residents this year. The humanitarian strategy requires $10 million to alleviate the water crisis in Burundi. In 2018, over 47,000 Burundians were provided water for drinking, cooking and hygiene.

Future Initiatives

The 2015 protests involving President Pierre Nkurunziza forming a military coup has resulted in Burundians across the country still being affected. As a result, more than 100,000 Burundians have fled the country. These protests are ongoing and affect the economy. As a result, the government shut down all the universities, the telephone lines and the Internet. Despite the continued protests, UNICEF, the ICRC and various nonprofits are the foundation to future success in providing access to clean water and proper sanitation in Burundi.

Concilie Gahungere looks at the access to water in Burundi in relation to gender.

====

Mrs Immaculee S. lives in Gikungu Rural location, which falls in the urban Gihosha district. She is 65 and lives alone with no children or domestic help. Even though she lives close to a residential area, she has no access to clean water. Everyday, she takes a 10-litre jerrican, and goes off in search of water. With her jerrican, she begs her neighborhood “bosses” for a little water. With an air of resignation, she describes how her neighbors receive her: “sometimes they open their big gates, and other times they look at us through the gate, without opening it”. She says the administration must look into providing clean water for the poor and the old. “We are old and poor, we neither have the money to pay for water, nor do we have young children to look after us”, she laments.

Mrs. Immaculee is one of many Burundian women without access to clean water. Article 15 of the Protocol to the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights on the Rights of Women in Africa stipulates under the right to food security, that states must ensure women’s access to adequate and safe nutrition. In this regards, it sets in to necessary mechanisms to:

- provide women with access to clean drinking water, sources of domestic fuel, land, and the means of producing nutritious food;

- establish adequate systems of supply and storage to ensure food security.

Mrs Odette Kayitesi is the former minister for environment. In her view, the Burundian woman’s access to clean water is a critical issue that has been debated for a long time and is still not resolved. The access water, Burundian women have to travel long distances. Often, she covers these huge distances to obtain water that is, in the final analysis, not fit for drinking. She is sometimes forced to draw water from streams for all her home needs, including drinking.

Mrs. Kayitesi laments that the lack of water points within easy access has grave hygiene consequences for the family, both in terms of the transmission of disease, and the future of the girl child. Young girls are forced to abandon the education in order to help their mothers seek out water for household use.

In Burundi, some regions have very few water sources or catchment areas. Even where there is water, the difficulty lies in making it easily accessible. This is the case in the North, the East and the North-Eastern regions. On the other hand, the central plateaus, and the Munirwa regions have sufficient water supply.

WATER ISSUES IN THE CITY

Women living in the city are not spared either when it comes to lack of clean drinking water, states Kayitesi. Some women are forced to draw water from the rivers that criss-cross Bujumbura, such as the Ntahangwa and the Rusizi. In Kayitesi’s view, there is a problem of lack of sensitization, because too many women are still underestimate the importance of clean drinking water. Another problem is that many women in poor neighborhoods do not have the resources to obtain clean drinking water. The cost of living on Burundi is very high, and more so for the poor.

WOMEN AND WATER MANAGEMENT

Our sources indicate that based on the available data, the percentage of the population with access to clean drinking water is very low. During the recent African Water Week held in Tunis, it was noted that only a small percentage of the population have access to clean drinking water and that countries have to intensify efforts by increasing drilling for clean water. Governments have been asked to meet new targets in the 2020-2025 period.

Kayitesi calls on citizens to maintain water point, noting that the population still does not take enough responsibility in protecting what already exists in the interests of sustainability.

Solange Habonimana, former chairperson of CAFOB (Collectif des Associations et ONG féminines du Burundi), agrees that Burundian women have inadequate access to water. In cases where women have access, they have no control or decision-making power. If women had decisive control over the resource, she would be better placed to manage its use, especially in agriculture, which is the principal economic activity in Burundi, and is controlled by women.

As a result, everyday things such as access to clean water and sanitation services in Burundi can be a struggle for the people who live there.

Burundi is located in the Great Lakes Region of East Africa and has been called “the Heart of Africa” because of its geographic shape and location. Although landlocked, the country’s freshwater sources are plentiful. Nearly the entire western border of Burundi lies on the shores of Lake Tanganyika, and most of its northern side is bordered by the Kanyaru River. Other bodies of water there include the Malagarasi, Rusize and Ruvubu Rivers; and Cohaha and Rwero Lakes.

A 2010 Water and Sanitation Profile on Burundi from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) reported that their renewable internal freshwater availability was equal to just under 330,000 gallons per person every year. With a number as large as this, how is it possible that access to clean water and sanitation services in Burundi is a struggle?

The Problems Facing Access to Clean Water and Sanitation Services in Burundi

Since 1962, four wars have taken place in Burundi, the results of which have directly impacted their water sector infrastructure. “Burundi’s water supply and sanitation (WSS), sector endured years of destruction brought on by sabotage and neglect during the civil war and its aftermath […] several kilometers of water pipes, connections and 80% of installed meters were destroyed,” according to USAID. This caused many people to use untreated water, which led to waterborne diseases, triggering higher mortality rates.

In 2000, world leaders adopted the U.N. Millennium Declaration along with seven goals, known as the Millennium Development Goals (MDG), which had targets for addressing extreme poverty. Goal number 7, target 10, was to “halve, by 2015, the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe water and basic sanitation.” USAID reported that in 2008, 72% of urban and rural populations in Burundi had access to drinking water, and 46% had access to sanitation services. There was significant improvement seen in the availability of sanitation services, with 1.2 million people gaining access since 1990.

Although Burundi was likely to meet the MDG, targeting sustainable access to drinking water, it was not expected to reach the “water and sanitation services in Burundi” target. However, the Government of Burundi was working to improve their WSS sector by creating new policies to increase coverage throughout the country, according to the USAID. Past and current donors contributing to the WSS sector include the African Development Bank (AfDB), the United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund (UNICEF) and The World Bank.

542,https://www.dandc.eu/en/article/burundi-struggling-various-measures-stop-disappearance-its-water-sources,Burundi is struggling with various measures to stop the disappearance of its water sources,"Burundi meets its water needs from sources in its own country. But these sources are at increasing risk of drying up. Erosion must urgently be stemmed, and afforestation is needed too.

According to the Ministry of Environment, Burundi has over 24,000 water sources. More than 10 % have already dried up, however, and another 17 % are in the process of doing so. Environment Minister Déo Guide Rurema says: “If nothing is done, they will completely dry up as well.” Preserving them is very important. Burundi has very few rivers that might supply drinking water. The White Nile has its source in the country, but carries little water here.

Five out of the country’s 18 provinces are severely affected: Bubanza in the west, Rumonge in the south, Gitega in the centre and Ngozi and Kayanza in the north. Water scarcity is compounded by fast population growth, which results in more land being used for farms as well as buildings. According to Jeremie Nkinahatemba, general director at the Ministry of Environment, some 100,000 tons of soil are being eroded every year.

Burundi’s forests feed most of its water sources, but they too are under threat, not least because people need firewood and building timber. The production of charcoal, which is used primarily for cooking, plays a big role as well. According to Frederick Bangirinama, a professor and environmental activist, the economic metropolis of Bujumbura and the new capital city of Gitega together consume around 70,000 tonnes of charcoal per year. It requires 35,000 hectares of forest to produce that amount. The sad truth is that Burundi’s forests are disappearing fast.

In response, the government has launched a nationwide afforestation project. Over 50 million trees were planted on clear-cut mountains in the past two years. Local people are responsible for protecting these trees and will be punished if they don’t, Nkinahatemba stressed. Other measures include the digging of anti-erosion ditches and the replacement of eucalyptus trees, which require a lot of water, with other varieties.

There are also private initiatives, such as the Kaze Green Economy (KAGE) project founded by Delphin Kaze, an environmental science student at the Polytechnic University of Gitega. For the past two years, the project has been producing coal from corncobs as an alternative to charcoal. The young enterprise sources its raw material from farmers as well as household waste. It is still struggling with transportation challenges, but its goal is to supply Gitega and Bujumbura with “clean coal”.

Filipa Anacoreta, ICRC water and habitat coordinator for Burundi

Why is drinking water a problem in Burundi?

Unlike other countries, Burundi has no lack of water resources. The problem is that they are not being properly managed.

Most of the system dates from the time when Burundi was a Belgian colony and has not been updated since then. Take Rumonge, for instance, a city in the south of the country with a popula tion of 50,000. The water system was designed for 10,000. The infrastructure cannot keep up with demand, so people draw water from the lake. This has already caused a cholera epidemic. In 2006, the ICRC responded by launching a project to increase the production of drinking water in the city.

In addition, the water system is still suffering the consequences of the fighting that racked the country in the 1990s, destroying much of its water infrastructure. A local study has shown that if all of the infrastructure were repaired, 70% of the rural population would have drinking water, whereas at the moment that figure is only 40%.

What are the ICRC’s priorities with regard to WatHab programmes?

When the ICRC returned to Burundi in 1999, security constraints obliged us to stick to the towns. We only restarted work in rural areas in 2004. Most major agencies are focusing on the towns, whereas the needs are greatest in the countryside; 70% of the urban population has access to drinking water, as against just 40% of the rural population. The ICRC decided to devote a large part of its WatHab effort to those parts of the countryside with the least infrastructure.

Our primary objective is for the maximum number of people to have drinking water. In most cases, this involves renovating, upgrading or extending existing networks.

Who are the ICRC’s main partners?

We are working closely with the Regideso (the national water and electricity provider) on all urban projects. In rural areas, our partner is the DGHER (Direction générale de l'hydraulique et des énergies rurales, directorate-general for water and rural energy).

Our partners do not always have the technical capacity to run these projects. One of our roles is therefore to provide training. At the end of this year, personnel from both organizations will be attending a course given by specialists from the International Office for Water (Limoges, France) on the management of pumping stations and generators.

The ICRC is also training local water committees and community water boards and encouraging them to take up their responsibilities. The aim is that they themselves manage and maintain the infrastructure once it has been repaired. This includes collecting fees.

What are the main projects currently under way or scheduled for the near future?

Work in progress at Mabanda

The delegation assessed the water situation in the first half of 2008. This enabled us to prioritize work in accordance with needs, or the degree of commitment on the part of the authorities to manage and maintain the installations.

We have just completed two urban projects, one in Gatumba and the other in Mabanda. Once Regideso has finished its part of the work, these two projects will provide water for 37,000 people.

A rural project providing water for almost 9,000 people was recently completed in Isale, and a project benefiting a population of 10,000 is nearing completion in Rwanzari.

In 2009, we plan to renovate catchments and construct infrastructure around existing springs at four rural sites in the provinces of Cibitoke, Mabanda, Ruyigi and Kirundo. We also intend to renovate an urban catchment in Cibitoke.","And yet too many people are still deprived of drinking water.

The partnership will support programmes to improve water, sanitation and basic hygiene practices in the hardest-to-reach areas of the landlocked East African nation, where nearly half the population has no access to safe water.

“Access to water is a fundamental right,” she said. “When you give children clean and safe water, you don’t just give them life, you give them health, an education, and a brighter future. I am committed to helping drive lasting solutions to the water crisis in Burundi.”

The first phase of the partnership includes the construction of new wells, to avoid children having to walk kilometres searching for wells and missing out on school. The new wells will be equipped with hand pumps, hygiene education and the improvement of water and sanitation facilities in schools in four priority regions, including Bukemba and Giharo in Rutana Province and Kinyinya and Nyabitsinda in Ruyigui Province.

According to UNICEF, children in these rural communities are chronically malnourished and more than 65 percent of the population is using unsafe water sources.

Beyoncé thinks that all people should have access to clean drinking water and through her nonprofit BEYGOOD4BURUNDI, she’s helping to advance that goal in the East African country of Burundi.

On March 22, the fashion brand Gucci committed $1 million to BEYGOOD4BURUNDI through its charity arm Chime for Change, which Beyoncé helped co-found along with Salma Hayek Pinault, according to People. Gucci is also a partner of Global Citizen.

The pledge will allow 80 wells to be built in the country, so that 120,000 people can have better access to clean water, People reports.

And it will help BEYGOOD4BURUNDI get closer to its goal of bringing clean water to 360,000 girls and women in Burundi by 2020.

Formed in 2017, the nonprofit has already constructed 35 wells in the country, according to its website.

The nonprofit works with UNICEF to identify communities most in need, establish relationships with community leaders, and then build infrastructure.

In addition to the wells, the nonprofit builds hand pumps, teaches people about hygiene, and improves sanitation facilities in schools, its website states.

“Access to water is a fundamental right,” Beyoncé said at the time of the nonprofit’s forming.

“When you give children clean and safe water, you don’t just give them life, you give them health, an education, and a brighter future,” she added. “I am committed to helping drive lasting solutions to the water crisis in Burundi.”

Throughout Burundi, only 60% of the population has access to clear drinking water and millions of people have to walk miles to fill containers with water from pits or other water sources and then walk back.

Oftentimes, these water sources are not safe and can lead to waterborne illnesses like diarrhea, according to UNICEF.

More than 50% of Burundi’s population is under the age of 18, and life expectancy in the country is currently 43 years old, one of the lowest levels in the world, largely because illnesses from contaminated water affect so many young people, UNICEF notes.

The burden of collecting the water, meanwhile, often falls on girls and women and changing this dynamic is a main focus of Beyonce’s campaign.

Because girls and women spend so much time getting water, they often miss out on school and other opportunities, which can set them up for early marriage, poverty, domestic violence, and other harms, UNICEF has found.

Globally, 2.1 billion people lack access to clean drinking water, and 800 children under five die every day because of waterborne illnesses, according to UNICEF. Global Citizen campaigns for universal access to clean water and you can take action on this issue here.

Torrential rain that lasted more than 10 hours has caused havoc in and around Burundi’s capital Bujumbura.

69 people, many of them children, have been confirmed dead as flooding, mud and landslides caused by the rain, swept away homes or caused houses to collapse. More than 180 people have suffered broken arms and legs or fractures to the head. More casualties are expected as rescue teams reach all of the affected areas.

So far, nearly 20,000 people have been displaced, and close to 2,200 families have been left homeless. Two bridges were swept away and infrastructure such as roads and power supplies have been damaged. So too have crops and livelihoods.

The Burundi Red Cross Society (BRCS) is urgently appealing for donations to help victims of this disaster, which hit the capital Bujumbura and the five communes of Kamenge, Kinama, Buterere, Ngagara and Kanyosha. Kinyinya and Kijaga in Mutumbuzi commune are also reported to have been affected.

“Today, we call upon all charitable people who have historically shown solidarity with Burundi to again come forward. We need temporary shelter. We need hygiene kits and we need kitchen sets. People are destitute. We absolutely have to find the means to assist these people,” says Pamphile Kantabaze, Secretary General, BRCS.

There is also an urgent need for food and access to proper water and sanitation facilities. Currently, BRCS is providing drinking water in five different temporary sites which the government has set up.

The National Society has mobilized more than 400 volunteers, who together with 60 staff, are involved in the rescue operation, providing first aid, evacuating the seriously injured to hospitals, and searching for missing persons. Others are constructing temporary shelters and digging latrines.

Until now, BRCS has distributed 100 blankets, 100 mosquito nets, 100 plastic mats, in addition to jerry cans and soap. But more is needed.

With a contribution from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), WFP started providing assistance from Monday to families facing acute food shortages in Busoni, Bugabira and Kirundo communes to ensure that they receive nutritious food for at least one month.

“The scale of the damage caused by the drought in Kirundo is shocking. We are acting now to help affected families and prevent the impact of climate change taking a toll on the most vulnerable people,” said Virginia Villar Arribas, WFP Country Director and Representative in Burundi.

Villar Arribas participated last week in an evaluation mission in three communes in Kirundo with the Governor of Kirundo and the Ministry of Agriculture.

The assessment by the National Platform for the Prevention of Risks and Disaster Management in collaboration with UN agencies and national and international Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) found that most households in the three communes lost their harvests due to a shortage of rain in the planting season in late 2018.

Families have no access to food and no opportunities for work. Markets are empty or contain a limited amount of high-priced food. As a result, many families are almost unable to have even one meal a day. Some have left Kirundo to search for goods or work in neighbouring provinces.

The situation is likely to deteriorate further during the lean season in April and May because farmers have lost their harvests and have no seeds for the coming planting season.

“I was personally struck and humbled by the attitude of women on the frontlines doing their best to support their families despite hardship,” said Villar Arribas. Many families reported that they had to sell all their assets including livestock, land and homes, resulting in total destitution.

After the assessment, it was recommended emergency food assistances be given to families. Malnourished children under the age of five and pregnant women and nursing mothers will receive supplementary feeding. Drinking water and agricultural support should also be provided and health services reinforced.

In partnership with the Burundi Red Cross, WFP is distributing more than 1,000 metric tons of food – cereals, beans, iodised salt and vegetable oil to cover one month of needs. This complements government assistance provided in January to food insecure families in Kirundo.

In addition, WFP, working with the Ministry of Education and German NGO Welthungerhilfe are providing daily school meals to over 142,000 children in the province. In partnership with the NGO Concern Worldwide, WFP is also supporting the treatment of moderate acute malnutrition and providing highly nutritious food to prevent stunting at health centres.

To ensure continued assistance for four more months from April, WFP requires US$7 million.

Drought dominated many parts of the Greater Horn of Africa (GHA)* region in 2000. In some places, it was the worst for decades and in others was an extension of the persistent drought that began in 1998.

The upper figure on the graphic summarizes the major climate anomalies that were experienced in the GHA during 2000, while the lower figure shows monthly cumulative rainfall for the mean and two years. It should be noted that many parts of the regions that were under drought stress in 1999-2000 had experienced excessive rainfall and flooding during 1997/1998.

Rainfall during the March-May 2000 period (the long rains season in equatorial eastern Africa) was late and light; in some places, the rains failed completely. This failure was associated with La Niña conditions and cyclone activity in the Indian Ocean. Parts of eastern Ethiopia, northern and south-western Kenya, as well as the north-west of the United Republic of Tanzania, experienced the driest conditions on record since 1961 during the usually peak rainfall month of April.

The June-August period was much wetter, leading to near- or above-normal conditions over much of the northern and western parts of the region. The southern parts of the northern sector, however, continued dry; some parts of southern Ethiopia experienced the driest conditions on record since 1961.

From October to December, there was heavy rainfall in the west, and some parts of eastern Uganda and the southern part of the United Republic of Tanzania had the wettest conditions on record since 1961 for the months of October and December. This spilled over to January 2001, with parts of southern, central and western Kenya, as well as Uganda, experiencing flooding.









January is a dry month over many parts of the GHA. January 2001 was, however, extremely wet; warm areas of water were observed in the Arabian and Mediterranean seas and western Indian Ocean. The Arabian high-pressure ridge weakened considerably, while several tropical cyclones (Ando, Bindo and Charly) developed in the Indian Ocean. These, among other factors, caused the influx of moist westerlies from the Atlantic Ocean and central African region to the equatorial parts of eastern Africa. As a result, unseasonably heavy rainfall pounded parts of central and western Kenya, as well as southern Uganda. Heavy flooding followed in some areas. Heavy rainfall also persisted over much of the United Republic of Tanzania with some western locations recording the wettest conditions for the month since 1961.

For example, areas of Burundi are in need of immediate emergency food and water supplies. Aid agencies, such as ActionAid, are starting to bring in supplies.

Hannah Crabtree, who works for ActionAid, has just returned from touring Burundi. From London, she spoke to English to Africa reporter Joe De Capua about what she saw:

?I went up to the north on the border with Rwanda to a place called Kirundu. It?s a small town?on the border with Rwanda and Tanzania. Now what I saw there was a really horrific situation. Basically, as I drove along the road, it?s four hours out of the capita city, Bujumbura. And you drive along the road and it?s green and lush and you can?t understand why there would be a food crisis. But when I got to Kirundu, I was taken to this hospital that had been transformed into a child-feeding center. And the sights that greeted me there were just shocking?. It was a hospital that was full of children with severe malnutrition, and quite obviously many of these children weren?t going to survive.?

She blames the situation not only on drought, but also on years of conflict and high levels of HIV/AIDS. Crabtree says she visited banana and coffee plantations that had dried up. The men who had lived there had left to search for food, while their families remained and awaited their return. She says people told her that one man became so desperate he tried to hang himself but was cut down by villagers.","The drought that?s gripping East Africa is also affecting parts of Central Africa.

This, along with above-average staple food prices, is increasing the severity of the October to December lean period for poor and very poor households in Eastern Lowlands and Imbo Plains livelihood zones. In these livelihood zones, Stressed (IPC Phase 2) outcomes are expected through the outlook period.

NOAA, USGS, and ICPAC forecast that the October to December short rains will likely be near-average nationally (90-110 percent), with localized areas of slightly below-average rainfall (76-90 percent). The rains typically start in mid-September, but the start was delayed until the end of October this year and so far below-average rainfall has been reported in low altutude areas, particularly the Eastern Lowlands livelihood zone. The late start of the short rains in the third week of October is delaying 2021 Season A sowing by more than one month.

Bujumbura, Burundi - Following the celebration of World Water Day this week, Thursday's press conference of the United Nations Operation in Burundi (ONUB) focused on problems of access to safe drinking water and sanitation. The special guest, Mr. Amadou Diallo, UNICEF-Burundi Water and Environmental Sanitation Specialist, illustrated the urgency of the problem in these words: ""In sub-Saharan Africa, more than 4,000 children die everyday of water-borne diseases, or three children every minute"".

This reality calls for an urgent action on the part of governments from the most affected countries and even from those that are less affected. Thus, the UN General Assembly set out a goal to make it possible for ""every household and every school in the world to have access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation services"" by 2015.

In Burundi, UNICEF is committed to improve access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation and hygiene services in communities, schools and health centres from targeted provinces. While responding to a journalist, Mr. Diallo said that one out of five deaths (20 percent) in Burundi is caused by a water-borne disease or poor sanitation.

General Libère Hicuburundi, Executive Secretary of the National Commission for Demobilization, Reinsertion and Reintegration (CNDRR), intervened in the second half of the press conference, and informed journalists that the demobilization of ex-combatants has been back on course since 17 March 2005 after being suspended for the checking of lists in Buramata. Since then, 247 ex-combatants of the CNDD-Nyangoma at the Kabumburi Assembly Zone (Bururi Province) and 93 ex-combatants of the Kaze-FDD in Buheka (Makamba Province) have moved to the Gitega Demobilization Centre.

General Hicuburundi further said that ONUB, the Joint Ceasefire Commission, the Integrated Joint Chiefs of Staff and representatives of the CNDD-FDD are currently checking the names of some 4,000 candidates waiting to be demobilized at the Buramata site.

At the end of the checking process in the demobilization centres of Randa and Muramvya, the following results were reported: out of 163 women candidates in Muramvya, 109 were identified as combatants while in Randa, 315 men, out of 480 candidates, were accepted. According to General Hicuburundi, the checking process is continuing in Buramata where 400 ex-combatants were transferred, on 18 March 2005, from over a thousand confirmed cases.

Now the fight is on to restore vital facilities, such as water and sanitation. ICRC projects have so far provided safe water to some 100,000 people around the country.

© ICRC / Marco Succi / bi-e-00003

The ICRC drills boreholes, builds pumping stations and storage tanks.

The only tap at the primary school at Gatumba, 10 km north of Burundi’s capital, Bujumbura, has been out of service for years, due to the conflict. Pupils have to bring water from home for cleaning and washing.

For most children and their mothers, fetching water means walking long distances and standing in line at one of the few public taps available. The entire town of Gatumba – with an estimated population of 40,000 - has only one tap that functions around the clock. A few others work in the late evening. The authorities blame the problem on the rapid growth of the population since the outbreak of the conflict in 1993.

"" The town has been suffering from this calamity of a lack of water for a long time "" , explains District Commissioner Prosper Banzamba. "" Before'93 only about 12,000 people live d here. But people fled the conflict from all provinces in Burundi and came here because it was peaceful. That is why we have such a dense population today. ""

Most urban centres in Burundi like Gatumba attracted a large number of displaced people as well as refugees fleeing neighbouring Congo’s civil war. The whole country’s infrastructure, including drinking water and sanitation facilities, virtually collapsed; in 2006, fewer than half the population had direct access to drinking water.

For many families, the only solution is the nearby Ruzizi River, which originates in Rwanda and runs through Burundi to Lake Tanganyika - Africa's longest and the world's second deepest lake, shared with neighbouring Congo RDC, Tanzania and Zambia. However, the water from the lake is as unfit for consumption as the water in the Ruzizi.

But despite the obvious health risks, women use the water for cooking and drinking, even though boiling it does not make it safe. ICRC water engineer Corrado Generelli points out: "" The colour tells you it is absolutely unfit for consumption. There is certainly mud in it but also germs and other agents that are not at all good for human health. ""

Alleluia, the water’s on…

Such is the vital importance of water in the reconstruction of war-torn countries like Burundi, and its impact on public health, the country’s president, Mr Pierre Nkurunziza, travelled down to Rumonge, on the shores of Lake Tanganyika, for the inauguration of the new water distribution system renovated by the ICRC.



And to make the occasion just a little more special, he brought with him not only several ministers and members of parliament, but also his football team, Alleluia Sport.



After a tour of the installations, not forgetting to sample the water himself, the president and his “équipe” faced up to the local ICRC team. A potentially delicate situation was resolved with a score satisfying presidential honour, Red Cross neutrality and diplomatic niceties: one-all.



Not to mention, according to the local chief, human and animal remains…

Gatumba’s only public health centre warns people about the risks of drinking the water from rivers and lakes. Diseases like typhoid, cholera and dysentery are the most common deadly threats – in Burundi, one out of five deaths is caused by water-borne diseases or poor sanitation.

Avoiding epidemics is a major challenge, as even the centre itself does not have running water. Taps don’t work and patients have to bring their own water when admitted to the centre, says nurse Gloriose Bizimana.

The people of Gatumba may soon expect some relief from their desperate plight – the ICRC is rehabilitating the town’s water supply system. This includes drilling two boreholes and building a pumping station and storage tank. Over 20 tap stands will be repaired and a pipeline laid, connecting the town to a large water tank. Soon, it is hoped that everyone in Gatumba will have access to drinkable water.

A similar project in Rumonge, a town of 50,000 people in the southern Bururi province, on the shores of Lake Tanganyika, is already bearing fruit. Here, hardly anybody drinks the lake water any more, and only rarely do women living close by wash their laundry in it. The ICRC renovated the water supply system, providing enough drinking water for the entire population. Since the facilities were inaugurated in October 2006 (see box), after two years’ work, the available drinking water increased tenfold, with 15 taps operating around town.

Burundi’s REGIDESO (the national water board) is responsible for running the sy stem; ICRC will organize training for the staff involved.

Fetching water for the family is no longer a tiresome task, says a resident: "" Before this project, everybody went to the lake to bathe and to fetch drinking water. Rumonge has had constant cholera epidemics since 1978; the population suffered for a long time from a lack of drinking water. For the population of this town it is really a big present, I would say an unforgettable present. ""

The ICRC is carrying out similar projects in other parts of Burundi. In 2006 alone, it ensured access to safe water for over 100,000 people in both towns and villages.

All too often, travellers abruptly find themselves suffering from a gastrointestinal infection. This condition occurs so regularly that it merits its own name: Traveller’s Diarrhea. The culprits are bacteria, protozoa, viruses, and toxins that are transmitted through contaminated food and water, and poor hand hygiene practices.

Food and water-borne illnesses can occur in any country. When we are travelling, we are more likely to be unfamiliar with our food – we won’t always know where it came from, how it was prepared, or who handled it. Some of us are also more inclined to take risks by trying local delicacies and eating from various food vendors. You can prevent gastrointestinal infections when you know the risks, make safe choices, and practice good hygiene. The golden rule is: Boil it, Cook it, Peel it, or Forget it!

Drinking water safety

Always exercise caution with your drinking water. In areas where hygiene and sanitation are challenging to maintain, taking precautions with drinking water is essential.

Is the tap water safe?

Tap water quality and access to clean drinking water varies from region to region. The safety of the drinking water at your destination depends on context-specific factors such as the local supply and distribution system as well as the monitoring and enforcement of water quality standards.

Water quality can be affected by:

Lack of safe water storage

Old pipes or water treatment systems

Poor sanitation infrastructure

Agricultural run-off

Chemical pollutants

Human or animal waste

Weather-related events such as flooding

Even slight changes in water composition can cause Traveller’s Diarrhea. For example, tap water at your destination will have no ill effect on the local population, but due to different treatment standards there may be higher concentrations or unfamiliar strains of E.coli bacteria present. This can cause diarrhea since you do not develop immunity during short-term exposure.

How to prevent water-borne illnesses

Boil your water

If you are unsure about the tap water quality at your destination, bring the water to a rolling boil. Boiling your water destroys pathogens that can cause gastrointestinal infections such as E. coli, Giardia, and Cryptosporidium. Let your water cool in a covered container overnight and pour it into your reusable water bottle before heading out for the day.

Treated water

Water disinfection methods such as filtration, ultraviolet (UV) light and chemical disinfection can be used if there is no heating source to boil water. To learn about different treatment methods, see the following resource:

Bottled water

Bottled water is another option. However, bottles may be outdated or tampered with. Bottled water is also a large contributor to pollution and contributes to the water crisis. If you do purchase bottled water, do so from a reputable source and check that the bottle cap is properly sealed.

Food safety

Always exercise caution when eating high risk foods. Reduce your risk of illness by practicing food safety and following good hand hygiene practices at your destination.

How food becomes contaminated

Exposure to contaminated food is a common source of gastrointestinal illnesses. Before we eat our food, it encounters growers, processors, storage facilities, retailers, and food handlers that can introduce pathogens such as e. coli, Clostridium botulinum, and salmonella. Contamination can also occur through:

Washing food with untreated water

Cross-contamination of raw and cooked items

Improper cooking, storage, and refrigeration

Unsanitary cooking tools and utensils

Poor hand hygiene

How to prevent food-borne illnesses

High risk foods

Due to increased risk of contamination, travellers should practice caution with the following foods:

Undercooked or raw meat, poultry, seafood, fish, and eggs

Unpeeled fruits, vegetables and leafy greens

Unpasteurized dairy products

Foods that have been unrefrigerated or uncovered for a long time such as buffets

Furthermore, it’s not just about what you eat, it’s also important to consider where you eat. It’s not always easy to know if a restaurant or food vendor follows proper food handling and hygienic practices such as properly cleaning cutting boards and utensils, regularly washing their hands, or correctly refrigerating food. Avoid restaurants and food vendors that appear unclean or that don’t have many customers.

Hand hygiene

Hand washing is key to preventing gastrointestinal infections. Inadvertently ingesting fecal matter, protozoa eggs, bacteria or viruses by touching the mouth with dirty or improperly washed hands is a common source of illness. Always ensure that you wash your hands thoroughly before handling food and after using the bathroom.

See the following resources for more information:

Food Allergies

Travelling with a food allergy? Being prepared is important to prevent an allergic reaction or anaphylactic shock during your trip. See the following resources for more information:

Seafood and shellfish poisoning

Marine foods are a common source of food poisoning that can occur in any country due to the availability of these products (fresh or frozen) around the world. See the following resources for more information:

For many years now, the ICRC has been helping to rebuild water distribution networks and giving communities advice on how best to manage their resources. Valery Mbaoh Nana reports on one success story in Bujumbura Rural province.

©ICRC Between 1993 and 2007, Burundi's water production capacity fell by almost half, according to a government survey.

Henri Nininahazwe is a member of the Colline Migera community in Kabezi, Bujumbura Rural province. In 1993, the war in Burundi forced him to seek refuge in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. When he finally decided to return home in 2004, he discovered to his dismay that his village no longer had a drinking water supply. During the conflict, the authorities had not been able to continue maintaining the infrastructure. "" Everything had been damaged during the war, "" he explains.

It was virtually impossible for people to obtain clean water, especially as there were no sources. "" To meet our daily needs, we had to use water from Lake Tanganyika, which is not fit for consumption, "" says Mr Nininahazwe. “We had no way of filtering it. We couldn’t even boil it, because we would have needed firewood for that. We used to walk for miles to find any and the little we had was used first and foremost for cooking. ""

The inhabitants of the region regularly suffered from diarrhoeal diseases. "" During each rainy season, thousands of people would get cholera or dysentery, and some would die as a result. But most people here are illiterate, and they believed that witchcraft was to blame for these deaths. ""

Repairing infrastructure and ensuring it is maintained

In these circumstances, the ICRC decided in 2005 to repair and upgrade the whole region’s water supply system. Work was completed in 2006, and residents once again have access to drinking water in sufficient quantities.

In addition to carrying out the work, the ICRC mobilized residents to ensure that the system would be maintained and would continue to provide water in the long term. Residents received training in repair and maintenance techniques.

As a teacher, Mr Nininahazwe played a major role in these efforts. “The ICRC helped us set up a water management committee, and trained the members. We were also given maintenance equipment.” The committee members were chosen by residents at meetings organized by the community leader, in cooperation with the ICRC.

Four years on, the network is still working well. “The diseases and other problems associated with unsafe water have all disappeared. And, we don’t have to walk long distances any more to collect water. Women have time for other activities that are just as important to the survival of their families, and children can spend more time at school. ""

Henri Nininahazwe is proud of what has been achieved. However, he is afraid that at the current rate of population growth, the network will not be able to serve all the residents for much longer.

Water is a finite resource in Burundi



Burundi is famous for its numerous rivers and water sources. It is therefore often wrongly assumed that the country enjoys a limitless supply of water. However, according to a government survey carried out in 2007, Burundi's water production capacity has almost halved since 1993, owing to the war and other crises that have plagued the country.

Public statistics indicate that the demand for drinking water in towns and cities has tripled in the last 20 years. In rural areas, meanwhile, the demand has jumped from 170 million m3 in 1990 to over 400 million in 2010.

Despite the efforts of parastatal agencies to produce and distribute water – REGIDESO in towns and DGHER in the countryside – the quantities produced remain inadequate. In order to find water, residents of certain towns, usually women and children, must walk long distances, sometimes several times a day, sacrificing time which should be dedicated to income-generating activities or to education. Those without access to drinking water have no option but to take water from rivers and marshes, which is often not fit for consumption.

The ICRC has been supporting REGIDESO and DGHER since 1993 and helping them to run projects to facilitate and improve residents' supply of drinking water. Around one million people are estimated to have benefited from these projects in Burundi since 1999.

“We are obliged to walk long hours up to the hills to fetch drinking water. We do not have time for our income generating activities, we are losing money and poverty is hitting,” he added.

The alternative to walking long distances outside the city to fetch clean water is to buy it from people in the town. People pay between 300 and 500 Burundi francs per jerrican of 20 liters of water.

“Not everybody can afford to pay that money every day,” said Mireille Niyuhire, 17, who was queuing for water. “Some people want to cheat on the water queue, pretending that they are in a hurry. We end up quarrelling and even fighting until they accept to wait like others.”

Some are trying to turn the water shortage into a lucrative small business. Those who ride on bikes or motorcycle can get water quicker and bring more jerricans into the community. But sales are limited – the community does not have the capacity to keep buying water. They are no generating income and many have no money.

Nestor Bikorimana is engaged in the business of selling water. “We buy this water in the hills surrounding the town and we bring the jerricans to sell inside the town. It is good business, but many cannot afford to buy clean water every day”.

Many of the families in Rumonge cannot buy clean water on a daily basis, and instead use and drink untreated water from Lake Tanganyika.

“Many who do not buy from us just drink water from Lake Tanganyika,” said Nestor Bikorimana.

But drinking water from the lake comes with risks. The lake is heavily polluted by the traditional palm oil industry, which dump their untreated wastes in the lake. Untreated waste water from households in the town and other solid wastes are also dumped into the lake.","Emmanuel Ndayishimiye, 23, a resident in the newly created district explains: “It is coming to more than five years, the water supply company does not connect anybody to its water supply system, this puts us in an uncomfortable situation”.

Shortage of safe drinking water in Cibitoke province has been observed in many communes of this western province since early March 2019. They call on the Burundian company in charge of supplying water and electricity- REGIDESO to handle the issue before they catch diseases caused by the lack of clean water.

Anne Nahimana says water shortage has become a big concern in Cibitoke province. “We have to fetch dirty water from the river which we use to cook. And sometimes we are obliged to drink it because we have no other choice,” she says adding that she fears that her children will catch diseases caused by dirty water.

Hélène Ntakironde says even patients at the hospitals suffer the lack of clean water. “There is no water and this also affects hospitalized people. There is an urgent need to provide clean water,” she says.

Pascal, met in Cibitoke province, says they are living in a critical situation because they are obliged to buy water at exorbitant prices. “Bicycle riders go to fetch water in remote areas and we pay BIF 500 per jerry can. This means that a family can spend BIF 5000 per day for water,” he says adding that clean water is not affordable for ordinary citizens.

He calls on REGIDESO to urgently fix the problem before it’s too late as the population may catch cholera or other waterborne diseases.

REGIDESO agents in Cibitoke province say the company is doing its best to supply clean water again.

There has been a remarkable shortage of water in Kanyosha and Kamenge neighborhoods of Bujumbura city since the past few days. People fear the outbreak of some diseases if nothing is done.

In some localities of Bujumbura city, people hardly get clean water. Public and private taps have run dry. Even in some taps where there is water, it is not enough. There are therefore long queues of people waiting for their turn to fetch it.

“In Mirango II, there has been a shortage of water since July 15th. Even when we get it, it is not enough and can’t last longer,” says Frédéric Bujana, a resident of Mirango locality in Kamenge zone of Ntahangwa commune, in the north of Bujumbura.

He says managers of Regideso, a company in charge of distributing water and electricity in Burundi are already aware of this water shortage.

“They promised there would be water supply alternation among localities,” he says adding that since then, nothing has been done to handle this issue.

Mr. Bujana asks Regideso to do all it takes to give them enough water. “These days, we hear from the radio that there are cases of cholera in some neighborhoods of Bujumbura city. We fear that this disease may break out as well in our neighborhood if nothing is done,” he says.

Another resident of Mirango says there has been lack of water at a nearby public tap since the past three days. However, he adds that people are familiar with water shortage especially in the dry season.

“We have a problem of water shortage. Life is difficult without water,” says anonymously a resident of Busoro locality in Kanyosha zone of Muha commune in the south of the Burundian capital.

A week can pass without water or we can get it once a week, he adds.

On the other side of Busoro locality, “water often comes in the night and it is not enough compared to the demand,” says another resident.

“As it is the dry season, there must be shortage of water,” says Malyse Ella Nzobonimpa, Regideso Communication officer adding that there is water rationing among neighborhoods in the Burundian capital.

For her, the enlargement of Bujumbura due to the birth of new residential areas and the theft of Regideso materials are the reasons behind this water shortage.

Ms. Nzobonimpa says water rationing is done in a way that no locality can pass two days without water. She asks people to share water as they get it and not to waste it.

It is not the first time that the shortage of water is reported in Bujumbura city especially in the dry season. Over the past few days, cases of cholera were recorded in some neighborhoods of the city due to the lack of clean water.","SocietyThere has been a remarkable shortage of water in Kanyosha and Kamenge neighborhoods of Bujumbura city since the past few days.

Since the country does not have a permanent source of surface water such as rivers or fresh water lakes, the country must rely on deep underground water tables, fed by rainwater infiltration, where they exist. Since 2009, Djibouti has been negatively affected by drought and its consequences on the rural and urban vulnerable communities. Precipitation levels have dropped to approximately half of the normal quantity, and underground water tables have been drawn down. The scarce rains allow a temporary regeneration of water aquifers, but are clearly insufficient to properly replenish these sources. The drought persists. Many cisterns and shallow wells dry up during the dry season, which lasts from April to September, increasing families’ difficulties to access this vital resource. Drought consequences are enormous. Many herders and rural dwellers have lost their sources of livelihood, and uncountable families have seen their incomes drastically reduced and, as a result, are forced to abandon their homelands and seek refuge in urban centers.

This displacement is accompanied by the disruption of traditional coping strategies and increased vulnerability. Preventable communicable diseases, such as cholera, measles and acute respiratory infections are becoming more frequent. More than 15 per cent of Djibouti’s population practices open defecation, and 78 per cent still lack access to improved toilets. There are significant discrepancies between urban and rural areas: while 70.4 per cent of urban inhabitants have access to sanitation facilities, only 16.4 per cent of the rural population has access to latrines.

USAID’s Water, Sanitation and Health (WASH) project aims to contribute to the reduction of mortality and morbidity of the most vulnerable children and women by increasing access to potable water, sanitation and hygiene and by raising awareness on key basic hygiene practices. The project, implemented by UNICEF, funded a strategy for the participatory management of water points in rural areas. The main strategic axes defined to ensure sustainable and affordable access to improved water are as follows (i) improved governance of water points through the transformation of Community Water Management Committees to Water User Associations to officially recognize their role and responsibilities, (ii) application of payment for water supply services to ensure the continuation of the provision of water, accompanied by specific measures to ensure affordability for the most vulnerable, and (iii) efficiency and proximity of operating and maintenance services to water users. The WASH project has provided training on project management for two international NGOs (Action Contre la Faim and Norwegian Refugee Council) and one local NGO, Association pour le Developpement Intégré de Mabla (ADIM). The latter was also trained on evidence-based planning for hygiene promotion within three communities in Tadjourah and Obock regions. Local actions for awareness raising on key hygiene practices were defined for each community taking into account the respective needs.

In addition to the key hygiene practices, treatment of diarrhea at household level and exclusive breastfeeding topics were also addressed to improve the overall knowledge of care providers at community level. Under USAID’s WASH project, sensitization materials were developed in Somali and Afar to support awareness-raising sessions at the community level. Existing materials used for Participatory Hygiene and Sanitation Transformation (PHAST) methods were updated with additional illustrations on water treatment as this topic emerges as a priority needs from the evidence-based planning for hygiene promotion. On improving access to potable water, USAID rehabilitated a total of 5 boreholes and 5 ring-wells in the Ali-Sabieh, Dikhil, Tadjourah and Obock regions, providing access to over 5,740 persons -- 2,040 of whom gained access to potable water sources for the first time.

Distribution pipes have been replaced and tanks serving as water towers were reinforced. The distribution network was expanded for one of the five water supply systems to cover the needs of additional persons. Furthermore, three existing systems have been rehabilitated and distribution networks expanded with the installation of solar pumping systems in the regions to allow distribution closer to the users and reduce the distance that women and girls need to walk to fetch water. Two other ring-wells in Ali-Sabieh have been rehabilitated for the benefit of populations living close to refugee camps. Priority was given to the rehabilitation of disrupted facilities serving communities with high-population density. USAID’s WASH activities have supported the installation of 40 household toilets covering an estimated 240 people in the Ali-Addeh region. 184 households with 736 persons have benefitted from the installation of shared improved toilets. Household members dug the pits and provided manual labor during the implementation. The operating and maintenance system of these toilets is ensured through an organization established by the beneficiaries themselves and monitored by the implementing partners.","Since the country does not have a permanent source of surface water such as rivers or fresh water lakes, the country must rely on deep underground water tables, fed by rainwater infiltration, where they exist.

The European Union, UNICEF and the Djibouti government provide clean water to thousands of rural residents

© UNICEF Djibouti/2007/Pirrozi

DJIBOUTI, 2 July 2007 – At least 25,000 of the poorest and most vulnerable rural residents will for the first time be able to access clean drinking water close to their homes through a partnership between the European Union (EU), UNICEF and Djibouti’s Ministry of Agriculture. The step will help contribute to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), the quantifiable targets to address issues such as poverty, health and environmental sustainability.

Through the partnership, which was celebrated recently in the capital Djibouti, the EU will provide UNICEF with Euro 2 million towards their water and sanitation programme with the Ministry of Agriculture. UNICEF will provide technical expertise and contribute an additional Euro 60,000, while the Minister of Agriculture will be the main implementing partner.

“The two-year water supply project targeting rural districts is very significant since people living in 45 villages and their 40,000 heads of cattle will have access to clean drinking water,” said the EU Representative in Djibouti, Joaquin Gonzalez. Access to clean drinking water is one of the eight MDGs and has a positive impact on the other development goals, including fighting poverty and lowering child mortality.

“The water supply programme will help to improve the living conditions of many children and women and to the achievement of priority indicators in line with the Millennium Development Goal related to water and sanitation,” said Aloys Kamuragiye, UNICEF Representative in Djibouti.

Globally, an estimated 1.5 million children continue to die every year from diseases associated with lack of access to safe drinking water, inadequate sanitation and poor hygiene.

In the Republic of Djibouti, access to safe drinking water is a daily challenge for the majority of the population living in rural areas. In recent years, a number of experts have underscored the problem of water scarcity and the importance of providing access to life-saving water in this semi-desert country in the horn of Africa.

Most of the available water supply comes primarily from groundwater resources, which are difficult to access and of poor quality. An estimated nearly 50 per cent of people in rural areas do not have access to a protected source of drinking water.

Recurrent drought and a shortage of rain have also had a dramatic impact on the life and well-being of children and their families – with women in particular often walking 30 kilometres a day to get safe drinking water. Limited access to water also constitutes a serious risk in terms of the hygiene and health of women and children.

The EU and UNICEF partnership programme aims to install water facilities and strengthen community participation in maintaining the water infrastructure.

Water is a human necessity. The issue of water quality in the developing world is one that affects millions of people daily. More than half of the population of the developing world suffers from a water-related disease and about 6,000 children die from a water-related disease every day.

Djibouti, a small country off the eastern coast of Africa, is one of these developing countries. Currently, the country is experiencing a major national water crisis. Citizens in rural areas are the most affected: according to UNICEF, nearly 50% of people in rural communities do not have access to a safe water source.

Despite its coastal location, Djibouti is a country heavily affected by drought due to its arid climate. Most of the country’s water supply comes from groundwater resources, which have dwindled dramatically in recent years because of widespread drought.

Water quality in Djibouti is also a national problem. The little groundwater resources that are available are often of poor quality which has resulted in an epidemic of many waterborne illnesses.

The most high-risk water-related diseases in Djibouti are hepatitis A, hepatitis E and typhoid fever. These illnesses are contracted when people come into direct contact with water contaminated by fecal matter. Typhoid fever is the most deadly of the three, with a mortality rate of 20 percent.

Water conditions are slowly improving in the country thanks to efforts made by UNICEF, the European Union and Djibouti’s Ministry of Agriculture. This partnership, which began in 2007, has given more than 25,000 of the poorest people in rural communities access to clean water close to their homes.

The European Union has given UNICEF 2 million euros toward improving water sanitation in Djibouti. UNICEF also agreed to include an additional 60,000 euros to provide technical expertise.

More still needs to be done to improve the water quality in Djibouti. According to the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), about 35% of the rural population has not received any improvements to their water supply.

Luckily, the Djibouti government has shown proactive concern in erasing the national water crisis. With help from UNICEF and the implementation of climate change policy in the country, Djibouti is looking toward a future of increased health and adaptability.

Djibouti, a semi-desert state in the Horn of Africa, experiences frequent drought and most of its water supply is derived from ground water sources, which most poor rural communities have difficulty accessing.

The new project, to be completed in 2008, is funded by the European Union and implemented by the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) and Djibouti's Ministry of Agriculture. It will boost the capacity of the country's 61 diesel-powered pumps, which break down frequently, with 25 new solar-power pumps, according to Ahmedou Ould Sidi, a water and sanitation specialist with UNICEF in Djibouti.

""The advantage of solar compared to thermal energy is that it is much cheaper and requires less maintenance,"" Omar Habib, UNICEF communication specialist.

Communities will be empowered to manage and maintain the water project, Habib said. ""We want the people to participate and to appropriate these pumping stations. The government's role in the long term should be as restricted as possible,"" he added.

The project is expected to benefit the inhabitants of 45 villages and their 40,000 heads of cattle.

""The water supply programme will help to improve the living conditions of many children and women and to the achievement of priority indicators in line with the Millennium Development Goal related to water and sanitation,"" Aloys Kamuragiye, UNICEF Representative in Djibouti, said in a statement.

According to UNICEF's global estimates, 1.5 million children die every year from diseases associated with lack of access to safe drinking water, inadequate sanitation and poor hygiene.

In June, a famine early warning agency reported that pastoralists in inland areas of Djibouti were finding it increasingly difficult to feed themselves as livestock conditions deteriorated because of the delayed onset of the March-May rains.

The March-May short rains in inland Djibouti began six weeks late, and the rainfall in mid-April was poor. The rains normally provide an important respite from the October to February dry season, especially in the northwest and southeast border pastoral livelihood zones, the Famine Early Warning Systems Network said.

Because of the prolonged dry spell, pasture and water availability are below normal, livestock are showing extreme signs of distress and milk production has plummeted to below normal levels.

Results & Achievements

After an initial grant of US$70,000, a program involving the World Bank, the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR), and the Government of Djibouti has leveraged over $40 million in funds for disaster risk management projects.

GFDRR efforts also leveraged the creation of a $5 million national safety net to ease financial stresses caused by disasters.

The GFDRR-funded program installed 5 new hydrometeorological stations in different climatic areas around the country.

The program also catalyzed a $3 million water project to better manage resources in rural areas, along with a $5.2 million power access and energy diversification project.

GFDRR-funded projects have inspired the Djibouti government to pursue preparedness and resilience in cybersecurity, pandemics, and other sectors.

Situated on the Horn of Africa, Djibouti is highly vulnerable to prolonged droughts and flooding. The last major drought claimed nearly 4 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) annually between 2008 and 2011 and impacted more than half of its 860,000 residents.

With funding and guidance from the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR), a vulnerability/risk assessment and communication platform was established comprised of hydrological early warning systems, flood and drought early warning systems, and seismic and floods risk/vulnerability assessment—the first of its kind in Africa.

With nearly 75 percent of its population concentrated in its capital city, Djibouti is at particular risk for water shortages and severe flooding, both of which profoundly impact its growing but fragile economic sector. The 2008-2011 drought caused upwards of $51 million in damages, and more than $157 million in losses. Additionally, given current growth rates, the country’s population is set to double in less than 15 years, increasing strain on Djibouti’s already stressed fresh water resources and its vulnerability to natural hazards (Djibouti’s fresh water availability per capita is only one fifth of neighboring Somalia, Eritrea and Ethiopia), with changes in climate only exacerbating these issues.

Approach

GFDRR and The World Bank have been partnering with the Government of Djibouti since 2007 in an effort to improve resilience and absorb natural shocks to the region’s burgeoning population and economic activity. GFDRR was able to leverage more than $40 million to fund various projects in disaster risk management and recovery, including the establishment of the Middle East and North Africa’s region first comprehensive risk assessment platform to address:

outdated preparedness and emergency plans;

improvements to weather monitoring systems;

needed seismic and flood vulnerability assessments;

inadequate flood and drought early warning systems.

Lessons Learned

Successful disaster risk management requires a multisectoral approach. The Government of Djibouti recognizes that disaster risk management is not a stand-alone activity, but is rather a cross-cutting practice that needs to be mainstreamed through all sectors to ensure sustainable results in development efforts. With trade logistics comprising nearly 85 percentof GDP, the Government has made it a priority to disaster-proof its economy, taking cues from the successful Comprehensive Approach to Risk Assessment in Djibouti (CARAD) project completed in partnership with GFDRR and the World Bank.

A multiplicity of voices can further risk reduction. Because input from both the regional and national level inform disaster management policies and implementation, GFDRR is helping solidify an institutional framework that will streamline communication between governance levels, ensuring that local knowledge is effectively incorporated into national policy.

Next Steps

A proposed third phase of technical assistance spanning 2014-2015 will consist of (1) operationalization of the risk assessment and communication platform that will inform infrastructure investments, (2) detailed spaceborne cartographic mapping of the entire country, and (3) integration of the recently finalized risk/vulnerability assessments for Djibouti-Ville in World Bank urban developments and efforts. Inspired by previous programs. The Government of Djibouti has also reached out to GFDRR to assist in implementing risk management techniques in novel sectors, including cyber-security and public health.","The program also catalyzed a $3 million water project to better manage resources in rural areas, along with a $5.2 million power access and energy diversification project.

573,https://www.voanews.com/africa/djibouti-reeling-several-years-drought,Djibouti Reeling from Several Years of Drought,"GENEVA - The United Nations has launched a two-year, multi-million-dollar appeal to help one-quarter-million people in the tiny East African country of Djibouti recover from several years of persistent, recurring drought. The U.N. seeks $74 million for 2014 to break out of the country’s ongoing cycle of crises.



Two weeks ago, two Somali suicide bombers blew themselves up along with a Turkish man in a café frequented by foreigners in Djibouti’s capital city. The international media devoted little coverage to the story, underlining how overlooked and neglected this tiny country in the Horn of Africa is by the rest of the world.



This is a major problem for nearly one-quarter of Djibouti’s population of 850,000 - some 250,000 people who are seriously affected by more than four years of consecutive drought.



U.N. Resident Coordinator in Djibouti Robert Watkins is in Geneva to get international donors to pay attention to their plight and to support plans to help them emerge from this crisis.



He says malnutrition rates have increased to 18 percent, which exceeds the emergency threshold of 15 percent. In some areas, he says malnutrition is as high as 26 percent and the rate of chronic malnutrition is 30 percent. In addition, he says 60 percent of the rural population is suffering from malaria and diarrheal diseases.



“It is still a very traditional, nomadic population and the livestock has been very dramatically affected by the drought, with stocks continuing to go down,"" he said ""It is a drought deficit that has accumulated over the last four years and it is also resulting in a huge exodus of people living in rural areas to the capital city. The population has almost tripled in the capital city. Now, 85 percent of the population is now living in the capital city.”



Watkins says the city’s facilities are overwhelmed by this huge rural influx as well as by the large numbers of mainly Ethiopian migrants that transit through Djibouti on their way to Yemen. Most of the migrants use Yemen as a portal to reach other countries in the Middle East.



Last year, about 100,000 migrants arrived in Djibouti. Watkins says many of them are in desperate condition and in need of medical care. He says this puts great pressure on the country’s limited medical resources.



Djibouti’s economy grew by five percent last year, but most of the population does not benefit from that growth. The country’s income mainly comes from renting out military bases to the United States and France and from large investments for expanding the ports and building a railroad to Ethiopia.



U.N. Coordinator Watkins tells VOA the two-year strategic plan goes beyond food and health care humanitarian projects. He says it deals with more developmental projects. The aim is to address the root causes so people will be better equipped to tackle the effects of drought.



“The biggest issue facing Djibouti today is the lack of water,"" he said. ""People depend on water for their livelihoods, essentially for their livestock… So, we are doing a lot of projects and so there is less waste of water.”



Nearly half of Djibouti’s population is unemployed. Watkins says the strategic plan will try to address this problem in various ways. For one, the U.N. will try to reconstitute the livestock, which has been lost. But, equally important, he says is to find alternative ways for people to make a living. He says training people in the skills needed to work in the ports is one of the plans being developed.","GENEVA - The United Nations has launched a two-year, multi-million-dollar appeal to help one-quarter-million people in the tiny East African country of Djibouti recover from several years of persistent, recurring drought.

Robert Watkins, U.N. resident coordinator in Djibouti, was meeting officials from donor countries to seek funds for a U.N. appeal of $74 million for Djibouti this year, launched in May. The United Nations has received $9.5 million from donors so far.

“The biggest issue facing Djibouti today is the lack of water. People depend on water for their livelihood, essentially their livestock,” Watkins told a news briefing in Geneva.

Many cattle had perished from the water shortages, he said.

“It’s the reason why we are investing more and more and we trying to find longer-term alternatives for people - not solutions because we can’t solve the drought problem - but we can find solutions for people to find alternative livelihoods,” he said.

A former French colony, tiny Djibouti hosts a French military base and the only U.S. military base in Africa. Its port is used by foreign navies policing the Gulf of Aden’s shipping lanes, some of the busiest in the world, against pirates from Somalia, which borders the country to the south.

Somali militant group al Shabaab claimed an attack on a restaurant in Djibouti by two suicide bombers last month that killed a Turkish national and wounded several Western soldiers.

The country has also become a transit route for some 100,000 African migrants, mainly Ethiopians, heading to Yemen, gateway to the Arabian peninsula and potential jobs in the Middle East.

They too are suffering in the drought.

“Most people are coming by foot. We have been trying to set up rehydration facilities along the road because many people just die on the side of road of dehydration, because there is very little water,” Watkins said.","GENEVA (Reuters) - Djibouti is suffering from a fourth straight year of drought, which has driven a huge exodus of people from rural areas to the capital and caused a surge in disease and malnutrition, the top U.N. official there said on Thursday.

Situation Overview & Humanitarian Needs

Djibouti is a country of 992,637 population with 27,431 refugees (UNHCR database June 2018). One of the main drivers of humanitarian needs in Djibouti is the chronic drought which affects almost 200,000 people in 2018 (FEWSNET 2017), including 20,000 children under the age of five compared to 130,000 people affected in 2016. The impact of drought is aggravated by additional pressures on already overstretched basic social services by asylum seekers (from Somalia, Eritrea, Ethiopia and recently Yemen) and migrants mostly coming from Ethiopia, Somalia and transiting through Djibouti to the Gulf countries via Yemen. The prolonged drought contributes to high prevalence of acute malnutrition, diarrheal diseases and other infectious diseases.

In May 2018, the tropical cyclone Sagar hit Djibouti causing floods in at least 15 per cent of Djibouti city. The cyclone has exacerbated fragile basic social service systems, causing damage to an estimated 10,000 households (about 150,000 people) with about 2,000 households (10,000 people) severely hit. The major concerns among affected populations focused on access to sanitation, given the damage caused to the city’s poorly designed sanitation system, reduced access to safe drinking water for the most disadvantaged families, including migrants, refugees and internally displaced people (in particular from the Damerjog area close to Djibouti City) and increased fragility of poor households in terms of food scarcity and lack of access to hygiene items. The schools and other social infrastructure have been affected with the total damage estimated at USD30 million (as per the World Bank assessment). UNICEF and other aid agencies upon a rapid assessment of the immediate needs of the affected populations, succeeded in mobilizing about $3 million to respond, with $1.296 million to be managed by UNICEF DCO.","• UNICEF and the Red Crescent of Djibouti conducted a large-scale hygiene promotion campaign with more than 25,000 people being reached on handwashing and household water treatment practices through multiple channels (SMS, face-to-face).

• On 21 April, heavy rains triggered widespread flash floods across Djibouti town, affecting many and causing eight fatalities. Additional rainfalls are forecasted throughout the week.

• Hospital Bouffard, where COVID-19 testing facilities are located, was affected, creating disruptions in the operations.

• The Government mobilized to assess the situation and provide support to the population.

SITUATION OVERVIEW

In the night between 20 and 21 April, Djibouti city received 80 mm of rainfall in few hours (half of the annual average), triggering widespread flash floods. Heavy rains also occurred in other areas of the country, causing some damages. In Arta province some 100 mm of rainfall were recorded in the same time span in Damerjog, Chebelley; 110 mm in Iskoutir; and 80mm in PK20. In ali Sabieh province, the capital received 60mm of rainfall, and the refugee village of Ali Addeh 70mm.

Initial estimates indicate that some 18,000 households (approximately 110,000 persons) were somewhat affected across Djibouti city and its suburb of Balbala. At least eight people, including three children and two women lost their lives as their hut – built at the margin of the seasonal river (oued) that separates Djibouti town from Balbala - was washed away by the floodwater.

In Djibouti city, several roads have been inundated and huts were damaged in the Balbala area. The Bouffard hospital, where the COVID-19 testing facility is located, was also flooded, thereby affecting testing operations.

The government immediately mobilized motor pumps and other assets to liberate the main arteries and critical facilities from floodwater.

Social workers from the Ministry of Social Affairs and Solidarity (MASS) were dispatched to assess the situation and identify the most critically affected households. Additional information is being sought.

Whilst the country COVID-19 lockdown continues, many people, especially those living in low areas and prone to flooding, sought refuge in the houses of neighbors and family members. Many have lost their household goods and food.

IOM activated their network and IOM Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM) rapid assessment team engaged with key informants across Djibouti city and Balbala suburb. Many migrants are particularly vulnerable since in many cases their shelters are inappropriate to withstand heavy rains. Interviews indicate that up to 110,000 people (Djiboutian, migrants and refugees) had their houses inundated. The most affected areas include Arhiba (4,000 families), Quartier 7 and Quartier 7bis (2,000 families each), Quartier 6 (1,500 families), Quartier 2 and Quartier 4 and Oued Ambouli (1,000 families each), Einguela and Ambouli (800 families each). All these zones were amongst the most afflicted by the November 2019 floods. In Balbala, some 500 families also suffered losses.

UNHCR tollfree helpline received several requests for support by urban refugees who were most affected by the floods. Initial estimates indicate that some 700 refugee families living in Djibouti city (quartiers 1,2,3,4, Ambouli, Boulaos, Einguela, Arhiba and Balbala) suffered some damages. A team was also dispatched to assess the situation in the refugee villages in the Ali Sabieh province and provide support, in collaboration with authorities.

Against this background, authorities are doing their outmost to continue tracing and testing of COVID19 cases. As of 21 April, the Ministry of Health confirmed 945 cases (99 in the last 24 hours), with 8,955 tests carried out, the highest per capita rate across Africa.","HIGHLIGHTS• On 21 April, heavy rains triggered widespread flash floods across Djibouti town, affecting many and causing eight fatalities.

At least eight people lost their lives, including three children and two women. The victims died after floodwaters swept away their hut, situated at the margin of the river that separates Djibouti town from Balbala.

Several other huts were damaged while roads were submerged. The government promptly mobilized water pumps and other assets to drain floodwaters. Some COVID-19 testing facilities located in the Hospital Bouffard were also hit.

Initial estimates show that around 18 000 households, or approximately 110 000 people, were affected by severe floods.

Authorities from the Ministry of Social Affairs and Solidarity (MASS) were deployed to conduct situation assessment and determine which households are the most critically affected.

UNHCR said they received several requests for help by urban refugees who were suffering from the floods. Initial estimates also added that around 700 refugee families in Djibouti city were impacted. Another crew was dispatched to examine the situation in the refugee villages in the Ali Sabieh province.

The city recorded 80 mm (3 inches) of rain in just a few hours, which is more than six months' worth of its average rainfall. The average rainfall in a year is 127 mm (5 inches).

Light to moderate rain with isolated thunderstorms is forecast across Djibouti city and other provinces in the southern region.

Several other countries in East Africa were also battered by heavy rains over the past week. On April 17, mudslides killed six people in Rwanda, while about 27 000 people in neighboring Burundi had to deal with the aftermath of heavy rains.

In Kenya, at least 4 000 were displaced and fatalities were also reported due to landslides. On April 20, at least 36 casualties were reported in the Democratic Republic of Congo following days of intense rains, which caused major damage and destruction in parts of the country.

Advice

Individuals present in affected areas are advised to keep abreast of the situation, avoid areas directly hit by flooding, and adhere to any orders issued by the local authorities or their home governments. Remember that driving or walking through running water can be dangerous and that floodwater may contain wastewater or chemical products; all items having come into contact with the water should be disinfected and all foodstuffs discarded. Be aware that the risk of contracting water- and mosquito-borne diseases tends to rise after periods of heavy rains; take measures to protect yourself from mosquito bites (e.g. use insect repellent, mosquito nets, etc.) and only consume purified water.

• Testing capacity is available, a quarantine site has been established and two more are under preparation. A care center for severe cases has been set up in Arta, 40 km from the capital.

Additional support is required to bring to scale preparedness and response capacity.

• Since 23 March the authorities imposed a general lockdown in the country, except for essential services. Traffic has been restricted to minimum, and only allowed with administrative authorization. It has now been extended to 16 April.

• All passenger movement (aircraft/railway/boat) continue to be suspended since 18 March. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs restricted military and humanitarian flights with personnel. Civil and military cargo movements continue.

SITUATION OVERVIEW

As of 9 April 2020, the Ministry of Health has confirmed 140 cases of COVID-19 in Djibouti (one already returned to his native country), as well as the first fatality of COVID-19 in Djibouti. In the Balbala suburb of Djibouti town, Al Rahma hospital became a new cluster on 5 April. The facility has been put in quarantine since by the Ministry of Health (MOH).

On 4 April the United Nations in Djibouti confirmed the first case of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) among its staff. The colleague entered Djibouti on March 16 with no symptoms, and prior to arrival in country, was confined in full quarantine. The staff is currently isolated in a designated public hospital and did not come into contact with any aid or assistance recipients. All contacts have been traced and were tested negative. The United Nations in Djibouti is closely monitoring the COVID-19 situation and has previously put in place significant restrictions to reduce the risks of transmission, ensure a safe environment, and protect the health and safety of the community.

In order to limit the risks of contamination, UN staff in Djibouti staff is still largely working remotely is being kept informed through weekly virtual townhalls. Only critical staff are required at the office.

The African Union NEPAD launched its COVID-19 multidimensional plan to mobilize the institution's human capacity and necessary expertise to improve coverage and access to sustainable and resilient health services, while ensuring the protection of Africa's economic foundations.

IGAD contributed USD 700,000 towards the regional fight against the Corona Pandemic. A handover of USD 100,000 has been made to Djibouti, Somalia and Uganda on 6 April.

The UN Secretary-General (SG) remains deeply concerned that the coronavirus continues to spread at an alarming rate, including into countries where millions of people cannot easily access clean water, food, healthcare and shelter. Given the potentially devastating impact on some of the world’s most vulnerable countries, the UNSG stressed the need for a concerted, coordinated global response that encompasses communities such as refugees, migrants, stateless people, those who are internally displaced and others who may be on the margins. The UNSG urged national authorities to work closely with the UN system, under the UN Resident Coordinators leadership to enable the provision of humanitarian assistance by the United Nations and by national and international non-governmental organizations. In a reference to his repeated appeals for a ceasefire in conflicts around the world, to focus on the shared struggle to overcome the virus, the Secretary-General pointed out that violence is not confined to the battlefield, and that “for many women and girls, the threat looms largest where they should be safest: in their own homes”.","SITUATION OVERVIEWAs of 9 April 2020, the Ministry of Health has confirmed 140 cases of COVID-19 in Djibouti (one already returned to his native country), as well as the first fatality of COVID-19 in Djibouti.

582,https://borgenproject.org/a-rising-tide-infrastructure-in-djibouti/,A Rising Tide: Improvements on Infrastructure in Djibouti,"Chinese investment is driving a boom in infrastructure in Djibouti, but gaps still remain when it comes to providing essential services to the country’s most at-risk inhabitants.

Chinese investments promise to revitalize and expand shipping and transportation infrastructure in Djibouti, turning the small African nation of roughly a million people into a major trans-shipment hub on the Gulf of Aden. Chinese-backed projects include an electric train route to Ethiopia’s capital city and developing port facilities in the Port of Doraleh. Djibouti will also host China’s first overseas military base.

Despite these investments and the rapid growth of the nation’s economy over the past 20 years, some people are still left behind, citizens and refugees alike. Djibouti hosts more than 27,000 refugees from across the region, including those fleeing conflict in Ethiopia and Yemen. These refugees typically live in crowded camps with poor sanitation and little access to clean water.

Many citizens of Djibouti also lack reliable sanitation and access to water, particularly in rural areas. Nearly a quarter of the population still lives in extreme poverty, and 48 percent of working-age people are unemployed. The African Economic Outlook estimates that infrastructure development and economic changes driven by foreign investment may trickle down to impoverished citizens in the form of new jobs.

The international community beyond China has also taken an interest in infrastructure in Djibouti. While China’s interests chiefly lie in economic development, others are looking to more humanitarian issues such as education and food security. For example, the United Nations has been working through UNESCO on projects designed to bolster access to water, sanitation and education for both disadvantaged citizens and refugees. Their efforts have reached thousands, but thousands more continue to struggle every day.

The United States is on the ground in Djibouti as well, with the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) working with many partners on multiple projects. USAID is active in improving access to education and its quality. USAID is also working with private and governmental partners to address the transmission of diseases such as tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS along the developing Ethiopia/Djibouti transportation corridor.

However, as NPR reports, USAID funding is insecure under the current administration. The current budget proposal offered by President Trump’s administration would cut USAID and related programs by $2.2 billion. According to the New York Times, savings from these cuts will go to fund further investment in the military and domestic infrastructure. This move by the administration is unlikely to go unopposed. Doubts have already surfaced as to whether Congress will get on board with the administration’s proposals. Following a deal with Democrats, the administration’s budget isn’t likely to come up again for consideration until mid-December.

The government of Djibouti has its own ambitious plan to leverage infrastructure development in the mid- to long-term to raise the nation to “developing” status by 2035. In conjunction with humanitarian aid from abroad, this plan may see the fortunes of all Djiboutians rise like the expected ships at dock in the country’s expanding ports at high tide.

As a result, WASH interventions include latrine construction, provision of safe drinking water, and hygiene promotion—commonly focused upon improved hand-washing, water collection and storage, and sanitation practices. In Fiscal Year (FY) 2011, USAID/OFDA provided nearly $130 million for WASH programs in 28 countries. USAID/OFDA also links emergency activities with transition and development programs funded by other offices in USAID and incorporates institutional partners, such as local governments, in program planning and implementation to promote sustainability. The following are selections of recent USAID/OFDA-funded projects.

Responding to WASH Needs in the Horn of Africa

As of October 2011, the Horn of Africa was experiencing its worst drought in 60 years, with more than 13.3 million people in urgent need of humanitarian assistance in Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya, and Somalia. Decreased water availability had negatively impacted health and nutrition conditions among drought-affected populations and adversely affected livestock health and food security. Affected individuals with high levels of acute malnutrition were particularly vulnerable to the health consequences of poor water and sanitation conditions due to their compromised immunity.

In FY 2011, USAID/OFDA provided nearly $20 million for WASH programs in the Horn of Africa, including rehabilitation and construction of water infrastructure to increase vulnerable communities’ access to safe water for human and livestock consumption. To improve the quality of available water, USAID/OFDA supported WASH interventions such as water chlorination, water quality testing, and distribution of point-of-use water treatment supplies. In addition, USAID/OFDA, through partners, carried out hygiene promotion activities and pre-positioned cholera treatment supplies, particularly in high-risk areas of Somalia. Given ongoing instability in the Horn of Africa, USAID/OFDA also supported training on the management of shared water resources to help ensure more equitable access to water and reduce conflict.

As an example of WASH interventions in FY 2011, USAID/OFDA provided nearly $3.2 million to an implementing partner to improve access to safe drinking water for more than 365,000 drought- and flood-affected people throughout Ethiopia. USAID/OFDA also maintains a WASH rapid response mechanism through an implementing partner that enables ongoing activities to quickly expand throughout Ethiopia in the event of a large-scale emergency such as the current drought. The program provides disaster-affected communities with access to safe drinking water, sanitation and hygiene promotion, well rehabilitation, water trucking, and community-based water supply transportation. The flexible nature of USAID/OFDA rapid response programs in Ethiopia has helped meet escalating needs during the current drought.

WASH Interventions in Pakistan

In July and August 2010, monsoon rains and subsequent flooding throughout Pakistan affected more than 18 million people in 82 of Pakistan’s 122 districts. With floodwaters damaging and contaminating existing water sources and infrastructure, the most pressing needs included safe drinking water and other disease transmission prevention measures. Through funding of relief agency partners and provision of relief commodities, USAID/OFDA supplied 134,335 families with two 10-liter water containers each, provided up to 2 million people a day with drinking water, and distributed 25,000 bars of soap daily to prevent the spread of waterborne diseases among flood-affected populations. USAID/OFDA also provided grants to local non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to deliver emergency relief supplies, promote good hygiene, and increase access to safe drinking water. In addition, USAID/OFDA-funded NGOs utilized cash-for-work programs to rehabilitate water sources and infrastructure in flood-affected areas.

Hygiene Promotion and Commodity Delivery to Help Stem Cholera in Haiti

As of September 2011, the Government of Haiti reported that the cholera outbreak that began in Haiti in October 2010 had resulted in nearly 460,000 cases, more than 240,000 hospitalizations, and nearly 6,500 deaths across all regions of the country. In FY 2011, USAID/OFDA provided more than $40 million to prevent cholera cases, reduce the number of cases requiring hospitalization, and reduce the case fatality rate. USAID/OFDA’s response strategy included provision of chlorine to increase availability of safe drinking water; hygiene promotion and cholera prevention education; provision of emergency WASH and medical supplies, including sachets of oral rehydration salts (ORS); and medical treatment.

Of the total, USAID/OFDA provided nearly $7 million for WASH interventions to mitigate the spread of cholera. USAID/OFDA partners trained networks of 10,000 community health workers and hygiene promoters to provide cholera-related hygiene education and distribute soap and water purification supplies throughout Haiti. USAID/OFDA also funded sanitation activities, such as waste management, hand-washing stations, and disinfection of contaminated households to limit the spread of cholera. The cholera outbreak started in an area not affected by the January 2010 earthquake and was unaffiliated with the earthquake. Ongoing USAID/OFDA earthquake response programs continued to provide WASH services in earthquake-affected areas and displacement camps, primarily in the metropolitan Port-au-Prince area, to reduce the impact of the cholera outbreak.

At the height of the response, more than a dozen USAID/OFDA partners were conducting hygiene promotion and cholera prevention education activities throughout Haiti that reached an estimated 98,000 people each day. Sessions drew large crowds and included demonstrations of proper hand-washing technique, demonstrations of home preparation of ORS (with salt, sugar, and lime), and activities for children, including hand-washing practice and learning of songs to help children remember the different steps of successful cholera prevention. At sessions, USAID/OFDA partners also distributed ORS, water purification tablets, and containers for safe water storage. USAID/OFDA partners also chlorinated public water supplies and trained community decontamination teams. USAID/OFDA partners reported that ongoing, persistent WASH interventions helped local populations improve hygiene and sanitation habits, improve cholera awareness, and lower the rate of new cholera cases.

USAID/OFDA’s hygiene promotion and sanitation interventions complemented USAID/OFDA funding for medical treatment—including establishment and operation of cholera treatment facilities (CTFs) and oral rehydration points—and for procurement and delivery of WASH supplies. In total, USAID/OFDA procured and transported 15 million water purification tablets, sufficient to provide purified water to 750,000 people for one month; 30 metric tons of calcium-hypochlorite (concentrated powder chlorine) for water purification and disinfection of homes, latrines, and CTFs; 5.3 million ORS sachets; 5 million 200-gram bars of soap; 33,180 hygiene kits with supplies for nearly 166,000 individuals; 30,000 ten-liter containers for safe transport of water from distribution points; and personal protective equipment and disinfection supplies for CTF personnel. USAID/OFDA provided more than $18.4 million for procurement and transportation of cholera-related relief commodities for Haiti in FY 2011.","To improve the quality of available water, USAID/OFDA supported WASH interventions such as water chlorination, water quality testing, and distribution of point-of-use water treatment supplies.

Djibouti’s recent investment boom in infrastructure has the potential to transform the economy into a regional hub for East Africa, creating more jobs and helping the country return to a sustainable level of debt, says the IMF in its latest assessment of the economy.

""The authorities should advance rapidly with critical reforms aimed at translating investment into strong, inclusive, and job-creating growth,"" says the IMF’s mission chief for Djibouti Eric Mottu.

The small state in the arid Horn of Africa, neighboring land-locked Ethiopia, largely depends on its deep-water harbor. The country is expanding its transportation and utilities infrastructure to leverage its strategic location as a transshipment hub and host to military bases.

However, the advantages of the strategic location have not been exploited in full. Growth in the past has been uneven and insufficient to lift the population from poverty and provide sufficient jobs. As a result, about 41 percent of the population is poor, 23 percent live in extreme poverty, and the unemployment rate is 39 percent.

Fast Facts Population: 999,300 (2016 est.)

Capital: Djibouti city

Currency: djiboutian franc

GDP per capita: $1,908 (2016 EST.)

unemployment rate: 39% (2015)

































Betting on investment

To address these challenges, the authorities’ development strategy Vision Djibouti 2035 aims at transforming the country into a logistics and commercial hub for East Africa. The strategy includes large-scale investments focused on public sector projects—such as the construction of a railroad to Ethiopia and a water pipeline—and targets a medium-term growth of 7.5–10 percent per year, tripling per capita income, and reducing unemployment. Chinese investors finance many of these projects.

Early results of these investments are encouraging. Growth is estimated to have reached 6.5 percent in 2016, driven by public sector investments. For 2017–19, growth is projected to increase to 7 percent supported by the railroad, the multipurpose port, and other public investment, which should stimulate private sector activity and foreign direct investment.

Debt buildup

Despite more growth, the country is now at a high risk of debt distress as most of these infrastructure investments have been financed externally—pushing external debt from 50 to 85 percent of GDP in just two years.

Rising debt service obligations not only present considerable fiscal risks—the 2016 government budget deficit, including spending on the water pipeline and the railroad, reached about 16 percent of GDP—but could also hamper priority social spending.

Focus on reforms

Therefore, to reap the benefits from these massive investments and ensure that they are shared by all, the authorities will need to focus on several key reforms, aimed at translating the investment boom into strong,inclusive growth to reduce poverty, create jobs, and return debt to a sustainable path.

Debt strategy: Develop a coordinated debt strategy aimed at establishing debt sustainability, given the high risk of debt distress; adopt a public debt law and set an explicit debt anchor, such as public debt-to-GDP ratio.

Fiscal policy: Continue reforming the tax system based on the recommendations of the 2015 National Tax Conference; launch a comprehensive review of tax expenditures, exemptions, and special tax regimes with a view to phasing them out.

Structural reforms: Focus on reforming public enterprises to enhance their efficiency, strengthen governance, and improve their capacity to manage investment projects; pursue reforms to improve the business climate and strengthen competition.

Financial sector: Focus monetary and financial policies on the stability of the banking system, financial inclusion, and external stability.","For Djibouti, Infrastructure Investment Paves Way to Regional HubDjibouti’s recent investment boom in infrastructure has the potential to transform the economy into a regional hub for East Africa, creating more jobs and helping the country return to a sustainable level of debt, says the IMF in its latest assessment of the economy.

The IFAD Soil and Water Management Program (PROGRES) will operate in the regions of Arta, Dikhil and Tadjourah and will cover a total of 13 rangelands, benefiting approximately 66,000 people.

""The project aims to contribute to sustainably improving living conditions and reducing poverty among rural communities and nomadic populations,” said Naoufel Telahigue, IFAD country program manager for Djibouti. “The beneficiaries will be all households having their base camps in localities within these rangelands and living under extremely precarious and climate-vulnerable conditions.”

The total cost of the project over a seven-year period is $17.05 million, including a $5.77 million IFAD loan and a $0.3 million grant. The project is being co-financed by the World Food Programme ($1.7 million), the government of Djibouti ($2.52 million) and by the beneficiaries themselves ($0.7 million). There is still a financing gap of $6.1 million.

The financial agreement was signed in Rome by IFAD President Kanayo F. Nwanze and Djibouti’s ambassador to France, Ayeid Mousseid Yahya.

Rural areas occupy most of the country’s territory and are home to 29% of the population, 67% of whom are nomadic herders. Djibouti is among the world's 10 most water-poor countries and among the 20 countries most affected by water shortages. Because of water and soil scarcity and the country’s semi-arid climate, the agriculture sector is poorly developed and crop production is minimal. Tackling the problem of water shortage is a high priority in the government’s strategy to reduce poverty and vulnerability.

The program will intensify, consolidate and complement interventions and investments from IFAD's previous program for the Mobilization of Surface Water and Sustainable Land Management by expanding existing rangelands or opening new ones. This approach aims to improve surface water collection structures and pasture restoration and regeneration.

Since 1980, IFAD has financed seven rural development programs and projects in Djibouti for a total amount of $54.4 million, with an IFAD investment of $30.1 million, directly benefiting 41,850 rural households.","The International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) and the government of Djibouti signed a financial agreement to address the impact of water scarcity in rural areas of the country.

The step will help contribute to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), the quantifiable targets to address issues such as poverty, health and environmental sustainability.

Through the partnership, which was celebrated recently in the capital Djibouti, the EU will provide UNICEF with Euro 2 million towards their water and sanitation programme with the Ministry of Agriculture. UNICEF will provide technical expertise and contribute an additional Euro 60,000, while the Minister of Agriculture will be the main implementing partner.

""The two-year water supply project targeting rural districts is very significant since people living in 45 villages and their 40,000 heads of cattle will have access to clean drinking water,"" said the EU Representative in Djibouti, Joaquin Gonzalez. Access to clean drinking water is one of the eight MDGs and has a positive impact on the other development goals, including fighting poverty and lowering child mortality.

""The water supply programme will help to improve the living conditions of many children and women and to the achievement of priority indicators in line with the Millennium Development Goal related to water and sanitation,"" said Aloys Kamuragiye, UNICEF Representative in Djibouti.

Globally, an estimated 1.5 million children continue to die every year from diseases associated with lack of access to safe drinking water, inadequate sanitation and poor hygiene.

In the Republic of Djibouti, access to safe drinking water is a daily challenge for the majority of the population living in rural areas. In recent years, a number of experts have underscored the problem of water scarcity and the importance of providing access to life-saving water in this semi-desert country in the horn of Africa.

Most of the available water supply comes primarily from groundwater resources, which are difficult to access and of poor quality. An estimated nearly 50 per cent of people in rural areas do not have access to a protected source of drinking water.

Recurrent drought and a shortage of rain have also had a dramatic impact on the life and well-being of children and their families - with women in particular often walking 30 kilometres a day to get safe drinking water. Limited access to water also constitutes a serious risk in terms of the hygiene and health of women and children.

The EU and UNICEF partnership programme aims to install water facilities and strengthen community participation in maintaining the water infrastructure.

About UNICEF

UNICEF is on the ground in over 150 countries and territories to help children survive and thrive, from early childhood through adolescence.

588,https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/waste/will-africa-meet-its-sanitation-target--61423,Will Africa meet its sanitation target?,"African countries, although serious about safe and total sanitation, are likely to miss Sustainable Development Goals by 2030

Djibouti has Africa’s worst sanitation coverage in rural areas; and reported a shocking 17 per cent increase in open defecation during 2000-2015. One in every four persons goes out to defecate; in rural areas, three in four defecate in the open.

But nobody talks about it. The decade-long spell of drought overwhelms discussions on sanitation. For the world outside, the tiny country is talked about for an entirely different reason—3.3 per cent of the country’s population are refugees, from the Yemen war. So the discussions mostly hover around the humanitarian crisis involving migration.



However, the world is discovering the impact of the lack of access to safe sanitation on the humanitarian crisis brewing in the country. Djibouti is facing a health emergency as water-borne diseases have afflicted the entire population, especially children and women. Most of the waterbodies are now contaminated with faecal remains. And this poses a double whammy for the country which is grappling with severe drought for nearly a decade.



As such, Djibouti gets just 200 mm rainfall a year. Only 0.01 per cent of its land is arable. Most of the country’s water sources are either dry or hardly carry any water. According to the United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund (UNICEF), the limited water supply and stretched services have left nearly 100,000 drought-affected people, living along migration routes, with no access to safe water, and obviously sanitation. The constant flow of refugees in an already safe sanitation-deficit country has made the situation unmanageable.



Djibouti’s capital—also called Djibouti—is home to half of the country’s population. It is only here that one can see the presence of household toilets. But a booming population is making the situation worse. With three-fourths of Djibouti’s population living below the poverty line and more than 50 per cent of rural population food insecure, urban settlements like the capital city are witnessing a deluge of migration of rural inhabitants due to drought. This has increased the demand for basic necessities like water and sanitation. For example, Djibouti city dwellers may have the luxury of having toilets in the houses, but access to sanitation services is still underdeveloped, particularly in the densely-populated southern suburb of Balbala.



Urban areas are finding it difficult to manage wastewater. “Until March 2014, wastewater collected in Djibouti was discharged into the sea without treatment. A sewage treatment plant was commissioned with funding from the European Union (EU),’’ says Radwan Abdillahi Bahdon, Djibouti’s Director of Sanitation. But such initiatives are a drop in the ocean.



The government has been trying to provide financial as well as technical assistance to residents for building mostly primitive and unsafe drop hole toilets. But it is unable to cope with the demand. Djibouti shares a long porous border with Somalia and Ethiopia. There is constant movement of both people and livestock, especially during the lean season (June-September) when nomadic communities often migrate from neighbouring countries to Djibouti in search of pastures for their livestock. Such displaced populations add to the pressure on the already precarious livelihoods in these areas and this is further aggravating food insecurity, as well as overburdening the fragile service delivery systems for nutrition, water and sanitation, health, child protection and education.

Moreover, the rise of acute watery diarrhoea and cholera outbreaks in neighbouring countries has exposed Djibouti to a high risk of epidemics in view of its fragile health systems—low rate of access to safe water and improved sanitation and limited knowledge of key hygiene practices. It is expected the country may well miss its Sustainable Development Goal targets on safe sanitation practices.



But other African countries, with relative advantages, are also finding it difficult to meet this basic target.





NEW BEGINNINGS



Take Nigeria for instance, a relatively prosperous country. Unlike Djibouti, Nigeria has reduced open defecation by 6 per cent during 2000-15. Still about 24 per cent of its population defecates in the open, making Nigeria third-worst in the world in terms of open defecation, after India and China. Notwithstanding this progress, the country typifies Africa’s big challenge: shifting from basic toilets to improved sanitation services. Only 36 per cent of Nigeria’s population has access to improved sanitation.



For the hard-earned economic progress, this is bad news. The World Bank estimates that poor sanitation costs Nigeria US $3 billion annually, or 1.3 per cent of the country’s GDP. The country already attributes the annual deaths of 124,000 children under the age of five to outbreaks of diseases like diarrhoea and cholera linked to lack of sanitation. For 2018, Nigeria has budgeted US $2.7 million for health emergencies and contagious diseases. It also budgeted US $5.5 million for expansion of water, sanitation and hygiene facilities. An Abuja-based independent environment expert, Ayuba Danasabe Umar, says, “Adequate public toilet facilities would rid the country of faecal contaminants that cause enteric diseases and gastroenteritis.”



In 2014, Nigeria took the first steps to be open defecation-free by 2025. But with a change in strategy: involving communities to ensure quality. The National Council on Water Resources (NCWR) partnered with UNICEF to roll out the strategy.



Federal ministries—health, water reso urces, environment, education, housing and urban development and women affairs—converged their activities to attain the target. Alhaji Sidi Abbas, executive director of Sokoto State Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Agency (RUWASSA), says initially Tangaza local government area of Sokoto state was selected for the project. Its success through community-led total sanitation (CLTS) campaigns has prompted the government to expand the strategy to 23 areas in the state.



CELEBRATED WITH CAUTION



As they say, there is no one solution to a crisis that criss-crosses a continent. Ethiopia is an example of winning with a warning. It recorded the highest global reduction rate in open defecation—based on proportion to population. Haimanot Assefa, a rural water supply specialist with UNICEF-Ethiopia, says the country has shown a 53 per cent reduction in open defecation: from 80 per cent in 2000 to 27 per cent in 2015.



Ethiopia is an example of scaling up CLTS along with a much-needed change in strategy—making it a part of the health policy. The country has been successfully implementing its unique Health Extension Programme (HEP) under which water, health and sanitation issues are approached as inter-related concerns. The impressive reduction in open defecation coincided with a similar increase in water supply access coverage, which increased from 14 per cent in 2000 to 82 per cent in 2016 in rural areas.



But this does not mean improved quality of sanitation. The National Hygiene and Environmental Health Strategy confirms that improved toilet coverage in the last 25 years is only 28 per cent. Citing a recent study, Assefa, says that over 90 per cent of urban residents use an on-site sanitation facility, of which nearly 80 per cent are dry pit latrines. He says with less than 3 per cent people having access to a sewer connection, wastewater is continuing to contaminate waterbodies.





Ayantu Taffa, a resident of Kebelein of the Oromia Regional State, says, “Our family has a pit toilet access and a dug well. However, there is no way we can ensure the safety of water.” She adds that her children often suffer from diarrhoea and cannot attend school due to water-borne diseases. Ethiopia is the worst trachoma affected country in the world, with women as well as children aged 1-9 at the highest risk of infection, according to Abireham Misganaw, a public health expert and a member of the Waste Management Team of the Ethiopian Ministry of Health. He cites a national survey stating that the prevalence of active trachoma for children in the age group 1-9 is 40 per cent because of lack of improved access to water and sanitation.



The Ethiopian National Hygiene and Environmental Health Strategy says: “Poor sanitation costs Ethiopia 2.1 per cent of the national GDP. Yet, eliminating the bad practice would require only 6 million improved latrines to be built and used.”



Dagnew Tadesse, director with the Hygiene and Environmental Health (HEH), Directorate of the Ministry of Health, says, “Ethiopia should now turn its face to ensuring improved quality sanitation and water supply schemes.”



TEST OF IMPROVED SANITATION



In Tanzania too people are not reaping the health gains expected through improved levels of sanitation. The case of Mashabani, a 34-year-old resident of Magodani village in Temeke district of Dar es Salaam region, is a testament to this challenge. Mashabani thought that owning a toilet would rid her family of water-borne diseases. “But I and my six children continue to suffer. I spend US $15 every month from our total earning of US $90 on treating water-borne diseases,” she says. She has an open pit toilet. For close to three months, it remains flooded due to rains. “My waste gets mixed up with other water sources and the result is that we consume contaminated water.”



Abdara Juma, the chairperson of the village, says, “We have toilets, but they are of bad quality.” Since August 2015, the country reported 31,291 cholera cases with a death toll of 522. Given the low income of Tanzanians, residents can only afford such basic toilets that costs up to US $44. “Since most residents share toilets, without clean water supply, the women suffer from urinary tract diseases,” says Muamma Muskin, a mother of five children, who herself suffers from an urinary tract infection.



However, Anyitike Mwakitalima, coordinator of the National Sanitation Campaign, a non-profit, says sanitation is not the primary reason for cholera outbreaks; the Ministry of Water has failed to supply clean water to all the regions.



Ali Nyanga, who is with the Ministry of Health Community Development, Gender, Elderly and Children, argues that water supply and sanitation cannot be addressed in a standalone manner, both needs to be safe and sustainable for a healthy country.



Tanzania aims to provide a basic toilet to every household by 2021, says Rowland Titus, who works with UNICEF-Tanzania. In December, 2017 Vice President Samia Suluhu launched a campaign called “Nyumbu Ni Choo” (a house without a toilet is not a house at all). But both UNICEF and the World Bank, who are working with the government on sanitation issues, think it is an ambitious goal. At the current pace of work, the target can be met only by 2027, which is just three years away from achieving the deadline of the Sustainable Development Goal. The Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP) of UNICEF and WHO found in 2015 that around 11.26 per cent of the population practiced open defecation, which was a 2 per cent increase during the 15 years period.



But Anyitike says only 5.8 per cent of the country defecates in the open. He explains that in the first phase of sanitation programme through CLTS in 2012, the open defecation rate was 20.5 per cent. But that does not mean improved sanitation facilities, explains Rwegoshora Rwekaza Makaka, water supply and sanitation specialist with the World Bank group.





Cost matters



Improved sanitation comes with a high price tag. Many of Africa’s relatively prosperous countries find it unaffordable. Take Kenya for example, which aims 100 per cent coverage of safe water and basic sanitation services by 2030. For this, it annually requires US $12.9 billion for water supply, US $4.8 billion for sewerage, US $601 million for basic sanitation and 57 million for basic hygiene. “But, the government budget available for sanitation is only 6.5 per cent,” says Vincent Ouma, of the Kenya Water and Sanitation Civil Societies Network (KEWASNET), a national network of water civil society organisations in Kenya.



Technology options are also limited. According to the Kenya Demographic and Health Survey (2014), over 60 per cent of rural households rely on non-improved sanitation facilities. Different agencies work to promote viable toilet designs. “Most of the toilets are dry pit toilets. The efficacy of such toilets lies in its reusable nature. But due to the lack of acceptance among people for faecal matter to be used as manure, the user usually shuts it down and builds a new toilet or calls the companies to clean it up. The management of faecal matter is our top concern,” says Janet Muse, head, WASH Hub, a dedicated cell of Ministry of Health, Kenya. “The EcoSan Promotion Project is one such pilot project which was implemented in the areas of Nyanza, Western and North Eastern provinces. Despite health, sanitation and economic benefits, this toilets model had very low acceptance among rural households,” adds Janet.



Plan Kenya introduced CLTS in Kenya in May 2007. The idea had instant acceptance. In 2010, Ministry of Public Health and Sanitation embarked a pilot project in the six districts of Nyanza and Western Kenya. Later, the ministry adopted CLTS as a key strategy at national level. This led to the launch of the Open Defecation-Free (ODF) Rural Kenya Campaign in May 2011.



But, meanwhile, it lost the tempo. A study published in East African Medical Journal on assessment of CLTS in rural areas, concluded that it failed to result in open defecation free status as expected. The study cited inadequate monitoring of the process, inadequate funds and conflicting work demands of government officials as the reasons. In 2014, there were only 3,131 certified ODF villages of the 11,641 villages. “Counties need constant support to develop legislations, policies and effectively utilise available financial resources and channelise more resources,” says Kimanthi Kyengo, director, Ministry of Water and Irrigation.



","Notwithstanding this progress, the country typifies Africa’s big challenge: shifting from basic toilets to improved sanitation services.
It also budgeted US $5.5 million for expansion of water, sanitation and hygiene facilities.
Alhaji Sidi Abbas, executive director of Sokoto State Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Agency (RUWASSA), says initially Tangaza local government area of Sokoto state was selected for the project.
But that does not mean improved sanitation facilities, explains Rwegoshora Rwekaza Makaka, water supply and sanitation specialist with the World Bank group.
Despite health, sanitation and economic benefits, this toilets model had very low acceptance among rural households,” adds Janet.",,[],"['meet', 'water', 'target', 'rural', 'health', 'africa', 'sanitation', 'cent', 'supply', 'country', 'toilets', 'open', 'improved']"

September 18, 2018

WITH vast amounts of aid flowing into government coffers and its strategic position boasting one of the busiest shipping lanes, Djibouti ought to be among the wealthiest countries in the African continent.

However, the irony is that the tiny country situated in the eastern coast of Africa is among the poorest, characterised by a crippling sewage crisis that has led to an eruption of water-borne diseases such as cholera and typhoid.

Children are bearing the brunt of the crisis emanating from shocking levels of poor sanitation in the country of about 1 million people.

In rural areas, three out of four people have no access to toilets and relieve themselves in the bush.

In the capital Djibouti City, home to half the country’s population, a quarter of the population has no access to toilet facilities.

With the Horn of Africa a dry zone and with only 20 centimeters or less than 10 inches of rain a year, water is at premium in Djibouti.

Villages often rely on one or two wells, many of which are now contaminated with bacteria linked to human waste.

The 26 300 refugees from Eritrea, Ethiopia, Somalia and Yemen, have added to the problem.

However, Radwan Bahdon, the government’s Director of Sanitation, said the situation was under control.

A new sanitation plant funded by the European Union (EU) is functioning, he added.

“Until 2014, wastewater was discharged into the sea without treatment,” Bahdon said.

Officials lay the blame on the administration of President Ismaïl Omar Guelleh, in office since 1999 after succeeding his uncle- Hassan Gouled Aptidon- who ruled since independence from France in 1977.

Guelleh, whose government is accused of human rights violations, retained power with 90 percent of the vote in February this year.

Vast amounts of aid have flowed into the Treasury over the years but the country has little, if any, to show for it.

Critics accuse Guelleh and his family as well as closest advisors of having significant clout in the economy.

Despite the grinding poverty afflicting the majority, Guelleh recently flew to China in a presidential jet.

Economists warn that Djibouti’s debt is close to its entire GDP but Mr Guelleh has shown no sign of slowing down on the opulence.

“In Djibouti, we are confronted by a family dynasty built on the suffering of our less than 1 million people,” opposition leader, Daher Farah, said of the impoverished country.

Despite its tiny size as the eighth-smallest country in Africa, at 23 200 km2, it is influential.

It has the United States’ only permanent military base in Africa, located at the Fort Lemonier, not far from the presidential palace.

France has its largest unit of the Foreign Legion in Djibouti.

Last year, China opened its first overseas military base-in Djibouti- with room for more troops that the US and France missions combined.

Regarding trade, Djibouti lies on one of the world’s busiest shipping lanes. It is the only route between the Indian Ocean and Suez Canal, a waypoint between Africa, India and the Middle East.

Loans from China have financed the building of a new railway to Ethiopia and cranes hovering over the port and city.

The government earns millions from passing ships.

However, earlier this year, Guelleh signed a decree stripping Dubai firm, DP World, of its 50-year contract to manage the container port.

When a London Court of Arbitration ruled in favour of DP World, government issued a statement it would not recognise the verdict.

The defiance raised fears whether Guelleh could use a similar decree to take back Fort Lemonier.","Children are bearing the brunt of the crisis emanating from shocking levels of poor sanitation in the country of about 1 million people.

• On 21 April, heavy rains triggered widespread flash floods across Djibouti town, affecting many and causing eight fatalities. Additional rainfalls are forecasted throughout the week.

• Hospital Bouffard, where COVID-19 testing facilities are located, was affected, creating disruptions in the operations.

• The Government mobilized to assess the situation and provide support to the population.

SITUATION OVERVIEW

In the night between 20 and 21 April, Djibouti city received 80 mm of rainfall in few hours (half of the annual average), triggering widespread flash floods. Heavy rains also occurred in other areas of the country, causing some damages. In Arta province some 100 mm of rainfall were recorded in the same time span in Damerjog, Chebelley; 110 mm in Iskoutir; and 80mm in PK20. In ali Sabieh province, the capital received 60mm of rainfall, and the refugee village of Ali Addeh 70mm.

Initial estimates indicate that some 18,000 households (approximately 110,000 persons) were somewhat affected across Djibouti city and its suburb of Balbala. At least eight people, including three children and two women lost their lives as their hut – built at the margin of the seasonal river (oued) that separates Djibouti town from Balbala - was washed away by the floodwater.

In Djibouti city, several roads have been inundated and huts were damaged in the Balbala area. The Bouffard hospital, where the COVID-19 testing facility is located, was also flooded, thereby affecting testing operations.

The government immediately mobilized motor pumps and other assets to liberate the main arteries and critical facilities from floodwater.

Social workers from the Ministry of Social Affairs and Solidarity (MASS) were dispatched to assess the situation and identify the most critically affected households. Additional information is being sought.

Whilst the country COVID-19 lockdown continues, many people, especially those living in low areas and prone to flooding, sought refuge in the houses of neighbors and family members. Many have lost their household goods and food.

IOM activated their network and IOM Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM) rapid assessment team engaged with key informants across Djibouti city and Balbala suburb. Many migrants are particularly vulnerable since in many cases their shelters are inappropriate to withstand heavy rains. Interviews indicate that up to 110,000 people (Djiboutian, migrants and refugees) had their houses inundated. The most affected areas include Arhiba (4,000 families), Quartier 7 and Quartier 7bis (2,000 families each), Quartier 6 (1,500 families), Quartier 2 and Quartier 4 and Oued Ambouli (1,000 families each), Einguela and Ambouli (800 families each). All these zones were amongst the most afflicted by the November 2019 floods. In Balbala, some 500 families also suffered losses.

UNHCR tollfree helpline received several requests for support by urban refugees who were most affected by the floods. Initial estimates indicate that some 700 refugee families living in Djibouti city (quartiers 1,2,3,4, Ambouli, Boulaos, Einguela, Arhiba and Balbala) suffered some damages. A team was also dispatched to assess the situation in the refugee villages in the Ali Sabieh province and provide support, in collaboration with authorities.

Against this background, authorities are doing their outmost to continue tracing and testing of COVID19 cases. As of 21 April, the Ministry of Health confirmed 945 cases (99 in the last 24 hours), with 8,955 tests carried out, the highest per capita rate across Africa.","HIGHLIGHTS• On 21 April, heavy rains triggered widespread flash floods across Djibouti town, affecting many and causing eight fatalities.

All too often, travellers abruptly find themselves suffering from a gastrointestinal infection. This condition occurs so regularly that it merits its own name: Traveller’s Diarrhea. The culprits are bacteria, protozoa, viruses, and toxins that are transmitted through contaminated food and water, and poor hand hygiene practices.

Food and water-borne illnesses can occur in any country. When we are travelling, we are more likely to be unfamiliar with our food – we won’t always know where it came from, how it was prepared, or who handled it. Some of us are also more inclined to take risks by trying local delicacies and eating from various food vendors. You can prevent gastrointestinal infections when you know the risks, make safe choices, and practice good hygiene. The golden rule is: Boil it, Cook it, Peel it, or Forget it!

Drinking water safety

Always exercise caution with your drinking water. In areas where hygiene and sanitation are challenging to maintain, taking precautions with drinking water is essential.

Is the tap water safe?

Tap water quality and access to clean drinking water varies from region to region. The safety of the drinking water at your destination depends on context-specific factors such as the local supply and distribution system as well as the monitoring and enforcement of water quality standards.

Water quality can be affected by:

Lack of safe water storage

Old pipes or water treatment systems

Poor sanitation infrastructure

Agricultural run-off

Chemical pollutants

Human or animal waste

Weather-related events such as flooding

Even slight changes in water composition can cause Traveller’s Diarrhea. For example, tap water at your destination will have no ill effect on the local population, but due to different treatment standards there may be higher concentrations or unfamiliar strains of E.coli bacteria present. This can cause diarrhea since you do not develop immunity during short-term exposure.

How to prevent water-borne illnesses

Boil your water

If you are unsure about the tap water quality at your destination, bring the water to a rolling boil. Boiling your water destroys pathogens that can cause gastrointestinal infections such as E. coli, Giardia, and Cryptosporidium. Let your water cool in a covered container overnight and pour it into your reusable water bottle before heading out for the day.

Treated water

Water disinfection methods such as filtration, ultraviolet (UV) light and chemical disinfection can be used if there is no heating source to boil water. To learn about different treatment methods, see the following resource:

Bottled water

Bottled water is another option. However, bottles may be outdated or tampered with. Bottled water is also a large contributor to pollution and contributes to the water crisis. If you do purchase bottled water, do so from a reputable source and check that the bottle cap is properly sealed.

Food safety

Always exercise caution when eating high risk foods. Reduce your risk of illness by practicing food safety and following good hand hygiene practices at your destination.

How food becomes contaminated

Exposure to contaminated food is a common source of gastrointestinal illnesses. Before we eat our food, it encounters growers, processors, storage facilities, retailers, and food handlers that can introduce pathogens such as e. coli, Clostridium botulinum, and salmonella. Contamination can also occur through:

Washing food with untreated water

Cross-contamination of raw and cooked items

Improper cooking, storage, and refrigeration

Unsanitary cooking tools and utensils

Poor hand hygiene

How to prevent food-borne illnesses

High risk foods

Due to increased risk of contamination, travellers should practice caution with the following foods:

Undercooked or raw meat, poultry, seafood, fish, and eggs

Unpeeled fruits, vegetables and leafy greens

Unpasteurized dairy products

Foods that have been unrefrigerated or uncovered for a long time such as buffets

Furthermore, it’s not just about what you eat, it’s also important to consider where you eat. It’s not always easy to know if a restaurant or food vendor follows proper food handling and hygienic practices such as properly cleaning cutting boards and utensils, regularly washing their hands, or correctly refrigerating food. Avoid restaurants and food vendors that appear unclean or that don’t have many customers.

Hand hygiene

Hand washing is key to preventing gastrointestinal infections. Inadvertently ingesting fecal matter, protozoa eggs, bacteria or viruses by touching the mouth with dirty or improperly washed hands is a common source of illness. Always ensure that you wash your hands thoroughly before handling food and after using the bathroom.

See the following resources for more information:

Food Allergies

Travelling with a food allergy? Being prepared is important to prevent an allergic reaction or anaphylactic shock during your trip. See the following resources for more information:

Seafood and shellfish poisoning

Marine foods are a common source of food poisoning that can occur in any country due to the availability of these products (fresh or frozen) around the world. See the following resources for more information:

6 Proposed actions for Environment Pollution Control

As a commerce and trade entry point to Eastern Africa, Djibouti experiences high rates of industrialization,

urbanization, and migration to urban areas. Population influx is mainly from rural people, political migrants,

foreign workers and stowaways . The country is unable to cop e with these insurgences due to lack of

capacity and resources. While, the pressure on the environment is increasing with consequences on

contributing greatly to the rise in air pollution, land degradation, water contaminat ion.

The continuous lack of awareness and resources in the country have contributed to the relatively rampant

solid waste, low air quality and weak control systems. The major sources of pollution in the area are dust

storms, sandstorms, greenhouse gas emission, and other gases from various industries. The main air

pollutants involved are particulate matter, sulfuric diox ide, oxides of nitrogen, ammonia, volatile organic

compounds, persistent organic pollutants, carbon monoxide and heavy metals.

Due to its unbearable hot weathers, environmental consciousness is high among the Djibouti people.

Among the major environmental problems such as drought, desertification, water scarcity in the country,

environmental pollution has not given much attention. Much of the environmental pr oblems are related to

climate variability and climate change. Hence, there is a need to have detailed studi es on the nature, type

and seriousness of environmental pollution in Djibouti and its effects at the cross border and IGA D region

level. Giv en the fact that Djibouti is located at the Horn of Africa, the environmental pollution in Djibouti

will have ripples effects in the neighbouring countries, particularly on Ethiopia and Somalia and the Gulf

Region. This necessitates to do pollution studies and bring research and academic organizations as a

part of the pollution control and sustainable development in the country and in the IGAD region. Besides,

the lack of awareness about pollution and the limited human and financial resources in the r egion has

contributed to the poor prevention and control of pollution in the country.

The following policy recommendation may take into consideration:

• Environmental pollution should need to get higher political attention. As stands now, there

seems to be a sid e- lined issue in Djibouti.

• There is a need to update some of environmental documents, and also need to develop a new

ones;

• There is a need to make the ‘staff and the public’ pollution conscious. Public awareness of

environmental pollution needs to be designed and implemented. Capacity de velopment of

environmental officers in the area of pollution needs to be strengthened;

• There is a need to develop cross - border environmental pollution me asurement and monitoring

between Djibouti and Ethiopia.

I t is vital for the Republic of Djibouti to reduce its pollution without significantly affecting the country’s

economic and social development. For the atmospheric pollution, in the case of the unconditional

scenario, the level of Greenhouse Gases ( GHG ) per Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) point will decrease

from 2.5 in 2000 to 0.8 in 2030. In addition, the planned mitigation measures will support priority economic

sectors like renewable energies and energy efficiency. On its own scale, Djibouti is making signi ficant

contributio ns to reducing global emissions and pollution . As for environmental preservation, it will

constitute one of the major priorities of the Intended National Determination Contr ibution ( IND C) . The

objective in this area is to introduce an integrated approach that makes it possible to take into

consideration all aspects of the issue (the urban, rural, and mining environm ents, atmospheric pollution,

etc.). In this connection, revision of the PANE adopted in 2001 should permit better federation a nd

coordination of the efforts made in this regard. Specific actions will be undertaken in the context of

combating the harmful effects of climate change as well as conserving biodiversity.","While, the pressure on the environment is increasing with consequences oncontributing greatly to the rise in air pollution, land degradation, water contaminat ion.

596,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2011/aug/16/djibouti-forgotten-country-horn-africa-crisis,Djibouti: the forgotten country in the Horn of Africa crisis,"Perhaps because of its small size, Djibouti has received scant attention in media coverage of the current crisis in the Horn of Africa.

The former French colony, bordered by Eritrea, Ethiopia and Somalia, has a population of only 820,000 people, but also faces significant problems. The fourth consecutive year of drought has led to massive loss of livestock, the destruction of crops and increased malnutrition.

There has been an increased migration of pastoralists to the capital, Djibouti, where the urban slum of Balbala has become a small city in its own right.

The recurring droughts have affected 120,000 people, one in eight of the population. According to the UN, pastoralists have lost 70-80% of their livestock, while food prices have risen 50%.

""Loss of income due to drought combined with the food price crisis has forced vulnerable households to allocate a larger share of their income to purchase food at the expense of health and education,"" says the UN.

The worsening security situation in south-central Somalia has compounded problems for the tiny state, host to the only US military base in Africa. There has been a large influx of refugees at the al Addeh refugee camp, whose number is estimated to be 15,000 and growing. This is causing further concern for food security and safe water supply.

""The country's needs are very urgent, although not on the same scale as those of its neighbours,"" said Katherine Roux, who was in Djibouti just over a week ago for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. ""Although it's a small country, the government struggles to reach some rural communities, which feel like they are at the end of the world.""

As an example of an inaccessible rural commmunity, Roux, based in Nairobi, cites Garabtisan village, where some people have only 40 litres of water for a period of two to three days to support the needs of an entire family.

""The nearest water source requires that women walk the distance of 23km, wrote Roux on a recent blog, ""or they wait for water delivery from the military stationed nearby. But with a community of 1,500 people, it is simply impossible for the military to adequately service the needs of Garabtisan village without support.""

Sandra Hu, just back from the country as part of an assessment team for the Red Cross/Red Crescent, said the drought and the lack of access in remote areas to basic services such as health meant the situation was ""chronic"". She also pointed out that high food prices had reduced remittances sent from urban centres.

""Most of the 120,000 people in need are in the north-west and south-west regions where the lack of water is a major problem,"" said Hu, who has been working on a programme to promote micro-loans, targeting women.

Loans have been made to about 950 households, mostly in urban areas to people selling bread, preparing breakfasts and other small catering businesses.

The UN drought appeal for Djibouti has raised $17.4m of a total of $33.3m needed, leaving a shortfall of $15.9m. With funding running at 52% of met needs, Djibouti actually comes second only to Kenya (54%). Ethiopia, with unmet funding needs of 62.4%, is the country that badly needs more international aid.

Some of the major UN agencies are present in Djibouti. The World Food Programme will use some $1.1m to provide emergency food aid for 61,000 people in rural areas. About $1m has been allocated to Unicef, the UN agency for children, for acute malnutrition and water, sanitation and hygiene. The Food and Agriculture Organisation has received nearly $300,000 to rehabilitate water supplies for 8,000 families and their livestock. The World Health Organisation will use some $250,000 to provide mobile health units in rural areas and some $100,000 has been allocated to the UN Population Fund for the reduction of maternal and neonatal mortality. The UN refugee agency has received funds for supplementary food items and water purification equipment at al Addeh refugee camp.

597,https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/djibouti/overview,Djibouti Overview,"The ongoing integrated cash transfer and human capital development (PITCH) project enabled the rapid deployment of cash and in-kind transfers during the first wave of the pandemic in early to mid-2020 and its ensuing lockdown: 27,567 poor and vulnerable households—nearly 154,000 people—living in Djibouti city and Balballa, each received food vouchers worth 30,000FD ($170) over three months. At the same time, cash transfers to 12,300 households in rural and urban areas have continued, of which 4,888 were financed by the Bank. PITCH has also launched accompanying measures for cash transfer beneficiaries to boost human capital development: These include information sessions on key themes, such as nutrition, education, health, and gender-based violence—as well as medical care, provided on the spot at the time of quarterly cash transfer payments through a partnership with the Ministry of Health.

The project is helping the Government continue the development of a national, social registry, which serves as the gateway to nine different social programs, including subsidized health insurance, social housing, food assistance, and cash transfers. The social registry now contains data on 73,281 households, over 1/3 of the population. PITCH is assisting the Government to realize its goal of including refugees in the social registry, so that their eligibility for social programs can be determined—to date, 661 refugee households have been added to the registry under PITCH, with an end of project goal of 1,500.

Finally, the project is putting in place a new community-driven development program that aims to boost access to human capital-related infrastructure in the interior of the country. So that communities can be empowered to identify and execute their sub-projects, a community training program is being developed through a knowledge exchange process with Beninese and Senegalese experts. Sub-project execution is expected to begin in several months in 50 selected sites. The program is being implemented in partnership with Djibouti’s Secretariat of State for Decentralization, regional authorities, and Djibouti Agency for Social Development (ADDS) to promote the greater decentralization of government functions in a highly participatory and transparent manner.

Interventions by the Regional Development Response to Displacement Impacts Project (DRDIP) have improved access to social and economic services and infrastructure for 97,000 beneficiaries (both nationals and refugees in the Ali Sabieh and Obock regions); of the 33,000 host community beneficiaries, 65% are women. More than 1,300 beneficiaries of economic development activities have reported an increase in income.

A concrete example is the extension of main grid lines of the national electricity network to Holl Holl town to benefit over 2,700 households (more than 10,000 beneficiaries). The 100 newly installed public lights are testimony to the realization of a 40-year wait for the residents. About 356 houses, 24 village shops, and a range of public facilities, such as the town’s health center, primary (elementary) and secondary (high) schools and community development center, are benefiting from the individual connections that are currently being established. Major investments include the newly rehabilitated and renovated health center in Ali Addeh, Djibouti, that is serving both refugees and host communities in equal proportion with high-quality health care services. The center is well-staffed and equipped with hospital beds, X-ray machine, and surgery equipment, in clean premises with well-lit wards.

The ongoing Improving Health Sector Performance project has increased the use of quality health care services for maternal and child health. So far, over 300,000 beneficiaries have received quality health care services; more than 90,000 women have received two to four prenatal visits; and 85% of children have been fully immunized before their first birthday. Five primary level community health centers have been upgraded to secondary level polyclinics providing 24-hour emergency and delivery care and outpatient services for a population of close to 100,000.

Situation Overview & Humanitarian Needs

Djibouti is a country of 992,637 population with 27,431 refugees (UNHCR database June 2018). One of the main drivers of humanitarian needs in Djibouti is the chronic drought which affects almost 200,000 people in 2018 (FEWSNET 2017), including 20,000 children under the age of five compared to 130,000 people affected in 2016. The impact of drought is aggravated by additional pressures on already overstretched basic social services by asylum seekers (from Somalia, Eritrea, Ethiopia and recently Yemen) and migrants mostly coming from Ethiopia, Somalia and transiting through Djibouti to the Gulf countries via Yemen. The prolonged drought contributes to high prevalence of acute malnutrition, diarrheal diseases and other infectious diseases.

In May 2018, the tropical cyclone Sagar hit Djibouti causing floods in at least 15 per cent of Djibouti city. The cyclone has exacerbated fragile basic social service systems, causing damage to an estimated 10,000 households (about 150,000 people) with about 2,000 households (10,000 people) severely hit. The major concerns among affected populations focused on access to sanitation, given the damage caused to the city’s poorly designed sanitation system, reduced access to safe drinking water for the most disadvantaged families, including migrants, refugees and internally displaced people (in particular from the Damerjog area close to Djibouti City) and increased fragility of poor households in terms of food scarcity and lack of access to hygiene items. The schools and other social infrastructure have been affected with the total damage estimated at USD30 million (as per the World Bank assessment). UNICEF and other aid agencies upon a rapid assessment of the immediate needs of the affected populations, succeeded in mobilizing about $3 million to respond, with $1.296 million to be managed by UNICEF DCO.","• UNICEF and the Red Crescent of Djibouti conducted a large-scale hygiene promotion campaign with more than 25,000 people being reached on handwashing and household water treatment practices through multiple channels (SMS, face-to-face).

WITH vast amounts of aid flowing into government coffers and its strategic position boasting one of the busiest shipping lanes, Djibouti ought to be among the wealthiest countries in the African continent.

However, the irony is that the tiny country situated in the eastern coast of Africa is among the poorest, characterised by a crippling sewage crisis that has led to an eruption of water-borne diseases such as cholera and typhoid.

Children are bearing the brunt of the crisis emanating from shocking levels of poor sanitation in the country of about 1 million people.

In rural areas, three out of four people have no access to toilets and relieve themselves in the bush.

In the capital Djibouti City, home to half the country’s population, a quarter of the population has no access to toilet facilities.

With the Horn of Africa a dry zone and with only 20 centimeters or less than 10 inches of rain a year, water is at premium in Djibouti.

Villages often rely on one or two wells, many of which are now contaminated with bacteria linked to human waste.

The 26,300 refugees from Eritrea, Ethiopia, Somalia and Yemen, have added to the problem.

However, Radwan Bahdon, the government’s Director of Sanitation, said the situation was under control.

A new sanitation plant funded by the European Union (EU) is functioning, he added.

“Until 2014, wastewater was discharged into the sea without treatment,” Bahdon said.

lay the blame on the administration of President Ismaïl Omar Guelleh, in office since 1999 after succeeding his uncle- Hassan Gouled Aptidon- who ruled since independence from France in 1977.

Guelleh, whose government is accused of human rights violations, retained power with 90 percent of the vote in February this year.

Vast amounts of aid have flowed into the Treasury over the years but the country has little, if any, to show for it.

Critics accuse Guelleh and his family as well as closest advisors of having significant clout in the economy.

Despite the grinding poverty afflicting the majority, Guelleh recently flew to China in a presidential jet.

Economists warn that Djibouti’s debt is close to its entire GDP but Mr Guelleh has shown no sign of slowing down on the opulence.

“In Djibouti, we are confronted by a family dynasty built on the suffering of our less than 1 million people,” opposition leader, Daher Farah, said of the impoverished country.

Despite its tiny size as the eighth-smallest country in Africa, at 23,200 km2, it is influential.

It has the United States’ only permanent military base in Africa, located at the Fort Lemonier, not far from the presidential palace.

France has its largest unit of the Foreign Legion in Djibouti.

Last year, China opened its first overseas military base-in Djibouti- with room for more troops that the US and France missions combined.

Regarding trade, Djibouti lies on one of the world’s busiest shipping lanes. It is the only route between the Indian Ocean and Suez Canal, a waypoint between Africa, India and the Middle East.

Loans from China have financed the building of a new railway to Ethiopia and cranes hovering over the port and city.

The government earns millions from passing ships.

However, earlier this year, Guelleh signed a decree stripping Dubai firm, DP World, of its 50-year contract to manage the container port.

When a London Court of Arbitration ruled in favour of DP World, government issued a statement it would not recognise the verdict.

The defiance raised fears whether Guelleh could use a similar decree to take back Fort Lemonier.

The average annual rainfall is a mere 15 inches, but rain can often be torrential, causing unexpected floods.

Furthermore, the amount of rain varies greatly from year to year, and droughts threaten the already limited supply of water sources every few years or so. Where water sources do exist, the water quality in Eritrea is often poor, contaminated by harmful bacteria.

Around 42 percent of Eritreans live without access to improved drinking water. This means they rely on untreated water that has not been separated from human excrement, which can cause illness and death from diseases such as diarrhea and cholera.

Unsanitary waste systems contribute to this problem. About 85 percent of the country’s population uses unimproved sanitation facilities, which range from improper toilets to defecating in the open. Without proper latrines, fecal matter winds up in local groundwater, contaminating wells and watering holes. An inventory of water supplies in Eritrea found that between 40 to 90 percent were contaminated, and sewage was a major cause.

The vastness of the problem and a lack of societal awareness could mean Eritreans are drinking and using contaminated water without fully understanding the risks. Add water scarcity to the mix, and inhabitants, especially in rural, undeveloped areas, may turn to these contaminated sources because no other options exist in their area.

Flooding causes a different, yet similarly problematic issue, according to UNICEF. Influxes of rushing water can damage sewage and water treatment plants, spreading feces and harmful E. coli bacteria.

The good news is that there are strategies in place to improve sanitation and water quality in Eritrea. The Ministry of Health and UNICEF partnered to implement the Community Led Total Sanitation program in 2007.

As of May 2014, nearly 500 villages declared Open Defecation-Free status. Thirty-one percent of the rural population, 733,000 people, stopped open defecation throughout the country. Plus, the program has trained more than 7,000 village health promoters and educated villagers on proper handwashing to reduce the spread of germs.

Nonprofits like UNICEF and the International Committee of the Red Cross also work with the government to improve access to sanitary water by upgrading water supply systems and wells, installing solar and electric powered water supplies and creating rainwater basins.

Though the deadline has passed, the government continues to work with UNICEF to meet the Millennium Development Goals of improving sanitation and water quality in Eritrea. It will then plan for the Sustainable Development Goals.

The water quality in Eritrea remains a life threatening issue for residents, as well as a humanitarian issue for the government and nonprofits. The country’s climate, lack of freshwater sources and unsanitary waste facilities make access to clean drinking water a major problem for Eritrea. However, the country is committed to making progress to improve the lives of its inhabitants.

All too often, travellers abruptly find themselves suffering from a gastrointestinal infection. This condition occurs so regularly that it merits its own name: Traveller’s Diarrhea. The culprits are bacteria, protozoa, viruses, and toxins that are transmitted through contaminated food and water, and poor hand hygiene practices.

Food and water-borne illnesses can occur in any country. When we are travelling, we are more likely to be unfamiliar with our food – we won’t always know where it came from, how it was prepared, or who handled it. Some of us are also more inclined to take risks by trying local delicacies and eating from various food vendors. You can prevent gastrointestinal infections when you know the risks, make safe choices, and practice good hygiene. The golden rule is: Boil it, Cook it, Peel it, or Forget it!

Drinking water safety

Always exercise caution with your drinking water. In areas where hygiene and sanitation are challenging to maintain, taking precautions with drinking water is essential.

Is the tap water safe?

Tap water quality and access to clean drinking water varies from region to region. The safety of the drinking water at your destination depends on context-specific factors such as the local supply and distribution system as well as the monitoring and enforcement of water quality standards.

Water quality can be affected by:

Lack of safe water storage

Old pipes or water treatment systems

Poor sanitation infrastructure

Agricultural run-off

Chemical pollutants

Human or animal waste

Weather-related events such as flooding

Even slight changes in water composition can cause Traveller’s Diarrhea. For example, tap water at your destination will have no ill effect on the local population, but due to different treatment standards there may be higher concentrations or unfamiliar strains of E.coli bacteria present. This can cause diarrhea since you do not develop immunity during short-term exposure.

How to prevent water-borne illnesses

Boil your water

If you are unsure about the tap water quality at your destination, bring the water to a rolling boil. Boiling your water destroys pathogens that can cause gastrointestinal infections such as E. coli, Giardia, and Cryptosporidium. Let your water cool in a covered container overnight and pour it into your reusable water bottle before heading out for the day.

Treated water

Water disinfection methods such as filtration, ultraviolet (UV) light and chemical disinfection can be used if there is no heating source to boil water. To learn about different treatment methods, see the following resource:

Bottled water

Bottled water is another option. However, bottles may be outdated or tampered with. Bottled water is also a large contributor to pollution and contributes to the water crisis. If you do purchase bottled water, do so from a reputable source and check that the bottle cap is properly sealed.

Food safety

Always exercise caution when eating high risk foods. Reduce your risk of illness by practicing food safety and following good hand hygiene practices at your destination.

How food becomes contaminated

Exposure to contaminated food is a common source of gastrointestinal illnesses. Before we eat our food, it encounters growers, processors, storage facilities, retailers, and food handlers that can introduce pathogens such as e. coli, Clostridium botulinum, and salmonella. Contamination can also occur through:

Washing food with untreated water

Cross-contamination of raw and cooked items

Improper cooking, storage, and refrigeration

Unsanitary cooking tools and utensils

Poor hand hygiene

How to prevent food-borne illnesses

High risk foods

Due to increased risk of contamination, travellers should practice caution with the following foods:

Undercooked or raw meat, poultry, seafood, fish, and eggs

Unpeeled fruits, vegetables and leafy greens

Unpasteurized dairy products

Foods that have been unrefrigerated or uncovered for a long time such as buffets

Furthermore, it’s not just about what you eat, it’s also important to consider where you eat. It’s not always easy to know if a restaurant or food vendor follows proper food handling and hygienic practices such as properly cleaning cutting boards and utensils, regularly washing their hands, or correctly refrigerating food. Avoid restaurants and food vendors that appear unclean or that don’t have many customers.

Hand hygiene

Hand washing is key to preventing gastrointestinal infections. Inadvertently ingesting fecal matter, protozoa eggs, bacteria or viruses by touching the mouth with dirty or improperly washed hands is a common source of illness. Always ensure that you wash your hands thoroughly before handling food and after using the bathroom.

See the following resources for more information:

Food Allergies

Travelling with a food allergy? Being prepared is important to prevent an allergic reaction or anaphylactic shock during your trip. See the following resources for more information:

Seafood and shellfish poisoning

Marine foods are a common source of food poisoning that can occur in any country due to the availability of these products (fresh or frozen) around the world. See the following resources for more information:

602,https://www.unv.org/Success-stories/Delivering-community-owned-water-and-sanitation-solutions-Eritrea-UNICEF,Delivering community-owned water and sanitation solutions in Eritrea with UNICEF,"According to UNICEF-WHO Joint Monitoring Programme data from 2015, only 16 per cent of the population in Eritrea have access to basic sanitation facilities and 76 per cent practice open defecation.

I support my team in achieving SDG 6 through planning and monitoring of programme activities and enhancing the capacity of government partners to enhance their monitoring and reporting.

For a sustainable development approach, it is necessary that the community take ownership and understand the benefit for its members. So, for better sanitation and hygiene practices, we adopt the community-led total sanitation approach. Accordingly, community leaders raise awareness of members of the importance of remaining free of open defecation and adopting better hygiene practices.

To achieve their goal, a village in Anseba used some locally-adopted rules to accelerate making their village free of open defecation. This included instating a penalty of 100 Nakfa (equivalent to US $7) for violations, and obligating the perpetrator to remove and dispose of faeces away from the village. This has had a positive impact on community health, with people now reporting a significant decrease in the diarrhoeal diseases.

It used to be very difficult to defecate in the open before the community-led sanitation triggering was started, especially during pregnancy and menstruation. We needed to go far from the village for privacy, also at night, when we could be cut by stones or bitten by insects. It was tough for us physically and it was a security risk as well. The latrines give us dignity and convenience. --a woman in Anseba region

Through the triggering and advocacy, communities were empowered to investment in latrines at their own cost. Villages also appointed hygiene promoters, who were responsible for 20 households each. This provided a structure for mutual community reinforcement and motivation for the greater good. In building the latrines, the community members shared the labour and did the physical work together, particularly in support of poorer families who were unable to manage on their own.

UNICEF supported the water resources department in implementing water supply systems in the villages, where they dug wells to tap underground water sources.

For the sustainability of the water supply systems, they are handed over to the WASH committee for operation and functionality management.

We collect a minimal charge for water of 1 Nakfa per 20 litres from the community members, which is then used for the maintenance and operation of the system. --a WASH committee member

Other challenges to the smooth operation of the system were the unavailability of a skilled technician, lack of availability of spare parts locally and high cost of fuel for fuel-powered generators.

UNICEF Eritrea has started to adopt solar-powered systems as a more energy-saving and environment-friendly approach. The organization is also in discussion with government partners to ease access to spare parts hub at Zoba (regional) and sub-Zoba level.

As a UN Volunteer in Eritrea for over one and half years now, working to deliver community-owned WASH solutions has been my greatest professional milestone. --Bipin Jha, UN Volunteer WASH Officer with UNICEF, Eritrea

People in the community expressed their gratitude for the improvement in their health and sanitation, as they can get safe water at their village after they used to travel at least three kilometres to get unsafe water.","So, for better sanitation and hygiene practices, we adopt the community-led total sanitation approach.

603,https://www.ifrc.org/en/news-and-media/news-stories/africa/eritrea/a-long-term-solution-to-eritreas-water-shortage/,A long-term solution to Eritrea’s water shortage,"The village of Balwa is small but surprisingly busy. Wooden huts line the roadside the length of the village, each with tables and chairs set up under the shade of coconut matting, in an attempt to attract passing trade.

Situated on the winding, mountainous road between Asmara, Eritrea’s capital, and the regional capital, Keren, Balwa is an increasingly popular place for travellers to break their journey.

At the busiest times, several buses and trucks are parked in the village, their passengers sitting in cafes or on the ground, under trees. Some buy soft drinks or coffee, but in the scorching summer heat, everyone needs water, for washing, drinking or simply cooling down.

For the villagers the business is welcome. Like much of Eritrea, the region around Keren is suffering from a severe drought after years of poor rainfall. Successive harvests have failed, grain prices have increased and local people have been forced to find alternative ways to earn money to feed their families.

In a largely agricultural area, Balwa is one of the few villages with a chance to become less dependent on farming. But the daily influx of visitors has placed enormous pressure on its water supplies. The local water table has dropped over the past few months and the village well can barely supply Balwa’s inhabitants. There is nothing to spare for the hundreds of daily visitors.

Desperate to solve their water problems, the villagers, together with the Red Cross Society of Eritrea (RCSE), have proposed a long term solution.

With the backing of the International Federation, they plan to build a sub-surface dam in the village. The dam would collect water during the rainy season and store it underground.

The water would be cleaned by a natural sand filter which would make it safe to use. As well as storing excess water, the dam, which would be the first of its kind to be built in the area, would also improve the capacity of the village well by maintaining the water table at a higher level.

“Balwa is a truck-stop, so there is a permanent community and also a transitory one, which doubles the population. They use a lot of water, water which the village does not have,” said Edoardo Casetta, the Federation’s water and sanitation delegate in Eritrea. He estimates that the water table in the area has dropped by up to two metres in the past few months.

Balwa’s unique geological situation means that it is a good location for a sub-surface dam, says Casetta. “It is situated in a valley, and so it has natural walls on each side, it is also at the neck of a river,” he says.

The project relies on community participation and the village water committee is playing a key role in the project. Villagers have been organized into work teams and much of the preparation for building the dam has already been completed. Stones have been collected and construction is due to start in time for this year’s rainy season.

If the dam proves successful more could be built in the region. Such interventions are urgently needed all over Eritrea, according to the Famine Early Warning System (FEWS) Network, which reports that the water situation is critical across the country.

“Reservoirs have not recharged, shallow wells have dried up and the water table has fallen, reducing the yield of boreholes, and in some cases pumps have burned out,” FEWS reports.

“Protecting access to water is a major priority,” the agency concludes in its latest report.

Long-term water projects are also considered to be a vital way of combating Eritrea’s worsening food crisis.

Global acute malnutrition for children under five is around 20 per cent, with a severe malnutrition rate of two per cent, according to data compiled by the UN Children’s Fund, UNICEF.

Balwa’s inhabitants are anxious for work on the dam to begin. Many see it as their only hope for the future. As she wipes a floral plastic tablecloth outside her wooden hut turned cafe, Semret says: “We need something to happen here as we cannot continue like this.

“Balwa is next to a busy road so we have a chance to make a living. Otherwise we might have to move somewhere else. The land alone can no longer support us, we need to change the way we live if we want to survive in this place.”","In a largely agricultural area, Balwa is one of the few villages with a chance to become less dependent on farming.
The local water table has dropped over the past few months and the village well can barely supply Balwa’s inhabitants.
They use a lot of water, water which the village does not have,” said Edoardo Casetta, the Federation’s water and sanitation delegate in Eritrea.
He estimates that the water table in the area has dropped by up to two metres in the past few months.
The project relies on community participation and the village water committee is playing a key role in the project.",,[],"['water', 'dam', 'village', 'eritreas', 'solution', 'work', 'eritrea', 'wooden', 'table', 'balwa', 'longterm', 'shortage', 'area', 'villagers']"

Especially rural areas have problems providing a year-round supply of sufficiently clean water, which is crucial for further development. As more and more traditional wells dry up during the dry season, the walks to the nearest watering holes become longer and longer. In cooperation with the organization ArcheMed e.V., which has been operating for many years in Eritrea, this infrastructure project is planned to provide clean water for a village.The project region is located in Begu Valley, approximately 100 km from the capital Asmara. There are a few villages in this area leading a simple, agricultural life. For some impressions of the project region, here is a video from the expedition: https://vimeo.com/116485353 During our first expedition in April 2014 we investigated several suitable locations suitable for the construction of a water supply. Thereby, one location on a hillside appeared to be specifically suitable for the construction of sand storage dams. In September 2015 the reconditioning of a borehole resulted in a temporary relieve of the water scarcity. The long term goal however is the construction of a sand storage dam to ensure a safe and sustainable water supply. The planned dam will be therefore approximately 8 meters high and have a sufficient water reservoir for a yearlong water supply of the village. The construction of the infrastructure is accompanied by an intense knowledge exchange between local and German engineers and students as well as a wide range of workshops in the field of water, sanitation and hygiene for the local community. It is also them who perform the actual construction work together with the local engineers.The start of the construction work was at the beginning of 2017, since then the construction continues step by step with every rain event. While the work for the wing walls will most likely be finished within summer 2019, the construction period for the centre part is highly dependent on rainfall and will last approximately until summer 2022. Thanks to the innovative construction method a maximum efficiency and longevity is reached. At the same time the dam is also already now functionally, though with less steps respectively, and providing an increasingly important contribution to the water supply of the community.Thanks to your donations and a co-funding of the German BMZ until end of October 2018, roughly 80% of the overall construction volume has been completed. In order to finalize the project and finance the final meters, we are after the end of the BMZ-funding fully dependent on private funding.We have already achieved a lot thanks to your support and we hope to complete also this last phase of the project now successfully together with you!","Especially rural areas have problems providing a year-round supply of sufficiently clean water, which is crucial for further development.

Torrential rains have triggered devastating floods and landslides across East Africa in recent weeks, aggravating an already challenging situation as countries in the region battle the coronavirus pandemic.

The destruction caused by the heavy rainfall has killed hundreds of people in Kenya, Uganda, Somalia, Rwanda and Ethiopia and has also forced hundreds of thousands from their homes.

This week, officials in Kenya and Rwanda said nearly 200 and 65 people had died in both countries, respectively, with floodwaters and mudslides destroying houses, washing away bridges and straining critical infrastructure.

On Saturday, Kenyan and Uganda suffered nationwide electricity outages, leaving tens of millions of people without power.

Health experts are worried about the implications of the flooding on the countries’ response to the coronavirus pandemic.

“This is compounding the COVID-19 response,” Kenya Health Ministry Chief Administrative Secretary Rashid Aman said.

“The displaced people have been forced to congregate in makeshift camps with the risk of banding together exposing them to the possibility of contracting the virus.”

Floodwaters also recently swept away most parts of an entire small town in Somalia and swept away roads, bridges and a hospital in Uganda.

Heavy rains flooded areas around Mountain Rwenzori in western Uganda after Nyamwamba River burst its banks, forcing people to seek refuge in nearby schools and destroying roads and bridges, according to officials.

“What complicates the matter is that this is the era of COVID. People are expected to maintain social distance, but how do you maintain distance in such a situation?” Julius Mucunguzi, spokesman for the prime minister’s office, was quoted as saying by the Reuters News Agency.

One of the hospitals in the area, Kilembe, was also washed away despite being built on a raised bank and reinforced with sandbags.

“There are wards which were completely washed away. The mortuary was swept away. You wouldn’t know that once upon a time there was a mortuary there. The drugs and drug stores were washed away,” Mucunguzi said.

The Somali region in eastern Ethiopia has also been hard hit by the floods, with more than 100,000 people displaced, the United Nations Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs said.

Meanwhile, an unspecified number of people were killed in the semi-autonomous Puntland region in Somalia when flash floods swept away most buildings in Qardho town, officials said.

The heavy rains stem from moisture dumped in the region by winds coming in from the Indian Ocean where temperatures have risen in recent months, said Chris Shisanya, a professor of climatology at Kenyatta University in Kenya’s capital, Nairobi.

“This is a carry-over of what we had last year,” he said, referring to floods and landslides in the region.

The floods are coming as swarms of locusts are wreaking havoc across East Africa where millions of people struggle for food.

Billions of desert locusts have already chomped their way through Ethiopia, Somalia, Kenya, Djibouti, Eritrea, Tanzania, Sudan and Uganda.

Their breeding has been spurred by one of the wettest rainy seasons in the region in four decades.","Torrential rains have triggered devastating floods and landslides across East Africa in recent weeks, aggravating an already challenging situation as countries in the region battle the coronavirus pandemic.

Part of the road to the town had been cut off.

Wendy Rappeport, spokeswoman for the UN refugee agency (UNHCR) in Eritrea which carries out much of its work in the Tesseney area, confirmed that the seasonal rains were exceptionally heavy this year.

She told IRIN however that as yet, there had been no reports of damage in the areas where refugees were returning from Sudan. Tens of thousands of returnees, assisted by UNHCR, have been arriving in western Eritrea over the last three years.

""We are monitoring the situation very closely,"" she added.

Meanwhile, in neighbouring Sudan the UN and NGOs have appealed for US $8.6 million to help tens of thousands of people left homeless by severe flooding in the Kassala area.

Excessive rainfall in the Eritrean highlands, alongside localised rains, caused the Gash river to burst its banks late last month. Thirteen people have been killed and 56 injured, while thousands of houses have been destroyed along with Kassala town's only hospital.

The first of four Red Cross/Crescent flights arrived in the flood-stricken town at the weekend, delivering much-needed relief - including a mass sanitation unit.

The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies described the health situation as alarming, with a five-fold increase in acute diarrhoea and a dramatic rise in malaria cases.

""Many of Kassala's 350,000 inhabitants are living in precarious conditions with no shelter or access to drinking water or sanitation facilities, in the aftermath of what is being described as the worst floods to have hit the area in the last 70 years,"" the IFRC said in a statement.

It said the Sudanese government had declared Kassala a disaster zone.

612,https://reliefweb.int/report/eritrea/eritrea-drought-major-cause-hardship,Eritrea: Drought a major cause of hardship - Eritrea,"[This report does not necessarily reflect the views of the United Nations]ASMARA, 27 July (IRIN) - Of all the natural disasters that strike communities and environments, a drought can be the most devastating. If it develops into a full-blown famine or forces people to leave their homes or become dependent on external food aid, drought becomes a humanitarian crisis.

Unlike the more dramatic ""acts of God"", such as volcanoes, earthquakes or tsunamis, the full impact of a drought is more closely related to a country's ability to respond or mitigate the failure of rains.

Fragile state structures, underdeveloped infrastructure, poor agricultural practices and issues of governance are as important in this equation as the absence of water itself.

Travelling around Eritrea, one often finds young boys digging in dry river beds to find water for their bony animals, or a slow procession of donkeys and their owners carrying water home through the heat of the day.

The water table throughout the country has dropped by several metres, relief workers and government officials say, thanks to a drought that has dragged on for years.

""We have had very, very little rain, especially in the past three or four years,"" Ali Abdu, Eritrea's information minister, told IRIN in May. ""Almost one-third of our population was attacked by that.""

Some 2.3 million people in Eritrea, almost two-thirds of the population, depend on varying levels of food aid. And although 80 percent of the population is rural, the country only produced 85,000 mt of cereals in 2004 - just 15 percent of its annual requirement and 47 percent of its average harvest over the last twelve years.

One million Eritreans are likely to go hungry this year, unless donors can step up their food aid, a senior government official said.

While it would be easy to pin the blame on long-term drought and the exhaustion of coping strategies, relief workers in Eritrea say these are not the only reasons for the country's precarious food-security situation.

""Food security is more complicated than getting enough rain, or even producing enough food,"" said a relief worker who did not want to be named. He felt that the failure to produce adequate food crops since 1998 was also linked to Eritrea's conflict with Ethiopia and its preparations to strengthen defences on the border.

The 1998-2000 Ethiopian-Eritrean border war, which was fought mostly in Eritrean territory, killed between 70,000 and 100,000 people and displaced almost one-third of Eritrea's population.

It also left behind an unpleasant legacy of mines and battered infrastructure throughout the border region, and especially in Eritrea's most fertile region in the southwest.

Relations between the two countries have hardly improved since the end of the conflict. When they signed a peace agreement in December 2000, both countries agreed that an independent boundary commission would make a ""final and binding"" decision on where the border should be.

However, the Boundary Commission decision, produced in April 2002, was later rejected by Ethiopia.

Three years on, the position of both countries remains essentially the same: Ethiopia says it will demarcate the border but would like to negotiate first (although it appears unwilling to do so). Meanwhile, Eritrea refuses to compromise on an international agreement.

So, how has a border dispute affected Eritrea's rapidly declining food security?

The most obvious impact is the redistribution of resources and manpower: An estimated 300,000 people are currently serving in Eritrea's military instead of contributing to the country's economy. In addition, government sources said, the dispute has forced Eritrea to put a lot of its scarce resources into military spending. Along with fuel shortages and rising prices of consumer goods, the already weak economy has declined.

""We are dealing with four years of consecutive drought,"" Yemane Gebremeskal, presidential advisor and chief government spokesman, told IRIN in an interview at his office in May. ""This [drought] has eroded coping mechanisms and is putting severe pressure on the government. The overall security situation has also [had] an impact.""

Following an assessment visit to Eritrea at the end of 2004, the UN World Food Programme (WFP) and the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) said in a January 2005 report: ""Due to continued critical shortage of labour, the wage rates this year have been observed to be very high.

""Since farmers cannot afford to pay such high wages [.] critical field operations such as weeding have generally been neglected,"" the WFP/FAO report added.

A separate report issued in April by the USAID-funded Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS Net), said: ""The absence of many young men for national mobilisation reduces the range of household income opportunities and coping strategies, such as livestock-raising and off-farm employment.""

It is important to out that some of Eritrea's most fertile land is within the Temporary Security Zone (TSZ), a 25-km wide demilitarised zone that runs along Eritrea's southern boundary and is still patrolled by UN peacekeepers.

The TSZ once accounted for a significant proportion of Eritrean food production. Currently, an estimated 50,000 internally displaced Eritreans live away from the TSZ, unable to return to their ruined villages until the last of the landmines planted there during the war are cleared.

Eritrea's borders with both Ethiopia and Sudan remain officially closed while tensions in the region persist. The border with Sudan was closed in late 2002, with both sides accusing each other of supporting armed opposition in the other's territory.

The border closures have affected the agricultural sector in two significant ways, by limiting grazing areas and by restricting access to markets.

Pastoralists can no longer follow rains across national boundaries. Regional tensions have severely limited the coping strategies of pastoralists, who were once the powerhouse of Eritrean agriculture. The government has been encouraging pastoralists to settle, but adaptation has not been easy, sources say.

""We have not had a census for a long time, but pastoralism is still a very important sector,"" a source said. ""Normally, if they move, they go in search of pasture. But now very few are moving because of the closed borders. So the pressure on forage is worse than ever before,"" he added.

The closed borders have also blocked a key supply of food, driving food prices higher.

""The loss of access to Ethiopian and Sudanese food markets, on which Eritrea traditionally depended for about one-third of its primary food supply, may have contributed to the current escalation of food grains prices in Eritrea,"" said the FEWS Net report.

?There [are] no food shortages in Eritrea at the present time. Last year, we had a bumper harvest. We have also built up our reserves in terms of food stocks by importing food, so we will be ready for any emergency,? said Ghebreab.

His comments came after U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Johnnie Carson was quoted as saying ?Eritrea is a closed and increasingly reclusive country, and its government has not been particularly helpful in sharing data and information about the severity of the food shortages or the drought in its country.?

Carson also encouraged Eritrea to be open about the needs of its population.

An appeal by the UK’s Disaster Emergency Appeal has raised over £54m four weeks after it was launched. But unlike the victims in Somalia, Ethiopia and Kenya, the people of Eritrea are unable to benefit from this generosity.

The reason for this tragedy is simple: the Eritrean regime, led by the dictatorial Isaias Afewerki, is refusing all outside help. Denial is official government policy. Quoting the President the official media declared in January 2016: “The country will not face any crisis in spite of reduced agricultural output.”

But evidence of the scale of the suffering, particularly among the children, is now filtering out. It is being smuggled out by men and women of the ""Freedom Friday"" resistance network, at great personal risk. If they are discovered they will be jailed, indefinitely, and almost certainly tortured.

Nurses and carers working in clinics across the country have been banned from using their cell-phones, but some have dared to take the images below (click to reveal the full picture), and sent them abroad, in a desperate attempt to make the plight of these children know.

These photographs are from the town of Mendefera. Normally a bustling market town, in the fertile Southern region of Eritrea, it has a range of small scale factories that provide employment and an income.

But villagers in the vicinity, including Areza, Mai Dima, Awha, Adi Quala, Mai Mine, Enda Gergis, Adi Felesti, have been badly hit by the drought. These pictures are from the clinic in Mendefera, to which the children have been brought. The pictures and the information has been anonymized, for their security.

Since January this year 66 children, many of them babies, have been brought into the clinic suffering from acute forms of malnutrition the clinics were unable to cope with. Many revived, but two died and a further four children were sent to Asmara for specialist treatment.

They suffered from the swollen bellies typical of kwashiorkor, a severe type of malnutrition - the result of an extreme shortage of protein in their diet. The symptoms include swollen abdomens, skin disorders (hypo and hyper pigmented skin) and excessive fluid retention throughout the body.

Health workers believe they are only seeing the tip of the iceberg. Most children are simply not being brought to the clinics and the actual scale of the crisis is much more severe.

A national crisis

In other areas of the country the situation is, if anything, more dangerous.

There are reports of cholera in the area around the western town of Barentu. Villagers are having to draw water from pits dug into the Mereb river.

More than 1,300 patients were registered at one makeshift clinic when these images were smuggled out of the country in October last year. Thirteen deaths had been registered by the health workers. Teams of doctors were sent into the area to try to halt the spread of the cholera while roads were closed, transport halted and movement into and out of the effected areas has been tightly controlled. Members of the local militia, the police and the army were closely restricting movement.

There were reports of medical teams being sent to attend the cholera outbreak in remote areas, leaving their the patients in hospital unattended. The medics said there is constant pressure from security agents, who warn them warn them not to take any photos not and tell any one about what is taking place.

An aid worker operating inside Sudan described families crossing the border to seek aid. He said that those who arrived spoke of acute shortages of food and water. These people come from the remote regions of western Eritrea where villagers are used to some of the most challenging of circumstances. If they believe it is time to pack up and leave the situation must be very serious indeed.

Government in denial

Obtaining accurate information from Eritrea is extremely difficult, since the government prevents aid agencies and many UN organisations from operating.

As one crisis warning system put it: “The Eritrean government severely restricts the access of humanitarian actors inside the country. Very little is known about humanitarian needs: Unicef estimates that the total affected population is 1.5 million.”

The UN’s children’s agency, Unicef, reported that: “Data from the Nutrition Sentinel Site Surveillance system indicates an increase in malnutrition rates over the past few years in four out of six regions of the country, with 22,700 children under five projected to be affected by severe acute malnutrition (SAM) in 2017.

This crisis was not unforeseen.

A year ago, aid agencies were already warning that the situation was looking bleak. Satellite imagery showed the scale of the looming drought.

Current maps of the region now show no information for Eritrea: it is almost as if the country has vanished from the face of the earth.

Eritreans have become the silent victims of their President’s unwillingness to call for aid, and the inability of the international community to come to their aid.","The coming famine across the Horn was covered by the New Statesman a year ago, with predictions of its severity which have tragically come true.

Testimonies pieced together since 2017 provide new insights into life in four prisons; Adi Abeyito prison, Mai Serwa Maximum prison and Mai Serwa Asmera Flowers detention camp, which are within 2-3km from each other, and about 6km north of the capital Asmara; and Ala, an all-male prison located 66km south of Asmara.

With overcrowding and general lack of adequate sanitation, healthcare and food, conditions in these detention facilities are inhumane and a cause of major concern in the face of COVID-19. Deprose Muchena, Amnesty International Director for East and Southern Africa

“With overcrowding and general lack of adequate sanitation, healthcare and food, conditions in these detention facilities are inhumane and a cause of major concern in the face of COVID-19. No one should be held in conditions that can have disastrous consequences on their mental and physical health,” said Deprose Muchena, Amnesty International’s Director for East and Southern Africa.

At Adi Abeyito, which currently holds about 2,500 people in a space designed for 800, detainees are allowed to shower and wash their clothes twice a week. However, in the other three facilities, detainees are rarely allowed to bathe or wash their clothes. Shoes and slippers are strictly prohibited to prevent detainees from jumping over barbed wire fencing.

Authorities do not provide personal hygiene products like soap, so detainees rely on their families for supplies. But since 2 April 2020, there has been a total lockdown of prisons with no visitors allowed in, cutting off the very supplies needed to keep COVID-19 and other diseases out of prisons.

No one should be held in conditions that can have disastrous consequences on their mental and physical health. Deprose Muchena, Amnesty International's Director for East and Southern Africa

“Detainees in Eritrea are at great risk of contracting infectious diseases because of the overcrowded and unsanitary conditions they are being held in,” said Deprose Muchena.

At the Mai Serwa Asmera Flowers facility, in reality a forced labour camp where Jehovah’s Witnesses and other detainees are forced to work on flower farms, there are no toilets for detainees. All 700 of them, both men and women, relieve themselves out in the open. At Mai Serwa Maximum Security prison, there are only 20 toilets for 500 detainees.

In Adi Abeyito, detainees can relieve themselves only twice daily in toilets located outside the compound. The prison has toilets within its grounds reserved for use in the rainy season or extraordinary circumstances such as suspected strikes or prison breaks. In 2015, detainees raised money and built a toilet in each detention hall to cater for the needs of the sick, elderly or those with disabilities.

No social distance

The four prisons are extremely congested; Adi Abeyito holds more than four times its capacity of 800 people, Ala prison holding about triple its capacity of 1,200 people while Mai Serwa has more than double its 230-person capacity.

The vast majority have never been formally charged or brought to court and do not know when, or if, their detention will end.

They are held in spaces ranging from 2x2m cells for solitary confinement at the Mai Serwa Maximum prison, to shipping containers holding more than 20 detainees, and halls measuring up to 10x20m. Detainees generally take turns to sleep on bare floors because beds or mattresses are not allowed.

This Independence Day everyone should be asking, why are they in prison? #Eritrea #PFDJ #Injustice pic.twitter.com/kHYg9yfJEj — MUSSA / MUSSIE for P R E S I D E N T (@AAOdds_Eritrea) May 17, 2020

They are fed a standard diet of tea and bread in the morning, and bread with lentil sauce for lunch and supper. Security guards hand out the food in detention halls and cells because detainees are not allowed to leave their cramped holding places except to go to the toilet, or to the infirmary.

Their meals were supplemented by families visiting once a week, but the COVID-19 lockdown has cut off this supply line, putting detainees at greater risk of malnutrition and illness and disease.

First aid no match for serious illnesses

Testimonies received by Amnesty International reveal that detainees in all four detention facilities suffer a wide range of serious ailments including mental illnesses, high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease, anemia, diarrhea, asthma, tuberculosis, eye and ear infections, and gastro-intestinal infections. But they are attended to by health workers who only have first aid training.

Detainees pay for medication, infirmaries within detention facilities lacking even the most basic medical equipment such as thermometers. At Ala prison, detainees had to raise money to buy a thermometer and a blood pressure monitor that detained doctors use to help the sick monitor some of their conditions.

Very sick detainees at Ala prison are taken to a hospital 26 Km away in Dekemahare town, some dying on the way. The critically ill at Adi Abiyeto and other nearby prisons are taken to Halibet Hospital in Asmara every Friday.

The Eritrean authorities must free all prisoners of conscience and consider releasing children, pre-trial detainees and those who may be more vulnerable to COVID-19, including the sick and older people. Deprose Muchena, Amnesty International's Director for East and Southern Africa

“Too many detainees are wasting away in unofficial detention facilities across the country with no idea what will become of them. The Eritrean authorities have a duty to ensure that all detainees have access to adequate food, water, sanitation facilities and healthcare. They must also free all prisoners of conscience and consider releasing children, pre-trial detainees and those who may be more vulnerable to COVID-19, including the sick and older people,” said Deprose Muchena.","With overcrowding and general lack of adequate sanitation, healthcare and food, conditions in these detention facilities are inhumane and a cause of major concern in the face of COVID-19.

Water Resources Development; Water Resources Monitoring; Water Resources Management. Background



Eritrea has made progress over the past few decades in improving access to water. However, significant gaps remain. Addressing these gaps is essential to the protection and well-being of communities, as well as to improving public health, reducing poverty, and advancing the social and economic development of Eritreans.



The Government of the State of Eritrea is committed to ensuring that all people enjoy enough quality water and it also gives water top priority in all development initiatives and across all ministries and sectors. According to the Eritrea Population and Health Survey 2010 (EPHS), 49.9 percent of the rural population had access to improved water supplies, compared to 72.9 per cent of the urban population, averaging 57.9 per cent nationally. The coverage of improved drinking water increased to 68.7 per cent nationally in 2018.



Eritrea also launched one of the most successful water supply initiatives during this period, investing in the large-scale development of water systems capitalizing on rainwater. Building on and sustaining the progress achieved during the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) period is critical to reaching the 2030 SDGs.



Given that Eritrea is prone to severe drought, food insecurity, increasingly extreme rainfall patterns, and higher temperatures, UNICEF is one of the partners supporting the government of Eritrea to implement climate resilient WASH interventions as part of the 2019-2030 OneWASH strategy and investment plan. WASH sector bottleneck analysis conducted in 2018 identified limited data and information on water resources potential, use, monitoring and management, and inadequate technology, innovations and products for water resources development, monitoring and management as the main challenges facing the water sector in the country.



Objective



The overall objective of the conference is to share with development partners the challenges and opportunities for WASH provision in Eritrea, strategic shifts, and resources required to achieve SDG targets related to water supply and leave on behind. Specifically, the conference seeks to achieve:

1. Share experience and knowledge on equity focus, including gender responsive, water supply and water resources management in Eritrea.

2. Create a platform for the government, UN agencies, private companies, academic and research institutions, development partners and others to explore potential collaboration and partnership to exploit, develop and monitor water resources in Eritrea,

3. Explore the possible use of innovations and technology to enhance the monitoring and development of water sources.

4. Draw key recommendations on the way forward aligned with the 2019-2030 OneWASH strategy and investment plan.



Expected outcomes



• A better understanding of the water resources potential of Eritrea and climate-resilient actions essential to the future sustainability of water sources in the country

• Strategic partnerships and collaborations initiated to develop better, monitor and manage water resources in Eritrea

• Technologies, innovations, and products identified for water resources mapping, development, monitoring, and management

I support my team in achieving SDG 6 through planning and monitoring of programme activities and enhancing the capacity of government partners to enhance their monitoring and reporting.

For a sustainable development approach, it is necessary that the community take ownership and understand the benefit for its members. So, for better sanitation and hygiene practices, we adopt the community-led total sanitation approach. Accordingly, community leaders raise awareness of members of the importance of remaining free of open defecation and adopting better hygiene practices.

To achieve their goal, a village in Anseba used some locally-adopted rules to accelerate making their village free of open defecation. This included instating a penalty of 100 Nakfa (equivalent to US $7) for violations, and obligating the perpetrator to remove and dispose of faeces away from the village. This has had a positive impact on community health, with people now reporting a significant decrease in the diarrhoeal diseases.

It used to be very difficult to defecate in the open before the community-led sanitation triggering was started, especially during pregnancy and menstruation. We needed to go far from the village for privacy, also at night, when we could be cut by stones or bitten by insects. It was tough for us physically and it was a security risk as well. The latrines give us dignity and convenience. --a woman in Anseba region

Through the triggering and advocacy, communities were empowered to investment in latrines at their own cost. Villages also appointed hygiene promoters, who were responsible for 20 households each. This provided a structure for mutual community reinforcement and motivation for the greater good. In building the latrines, the community members shared the labour and did the physical work together, particularly in support of poorer families who were unable to manage on their own.

UNICEF supported the water resources department in implementing water supply systems in the villages, where they dug wells to tap underground water sources.

For the sustainability of the water supply systems, they are handed over to the WASH committee for operation and functionality management.

We collect a minimal charge for water of 1 Nakfa per 20 litres from the community members, which is then used for the maintenance and operation of the system. --a WASH committee member

Other challenges to the smooth operation of the system were the unavailability of a skilled technician, lack of availability of spare parts locally and high cost of fuel for fuel-powered generators.

UNICEF Eritrea has started to adopt solar-powered systems as a more energy-saving and environment-friendly approach. The organization is also in discussion with government partners to ease access to spare parts hub at Zoba (regional) and sub-Zoba level.

The land that encompasses the modern-day state of Eritrea is vast and old. The country itself, however, is one of the youngest countries on the African continent. After winning its independence from neighboring Ethiopia in a 30-year-long war of liberation, Eritrea emerged on the world stage as an underdeveloped and rural nation. While Eritrea has dealt with more than its fair share of struggles in its first 30 years of independence, sanitation and water usage continue to challenge communities. Many consider sanitation to be a gateway to development and modernization, and subsequently, Eritrea is taking steps to address this rising national issue. Here are nine facts about sanitation in Eritrea.

9 Facts About Sanitation in Eritrea

As of June 2019, Eritreans have received encouragement to ration water, reduce flushing and prepare for more drastic water limitations. This reactionary measure was in response to the nationwide water shortages that mismanagement and intense drought caused. Most Eritreans live in rural or semi-rural areas where seasonal rivers run dry for most of the summer. They rely on wells and government-supplied tankers for their daily water. As these water supplies dwindle, the rural inhabitants often do not have a reliable water source. Some people have even begun to migrate to different areas of the country in search of new water sources. Community-led endeavors make up most of the efforts currently combating a lack of sanitation in Eritrea. In late 2007, the Eritrean government adopted a new initiative called Community-Led Total Sanitation (CLTS). Through this program, villages appointed hygiene promoters to assess the sanitation needs of approximately 20 homes and advocate for new community measures. One significant breakthrough came when the 2008 pilot village of Adi Habteslus achieved 100% of households having and using a toilet, after the implementation of CLTS in 2007. A conference on community-led sanitation in December 2018 established an initiative to end open defecation by 2022. Thus far, the results have been promising, with a total of 163 villages declared open-defecation-free. This translates to around 135,109 people across Eritrea gaining access to established latrines. This progress is due in part to the widespread initiative of the Ministry of Health to establish CLTS in communities across Eritrea, not just in villages in close proximity to the capital. Community-implemented fines have had a positive impact on community health. For example, in late 2019 the U.N. volunteers reported that after implementing a penalty of 100 Nfk (equivalent to $7) for open defecation, a village in Anseba is now reporting “a significant decrease in the diarrheal diseases.” Today, Eritrea is still on track to meet the goal of declaring an open-defecation-free state by 2022, thanks in part to the continued success of CLTS. Community activists are also organizing the construction of latrines at their own cost to promote cleaner sanitation habits. In a program meant to reduce and even eliminate open defecation, many rural Eritreans are constructing communal latrines without any subsidies and using locally available materials. One woman, Amna Abdela Mussa, age 45 from the Emberemi Village, benefited greatly after constructing her own latrine, saying that it was empowering to give back to her community and improve her own sanitation. Poor sanitation in Eritrea disproportionately impacts women and girls. It is a long-standing cultural expectation that women and girls in rural and urban Eritrea are responsible for overseeing the water collection and usage in each household. As the main users of water, women have also been playing a decisive role in the planning, implementation and operation of sanitation projects. Yirgalem Solomon is one of these women. She is currently spearheading a project to introduce an open dialogue in Eritrean middle schools about menstruation and sanitation to “break the taboo and help the girls address the many challenges they face.” Waste disposal still proves to be a difficult issue to manage, as many rural areas have no sanitary facilities. Open defecation is not the only cause of this. Additionally, latrines without proper sewage allow human waste to go back into the soil. This, combined with flash flooding that deforestation and mismanaged agricultural practices intensified, increases the chance of water pollution and eutrophication. Unfortunately, there are no large-scale projects yet to oversee the development of sanitation facilities. Consistent infrastructure, like the Khashm el-Girba Dam, is in jeopardy in response to water shortages. Many rivers in Eritrea are seasonal, however, the Setit River flows all year and forms a small reservoir at the base of the Khashm el-Girba Dam. Through proper irrigation, the dam allowed for steady water supply until recently. Due to the prolonged drought, there are more than 500,000 people seeking shelter in refugee camps neighboring the dam. This influx of improper usage is making it difficult to keep the water clean. Japan is collaborating with the Eritrean government to lessen the effects of the drought. The small town of Dbarwa proved to be a valuable example of this outreach. The drought heavily impacted this rural community and caused it to lose all assurance of well- and tanker- supplied water. However, the Japan International Cooperation Agency assisted in drilling five boreholes for the town, providing water to almost 30,000 inhabitants. The most effective way to ensure a path towards equal sanitation is to promote sustainable habits that keep water clean and available. Current projections estimate a temperature increase of 46.4 degrees Fahrenheit (8 degrees Celsius) by 2050 and increasing variability in rainfall, making clean water more difficult to obtain. Eritrea is trying to combat this through the United Nations Development Program (UNDP). This program has already led to advancements in irrigation and soil erosion reduction through an emphasis on the adaptive capacity to climate change.

These nine facts about sanitation in Eritrea provide a glimpse into the current modernization techniques that the country is pursuing. While Eritrea still has plenty of work to do, thanks to the participation of rural and urban communities alike, sanitation across the country is increasing both in quality and reach.

One in three people, or 2.4 billion of the world’s population, don’t have access to sanitation facilities. This number equates to about 946 million people who still defecate in the open. Health problems intermix with poverty to create havoc in some of the poorest regions of the world, and such circumstances become prevalent with sanitation in Eritrea, Africa.

Eritrea

The World Health Organization reports that Eritrea remains one of the poorest countries in Africa. The country has experienced independence from Ethiopia for only 16 years, and with this separation comes some developmental setbacks.

In 2018, 66 percent of the population lives below the poverty line, and there remains an extreme lack of resources and poverty alleviation programs.

State of Sanitation

In 2008, Community Led Total Sanitation (CLTS) was adopted by the government of Eritrea. The goal of the program was to end open defecation — a practice that leads to a variety of health concerns such as diarrhea, intestinal worms, typhoid, cholera, hepatitis and polio trachoma. To be open-defecation-free, each household in a community or village must have their own latrine.

In 2010, only 3.5 percent of the rural population of the country had access to a latrine. This meant that over 96 percent of the population continued to practice dangerous hygiene, including open defecation. UNICEF, along with the Ministry of Health, devised a plan to help aid the country’s poorest gain proper sanitation in Eritrea.

Program Design for Proper Sanitation in Eritrea

Education and communication were the program’s two objectives in the effort to disperse proper sanitation in Eritrea. To do this, they first had to alter the taboo tied to talking about the bathroom and toilets.

Additionally, the design took into consideration the Millennium Development Goal of 2015 to have 54 percent of people able to access proper sanitation.

The program evaluated the country by six regions, or zobas, in which reside nine ethnic groups of indigenous people. To best address the concerns of each region, a case study was performed within each ethnic group to discover the specific morals and barriers in accessing sanitation.

In 2012, 52.8 percent of the population within these regions used unimproved water sources, which includes unprotected public wells or rivers and streams. Additionally, sanitation access was scarce, with only 47.3 percent having access to a latrine; in fact, over 75 percent of the rural population defecated in the open.

Tigrinya

The Tigrinya is the largest ethnic group in the country and makes up 55 percent of the population. In 2012, Knowledge, Attitude and Practice (KAP) surveyed the area on hygiene and sanitation and identified a variety of barriers in the group’s understanding of hygiene.

Firstly, the scarcity of water was a huge problem in the area. Not only did humans share water sources with animals, but also problems of distance and protection of wells raised health concerns regarding sanitation in Eritrea.

Culturally, Tigrinyan people felt that water was holy. As a result, most people felt there was no need to boil water before consumption; however, water can carry bacteria that can lead to such illnesses as schistosomiasis, giardiasis, diarrhea, abdominal cramps and vomiting.

Effective Social Support

To combat cultural and physical barriers within this group, UNICEF designed a plan specific to Tigrinyan. For instance, people were concerned that wood latrines would collapse if they used them, and thus preferred stone latrines.

However, stone materials are difficult to transport, so UNICEF educated the Village Health Committee on how to properly construct the latrines so there would be no chance of collapse. This social support provides the proper knowledge and motivation to follow through with the construction of latrines and sanitation facilities.

Successes

In 2015, almost 600 villages in Eritrea achieved open-defecation-free-status. This statistic represents 30 percent of the rural population of Eritrea — 586,000 people — who now have access to proper sanitation.

Additionally, since the adoption of CLTS the child mortality rate for children under five has dropped. In 2008, the inaugural year of the program, the child mortality rate was 89 percent. The World Bank reports in 2016 that the rate has dropped to 45 percent.

Although the progress is below the MDG of 54 percent with access to improved access by 2015, there have been significant strides in ending preventable diseases from improper sanitation in Eritrea.

621,https://reliefweb.int/report/eritrea/community-led-sanitation-brings-great-promise-eritrea,Community-led sanitation brings great promise for Eritrea - Eritrea,"MBEREMI, Eritrea, 31 December 2009 - Encouraging communities to work to improve their health and hygiene means empowering people with the right messages and the means to improve their sanitation systems.

In Eritrea, the remote Emberemi village is located in the midst of a powdery pulp of sand. On a typical homestead there are a few houses, a little kraal with cows tethered to wooden posts, and on the corner is a toilet, also constructed of local shrubs.

Harsh living conditions don't trouble the villagers, but were noticeable to a visiting team from UNICEF and the Ministry of Health, who arrived to monitor the community-led total sanitation strategy (CLTS).

A project with promise

CLTS is a revolutionary low-cost approach to rural sanitation where communities are facilitated to assess their own sanitation situation, analyze and take action to stop open defecation and build their own latrines without any subsidy and using locally available materials. In 2010, the Ministry of Health, with the support of UNICEF, plans to enable the 60,000 households countrywide to stop open defecation.

According to the latest estimates, only five per cent of Eritrea's population has access to improved sanitation facilities. The CLTS project bears great promise and could position the country towards achieving the MDG target on sanitation.

Better toilets, better hygiene

The household of villager Amna Abdela Mussa, age 45, was the first to be visited. She paused from her laundry to welcome the team and show them her toilet. ""I heard the message from Ministry of Health on the importance of sanitation and I took it upon myself to construct my own toilet,"" she said.

The toilet also serves as a bathroom and has two off-site pits. On one side is the toilet and on the other side is the seat for bathing and a pit for dirty water. To ensure good hygiene, a small jerry can is positioned at the door. It is tied to a wooden post, with a rope extending from its mouth to a small peg on the ground. The idea behind this is that one does not have to touch the jerry can, but on stepping on the rope, it automatically tilts the jerry can downwards to enable hand washing. A bar of soap is positioned next to it.

Ms. Mussa is just one of the many Eritreans who have enthusiastically embraced the CLTS. In 2008, one village was declared and certified to be open defecation free (ODF). In 2009, a momentous community mobilization initiative geared towards collective behaviour change to give up open defecation and take up safe hygiene practices took off, with a total of 11,000 households having stopped open defecation and 11 villages now ODF.

Partnerships for shared success

The momentum gained in sanitation has been made possible through funding from the United Kingdom's Department for International Development. According to UNICEF's Chief of Water and Sanitation in Eritrea David Proudfoot, this partnership is key and progress depends very much on sustained funding for the project.

""If we are to sustain results and build on the momentum, this funding must continue, it will position Eritrea on the path to achieving the Millennium Development Goal on sanitation,"" Mr. Proudfoot said.

It is estimated that approximately 448,000 Eritrean households in rural areas need to build and use their own toilet in order to meet the MDG target by 2015. One of the pioneers of the CLTS, Dr. Kamal Kar believes that this target is very much achievable.

""Eritrea has great potential to serve as an example to the world given the commitment of the government,"" Dr. Kar said.","In 2010, the Ministry of Health, with the support of UNICEF, plans to enable the 60,000 households countrywide to stop open defecation.

degree of risk: high food or waterborne diseases: bacterial diarrhea, hepatitis A, and typhoid fever vectorborne diseases: malaria and dengue fever

Definition: This entry lists major infectious diseases likely to be encountered in countries where the risk of such diseases is assessed to be very high as compared to the United States. These infectious diseases represent risks to US government personnel traveling to the specified country for a period of less than three years. The degree of risk is assessed by considering the foreign nature of these infectious diseases, their severity, and the probability of being affected by the diseases present. The diseases listed do not necessarily represent the total disease burden experienced by the local population.

The risk to an individual traveler varies considerably by the specific location, visit duration, type of activities, type of accommodations, time of year, and other factors. Consultation with a travel medicine physician is needed to evaluate individual risk and recommend appropriate preventive measures such as vaccines.

Diseases are organized into the following six exposure categories shown in italics and listed in typical descending order of risk. Note: The sequence of exposure categories listed in individual country entries may vary according to local conditions.

food or waterborne diseases acquired through eating or drinking on the local economy:

Hepatitis A - viral disease that interferes with the functioning of the liver; spread through consumption of food or water contaminated with fecal matter, principally in areas of poor sanitation; victims exhibit fever, jaundice, and diarrhea; 15% of victims will experience prolonged symptoms over 6-9 months; vaccine available.

Hepatitis E - water-borne viral disease that interferes with the functioning of the liver; most commonly spread through fecal contamination of drinking water; victims exhibit jaundice, fatigue, abdominal pain, and dark colored urine.

Typhoid fever - bacterial disease spread through contact with food or water contaminated by fecal matter or sewage; victims exhibit sustained high fevers; left untreated, mortality rates can reach 20%.

vectorborne diseases acquired through the bite of an infected arthropod:

Malaria - caused by single-cell parasitic protozoa Plasmodium; transmitted to humans via the bite of the female Anopheles mosquito; parasites multiply in the liver attacking red blood cells resulting in cycles of fever, chills, and sweats accompanied by anemia; death due to damage to vital organs and interruption of blood supply to the brain; endemic in 100, mostly tropical, countries with 90% of cases and the majority of 1.5-2.5 million estimated annual deaths occurring in sub-Saharan Africa.

Dengue fever - mosquito-borne (Aedes aegypti) viral disease associated with urban environments; manifests as sudden onset of fever and severe headache; occasionally produces shock and hemorrhage leading to death in 5% of cases.

Yellow fever - mosquito-borne viral disease; severity ranges from influenza-like symptoms to severe hepatitis and hemorrhagic fever; occurs only in tropical South America and sub-Saharan Africa, where most cases are reported; fatality rate is less than 20%.

Japanese Encephalitis - mosquito-borne (Culex tritaeniorhynchus) viral disease associated with rural areas in Asia; acute encephalitis can progress to paralysis, coma, and death; fatality rates 30%.

African Trypanosomiasis - caused by the parasitic protozoa Trypanosoma; transmitted to humans via the bite of bloodsucking Tsetse flies; infection leads to malaise and irregular fevers and, in advanced cases when the parasites invade the central nervous system, coma and death; endemic in 36 countries of sub-Saharan Africa; cattle and wild animals act as reservoir hosts for the parasites.

Cutaneous Leishmaniasis - caused by the parasitic protozoa leishmania; transmitted to humans via the bite of sandflies; results in skin lesions that may become chronic; endemic in 88 countries; 90% of cases occur in Iran, Afghanistan, Syria, Saudi Arabia, Brazil, and Peru; wild and domesticated animals as well as humans can act as reservoirs of infection.

Plague - bacterial disease transmitted by fleas normally associated with rats; person-to-person airborne transmission also possible; recent plague epidemics occurred in areas of Asia, Africa, and South America associated with rural areas or small towns and villages; manifests as fever, headache, and painfully swollen lymph nodes; disease progresses rapidly and without antibiotic treatment leads to pneumonic form with a death rate in excess of 50%.

Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever - tick-borne viral disease; infection may also result from exposure to infected animal blood or tissue; geographic distribution includes Africa, Asia, the Middle East, and Eastern Europe; sudden onset of fever, headache, and muscle aches followed by hemorrhaging in the bowels, urine, nose, and gums; mortality rate is approximately 30%.

Rift Valley fever - viral disease affecting domesticated animals and humans; transmission is by mosquito and other biting insects; infection may also occur through handling of infected meat or contact with blood; geographic distribution includes eastern and southern Africa where cattle and sheep are raised; symptoms are generally mild with fever and some liver abnormalities, but the disease may progress to hemorrhagic fever, encephalitis, or ocular disease; fatality rates are low at about 1% of cases.

Chikungunya - mosquito-borne (Aedes aegypti) viral disease associated with urban environments, similar to Dengue Fever; characterized by sudden onset of fever, rash, and severe joint pain usually lasting 3-7 days, some cases result in persistent arthritis.

water contact diseases acquired through swimming or wading in freshwater lakes, streams, and rivers:

Leptospirosis - bacterial disease that affects animals and humans; infection occurs through contact with water, food, or soil contaminated by animal urine; symptoms include high fever, severe headache, vomiting, jaundice, and diarrhea; untreated, the disease can result in kidney damage, liver failure, meningitis, or respiratory distress; fatality rates are low but left untreated recovery can take months.

Schistosomiasis - caused by parasitic trematode flatworm Schistosoma; fresh water snails act as intermediate host and release larval form of parasite that penetrates the skin of people exposed to contaminated water; worms mature and reproduce in the blood vessels, liver, kidneys, and intestines releasing eggs, which become trapped in tissues triggering an immune response; may manifest as either urinary or intestinal disease resulting in decreased work or learning capacity; mortality, while generally low, may occur in advanced cases usually due to bladder cancer; endemic in 74 developing countries with 80% of infected people living in sub-Saharan Africa; humans act as the reservoir for this parasite.

aerosolized dust or soil contact disease acquired through inhalation of aerosols contaminated with rodent urine:

Lassa fever - viral disease carried by rats of the genus Mastomys; endemic in portions of West Africa; infection occurs through direct contact with or consumption of food contaminated by rodent urine or fecal matter containing virus particles; fatality rate can reach 50% in epidemic outbreaks.

respiratory disease acquired through close contact with an infectious person:

Meningococcal meningitis - bacterial disease causing an inflammation of the lining of the brain and spinal cord; one of the most important bacterial pathogens is Neisseria meningitidis because of its potential to cause epidemics; symptoms include stiff neck, high fever, headaches, and vomiting; bacteria are transmitted from person to person by respiratory droplets and facilitated by close and prolonged contact resulting from crowded living conditions, often with a seasonal distribution; death occurs in 5-15% of cases, typically within 24-48 hours of onset of symptoms; highest burden of meningococcal disease occurs in the hyperendemic region of sub-Saharan Africa known as the ""Meningitis Belt"" which stretches from Senegal east to Ethiopia.

animal contact disease acquired through direct contact with local animals:

Rabies - viral disease of mammals usually transmitted through the bite of an infected animal, most commonly dogs; virus affects the central nervous system causing brain alteration and death; symptoms initially are non-specific fever and headache progressing to neurological symptoms; death occurs within days of the onset of symptoms.

624,https://www.tesfanews.net/three-advantages-of-the-eritrean-water-dam-network/,Three Advantages of the Eritrean Water Dam Network,"BY MELA GHEBREMEDHIN*

This article was published on the issue of Hommes D’Afrique Magazine on March 2017. The well-known magazine which circulates in Morocco, has took focus on water development in Eritrea. The original article entitled, Trois Avantages du Réseau de Barrages d’Eau Erythréens, was written in its 94th Edition.

Human beings can live and, even, live well without petroleum or diamond. Without water, which constitutes more than 70% of human body, human beings die. As other natural resources, water is unequally shared among countries. Some have it in abundance while others have very little. As a country located in semi-arid region, Eritrea is experimenting with an original solution to solve the issue of water access. How does it do it?







Eritrea has little water reserves, 548 cubic meter per inhabitant. It’s equivalent to 7.3 times less than the average for Sub-Saharan Africa and 90 times lesser than the amount of water resources available per inhabitant living in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

Moreover, the annual rainfall of Eritrea is low. The rare regions record better rainfall, about 1000mm of rain fall annually. Conversely, major parts of the country register less than 300mm.

A comparison with a city such as Duala in Cameroon where each year rain drops on average at 3,900mm shows the significance of the difficulty Eritreans face.

Aware of the constraints in access to water imposed on the population, the Eritrean authorities put in place a water policy which has led to bear fruits. At the heart of this policy is the construction of large, small and micro water dams, which conserve every drop of water and constitute a sort of network of artificial lakes with multiple functions.

The most important goal of those constructions is the agricultural irrigation. According to the 2016 edition of The Little Green Data Book, published by the World Bank, in Eritrea, agriculture consumes about 95% of the country’s water resources.

Desperate to come out of its precarious situation in which the country was swamped by decades of war, natural hazards and a difficult climate, the Government of Eritrea made agriculture its top development priority. Water is the number one ingredient of success in agriculture. The ongoing building of a network of water dams in Eritrea is, thus, an investment where its long term value cannot be underestimated.







As the mining policy of Eritrea that has introduced in the January 2017 edition of Hommes d’Afrique, the network of Eritrean water dams can serve as a model to many African countries for the following reasons:

First of all, the variety in the sizes of the water dams. Indeed, often in Africa, immense water dams are constructed which become “white elephants” and destroy small-scale farmers and micro water dams used for local farming and the local economy.

Secondly, the so-called “Local Content”. In Africa, 99% of the time building up large and mega water dams means giving the job and the human resources to non-African enterprises. From its feasibility study to its operations and maintenance, the foreigner will be the master of the project. He will come with his know-how and will not share it with the local professionals. Things are going differently in Eritrea with the building of small and micro water dams.

The third point which makes the Eritrean system of water dams attractive is tourism. Water dams add a beautiful touristic touch to the Eritrean landscape which is quite special.

Often, Africans look out of their continent for models to emulate. There is nothing bad in being open-minded and in looking for enriching experiences. However, if this search for models turns only into one direction, it may be destructive. Instead of always looking out the window, one has to also see what is inside the home.

Africans, it’s time to reclaim confidence in yourselves. Your continent is diverse. This diversity generates multiple experiences. Some fail and some succeed. An intra-African bench marking would allow African countries to share experiences. Without doubt, the system of water dams of Eritrea is a case in point.

to the end of World War II, after which Italian colonization

was replaced by the British Empi re. In 1951, due to U.S.

strategic interest in the region, the U.N. federated Eritrea with

the Ethiopian Empire and the country became the battle

ground for Eritrean struggle for independence. In 1991 after

thirty years of bloody war that practically destroyed all

economic activities and infrastructu re of the country, Eritrea

won the war and declared its political independence and since

it is struggling to achieve its economic independence facing

several challenges [5].

Eritreans have one of the world's lowest e nergy production

and consumption rates. According to World Bank data,

Electrical production in Eritrea is about 300 Mega Watt in

2010 which is one of the lowest in Africa and the per capita

gross electrical power consum ption in Eritrea for the same

period reported about 50 kW-hr/year is also the lowest in

Africa. Commercial energy c onsumption in other de veloping

countries is much higher [6].

As a young independent country Eritrea is not endowed

with natural perennial rivers that can be used as sources of

hydro electricity generation, as the case for many nations, nor

does it have hydrocarbon resources like coal , oil or natural

gas that can be exploited to ge nerate cheap electrical power.

Even though there were and may still be exploration of

hydrocarbon resources in Eritrea, they have not yet

materialized [7]. Therefore energy and water are not

sufficiently available in the country and because of these

facts Eritrea’s economic developm ent drive can be hampered

both in the short and long run.

II. L ITERATURE R EVIEW

There are several locations around the w orld where land

sinks below sea level. There ar e three particular sites in

Africa and one in the Middle East that allow for the

possibility of high capacity hydroelectric generation

capacities operating between the sea and a depression that is

below sea level: 1) The Danakil Depression in Eritrea,

Ethiopia, 2) the Qattara depr ession in Egypt, 3) Lake Assal

and the surrounding Afar depression area in Dj ibouti, and 4)

the Dead Sea Depression between Jordan and Israel border.

The idea of using the sea as a source of hydroelectric

power is not new. There are examples from other depression

localities close to the Red Sea. The one which is currently

actively pursued is called The Jordanian-Israeli “peace

canal,” or Red-Dead Canal Proj ect, which aims to save the

Dead Sea from drying up.

The Dead Sea lies between th e Jordanian-Israeli border

and is vital for tourism and natural resources. The would-be

canal would extend 180 km (112 m iles) from the Gulf of

Aqaba in the Red Sea to the Dead Sea. The plan calls for

electricity generation and a larg e seawater desalination plan

that would produce as much as 850million c ubic meters

[2,788 million cubic feet] of potable water for people in the

West Bank. In 2005, the governments of the three countries

surrounding the Dead Sea – Is rael, Jordan and the Palestinian

Territories – agreed on a way to halt the sea’s declin e. The

proposed solution entails buil ding a 180 km canal and tunnel

system to transfer water from the Red Sea to the Dead S ea.

The three parties asked the World Bank to oversee the

implementation of a feasibility study and environmental and

social assessment for the proj ect in accordance with the

Bank’s policies and guidelines. The feasibility study for the

project is expected to take about 2 years and will cost 15.5

million USD. The study is to be financed through a

multi-donor trust fund, and the project itself could cost as

much as 5 billion USD and may take up to 20 years to

complete [8].

The other attempt was the Qattara Depression Project [9].

The large size of the Qattara Depr ession and the fact that it

falls to a depth of 133 m below mean sea level has led t o

several proposals to create a massive hydroelectric project in

northern Egypt rivaling the Aswan High Dam. This project

was known as the Qattara Depression Project. The proposals

call for a large canal or tunnel being excavated from the

Qattara due north of 55 to 80 kilometers to the Mediterranean

Sea to bring seawater into the area. Water would flo w into a

series of hydro-electric penstocks which would generate

electricity by releasing the wa ter at 60 m below sea level.

However the project has never been undertaken. Compared to

the two depression sites, the Red Sea Da nakil Depression

hydro project would be by far the easiest to develop.

A. The Red Sea Coast and Danakil Depression:

I, along with three employees of the Eritrean Ministry of

Agriculture, visited the Red Sea coastline and the Danakil

land depression in the summer o f 2012 (Fig. 3). The coast

line on the Red Sea, from Marsa Fatima to Tio, which covers

about 90 kilometers distance along the coast of Red Sea, is a

flat land, without hills or ridges. Fig. 4 Sea water can be

channeled inland to the Danakil Depression, with little

difficulty. The topography of the land between the Red Sea

coast and the depression is mostly flat without hills making it

unnecessary to excavate tunnels to build a channel. Only a

few kilometers of access canals from the Red Sea would be

needed to access this region seawater and use it for

hydroelectric project.

Traveling westward inland from the sea coast to the

Danakil Depression, the elevation gradually slopes

downward from the sea level to 120M below sea all the way

to Kalul to the lowest elevation point in Eritrea. The distance

between the Red Sea coast and Kalul is about 70 kilometers.

The Depression covers several thousand square kilometers of

flat land and stretches into Ethiopia (Fig. 5 and Fig. 6).

A few years ago, when the river Anseba dried off during a drought spell, the same people would move from one place to another in search of pasture and water for their livestock, and the river banks would be deserted.

Now, as encouraged by the Water Action Decade launched this year on World Water Day, communities are turning to nature-based solutions to sustain their livelihoods.

In alignment with Sustainable Development Goals 6, 13, 14, and 15, the project Climate change adaptation programme in water and agriculture in the Anseba region of Eritrea works with vulnerable communities to increase their resilience to climate change through integrated water and land management.

The project was initiated in 2012 by the Government in partnership with UNDP and is financed by the Adaptation Fund.

630,https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/eritrea/overview,Eritrea Overview,"Economy

Eritrea’s recent growth performance has been marked by significant volatility in part due to its dependence on a predominantly rain-fed agriculture sector, accounting for about one-third of the economy (and which has a significant impact on distribution services which account for around 20% of gross domestic product (GDP), and on a narrow mining sector which also accounts for 20% of the economy. Real GDP growth is estimated to have recovered to around 12% in 2018, while averaging -2.7% during 2015-18 on account of frequent droughts and a decline in mining production.

Reported inflation has been negative during 2016-18, following the exchange of currency in circulation in November 2015 that resulted in a monetary contraction. Deflation continued in 2018 as increased trade with Ethiopia resulted in further put downward pressure on prices.

In recent years, Eritrea has significantly tightened fiscal policy to reverse the chronic deficits it suffered after the increase in regional insecurity in 1998. In 2018, the fiscal surplus widened to around 11% of GDP in 2018. This was largely achieved by a sharp drop in capital spending as well as some revenue measures. However, fiscal pressures, both recurrent and wage-related are likely to mount.

Short-term growth prospects remain challenging given fiscal constraints and limited opportunities under existing restrictions. The recovery in agriculture is expected to slow. The country remains in a difficult macroeconomic situation with an unsustainable debt burden (including arrears to the World Bank) and vulnerable financial and external sectors.

However, the economic outlook is potentially favorable in the medium term, reflecting the new mining operations coming on stream, but are also dependent on measures to relax restrictions on the private sector imposed and to reopen access to concessional development finance.

Poverty appears to have remained widespread in Eritrea, but the lack of data limits available quantitative evidence. The most recent available survey data from 1996/97 indicate a 70% poverty rate.

The country has seen consistent improvements in life expectancy (rising from 50 years in 1990 to 65 years in 2015) and expected years of schooling (from 3.8 years in 1995 to 5.4 years in 2010) and strong social outcomes in the face of limited resources.

Nevertheless, challenges remain. An unfinished maternal and child health agenda is compounded by a significant rise in Non-Communicable Disease (NCDs). Skilled birth attendance remains low, between 35-60%, maternal mortality ratio high at 485 deaths per 100,000 live births and under-five malnutrition also high with 52% of children underweight.

Political Background

Eritrea is small, coastal country strategically located along the Red Sea in the Horn of Africa, bordered by Sudan, Ethiopia and Djibouti. Eritrea is divided into six administrative regions called ‘zobas’, which vary in size, population and socioeconomic conditions.

After a long liberation war, Eritrea regained self-rule in 1991 and full independence in 1993. The country enjoyed seven years of stabilization, reconstruction and development, before the onset of a border war with Ethiopia in 1998. The brunt of hostilities ended in 2000 and a UN Eritrea-Ethiopia Boundary Commission (EEBC) ruled in favor of Eritrea in 2002, but the border zone remained militarized, UN Security Council sanctions were imposed in 2009 and reinforced in 2011. Eritrea remained in a state of mobilization for almost two decades under transitional political arrangements focused on national security with a suspension of traditional checks and balances. The earlier development model was eschewed in favor of greater self-reliance and a more state-led planned economy.

Management of national resources – labor, land, and finance – was geared toward maintaining a state of military readiness, alongside efforts to broaden social equity. The private sector was gradually replaced by an extensive state sector geared to marshal scarce resources and increasing restrictions were imposed. An institutional framework developed to direct labor into an indefinite military and national service. The resulting austerity and extensive controls spurred migration of people and capital.

In mid-2018, Eritrea experienced a turnaround in its external environment. Ethiopia accepted the EEBC decision and signed a peace treaty with Eritrea in July 2018. Eritrea began to normalize relations with neighboring countries. In November 2018, UN Security Council lifted its sanctions on Eritrea. This raised expectations of a reorientation of Eritrean political and economic arrangements have been met with caution from the administration, as evidenced by President Isaias’ recent call for a “patient appraisal of the unfolding reality.”

632,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/apr/17/ethiopia1,Eritrea: the forgotten famine,"Agricultural production in the key grain-producing highlands has been disrupted by a war with Ethiopia, its neighbour and former ally, while the situation has been aggravated by drought in the northern lowlands, a UN report said.

The report, prepared by the UN's children's agency, Unicef, for the weekend visit of the UN special envoy Catherine Bertini, said 850,000 Eritreans would need food aid out of a population of just 3m.

While attention has been focused on Ethiopia, where 7.7m are threatened with starvation, the World Food Programme (WFP) estimates that another 8m people are also in danger in nine other east African countries.

Ms Bertini, who heads the WFP, visited Giset, a village in northwestern Eritrea at the weekend, and said she was very disappointed with the lack of response to a WFP appeal earlier this month for £5m to feed 212,000 Eritreans.

""This is exactly the kind of situation we are talking about in much of the region,"" said Ms Bertini, who is on a week-long tour of Ethiopia, Djibouti, Eritrea and Kenya. ""These people have been able to cope until now, but their own resources have almost gone.""

The villagers of Giset have borne about three years of drought which have left them perilously short of food. But Giset's problems are not just about a lack of rain. The two-year-old border conflict with Ethiopia has magnified the villagers' problems and stretched their ability to cope to the limit.

Under normal circumstances, Eritrea's government buys surplus grain from the highlands and sells it cheaply to people of lowland villages such as Giset during the dry season. But this year, hundreds of thousands of people in the highlands have been forced from their homes because of the border war, and are now living in camps.

Tens of thousands of Eritrean nationals who have been deported from Ethiopia simply add to the mouths to feed. The surplus has disappeared.

""The people who were producing the food are now themselves reliant on food aid,"" a UN official said. The effect of the war is a sensitive subject for a country which, since independence from Ethiopia in 1993, has always prided itself on its self-reliance. Eritrea's economy, which used to depend partly on trade with Ethiopia, is also in trouble after nearly two years of war. Because of the debilitating cost of the conflict on the tiny Red sea state, the government has little money left.

""The government is not able to purchase whatever food is there, and what it does have it is using to feed people at the front,"" the UN official said. The net result of drought and the government's inability to respond is that the price of the staple food, sorghum, has doubled since August last year.","""This is exactly the kind of situation we are talking about in much of the region,"" said Ms Bertini, who is on a week-long tour of Ethiopia, Djibouti, Eritrea and Kenya.

Floods and failed rains caused by the El Nino weather phenomenon have sparked a dramatic rise in the number of people going hungry in east Africa.

But authoritarian and isolated Eritrea has long rejected UN food aid in favor of a policy of self reliance, and Isaias said he was not worried.

""In view of the harvest shortfall that has affected the whole Horn of Africa region, President Isaias stated that the country will not face any crisis in spite of reduced agricultural output,"" the information ministry said, after he was interviewed by state-run media.

Isaias praised the government's ""judicious policy and approaches of bolstering its strategic food reserves.""

In Eritrea, few if any major foreign aid agencies are allowed to operate, while the UN has limited access across the country, and most assessments are dependent on government reports.

All too often, travellers abruptly find themselves suffering from a gastrointestinal infection. This condition occurs so regularly that it merits its own name: Traveller’s Diarrhea. The culprits are bacteria, protozoa, viruses, and toxins that are transmitted through contaminated food and water, and poor hand hygiene practices.

Food and water-borne illnesses can occur in any country. When we are travelling, we are more likely to be unfamiliar with our food – we won’t always know where it came from, how it was prepared, or who handled it. Some of us are also more inclined to take risks by trying local delicacies and eating from various food vendors. You can prevent gastrointestinal infections when you know the risks, make safe choices, and practice good hygiene. The golden rule is: Boil it, Cook it, Peel it, or Forget it!

Drinking water safety

Always exercise caution with your drinking water. In areas where hygiene and sanitation are challenging to maintain, taking precautions with drinking water is essential.

Is the tap water safe?

Tap water quality and access to clean drinking water varies from region to region. The safety of the drinking water at your destination depends on context-specific factors such as the local supply and distribution system as well as the monitoring and enforcement of water quality standards.

Water quality can be affected by:

Lack of safe water storage

Old pipes or water treatment systems

Poor sanitation infrastructure

Agricultural run-off

Chemical pollutants

Human or animal waste

Weather-related events such as flooding

Even slight changes in water composition can cause Traveller’s Diarrhea. For example, tap water at your destination will have no ill effect on the local population, but due to different treatment standards there may be higher concentrations or unfamiliar strains of E.coli bacteria present. This can cause diarrhea since you do not develop immunity during short-term exposure.

How to prevent water-borne illnesses

Boil your water

If you are unsure about the tap water quality at your destination, bring the water to a rolling boil. Boiling your water destroys pathogens that can cause gastrointestinal infections such as E. coli, Giardia, and Cryptosporidium. Let your water cool in a covered container overnight and pour it into your reusable water bottle before heading out for the day.

Treated water

Water disinfection methods such as filtration, ultraviolet (UV) light and chemical disinfection can be used if there is no heating source to boil water. To learn about different treatment methods, see the following resource:

Bottled water

Bottled water is another option. However, bottles may be outdated or tampered with. Bottled water is also a large contributor to pollution and contributes to the water crisis. If you do purchase bottled water, do so from a reputable source and check that the bottle cap is properly sealed.

Food safety

Always exercise caution when eating high risk foods. Reduce your risk of illness by practicing food safety and following good hand hygiene practices at your destination.

How food becomes contaminated

Exposure to contaminated food is a common source of gastrointestinal illnesses. Before we eat our food, it encounters growers, processors, storage facilities, retailers, and food handlers that can introduce pathogens such as e. coli, Clostridium botulinum, and salmonella. Contamination can also occur through:

Washing food with untreated water

Cross-contamination of raw and cooked items

Improper cooking, storage, and refrigeration

Unsanitary cooking tools and utensils

Poor hand hygiene

How to prevent food-borne illnesses

High risk foods

Due to increased risk of contamination, travellers should practice caution with the following foods:

Undercooked or raw meat, poultry, seafood, fish, and eggs

Unpeeled fruits, vegetables and leafy greens

Unpasteurized dairy products

Foods that have been unrefrigerated or uncovered for a long time such as buffets

Furthermore, it’s not just about what you eat, it’s also important to consider where you eat. It’s not always easy to know if a restaurant or food vendor follows proper food handling and hygienic practices such as properly cleaning cutting boards and utensils, regularly washing their hands, or correctly refrigerating food. Avoid restaurants and food vendors that appear unclean or that don’t have many customers.

Hand hygiene

Hand washing is key to preventing gastrointestinal infections. Inadvertently ingesting fecal matter, protozoa eggs, bacteria or viruses by touching the mouth with dirty or improperly washed hands is a common source of illness. Always ensure that you wash your hands thoroughly before handling food and after using the bathroom.

See the following resources for more information:

Food Allergies

Travelling with a food allergy? Being prepared is important to prevent an allergic reaction or anaphylactic shock during your trip. See the following resources for more information:

Seafood and shellfish poisoning

Marine foods are a common source of food poisoning that can occur in any country due to the availability of these products (fresh or frozen) around the world. See the following resources for more information:

Lack of access to clean water and sanitation is a public health concern in South Sudan.

To ensure high quality, sustainable water quality testing, monitoring and surveillance, WHO provided mobile water quality and safety testing kits to the National Public Health Laboratory to establish water quality control testing hub within the national public health laboratory in Juba. The hub will be used to test and monitor the quality of water in order to determine the status of water quality and safety in the country. This will also help to raise the profile of water quality issues on the national development agenda and encourage the Government of South Sudan to incorporate water quality into national development goals by raising the awareness of policy-makers and practitioners both within and outside the water sector on critical linkages of water quality with other development challenges.

“Good quality of drinking water is essential for human life!”, said Mr Alex Freeman WASH Focal Person for WHO South Sudan. “It is necessary that drinking water sources should be tested regularly to know whether water is meeting the prescribed standards for drinking or not”, Mr Freeman underscored.

Clean water is vital for health and sanitation, but it is rare in and near the cities and even near some of the smaller villages. Most South Sudanese use whatever water they can find, and sometimes that water is unhealthy, at times even deadly. Currently, less than half of the population has access to safe drinking water which is also arguably exacerbated by improper human waste collection and disposal systems, both of which lead to infectious disease outbreaks. Experience from around the world shows that incidents from water-borne diseases are much higher for children living in rural settlements, compared to those in urban areas with adequate sanitation and water supply.

In South Sudan, the risk of a cholera outbreak is high because of population movement, overcrowding, inadequate hygiene and toilet facilities, limited access to sufficient and safe water, risk of food contamination and unsafe practices in handling and preparing food. Since January 2017, 16,706 cholera cases and 378 deaths (CFR 2.3%) have been reported from 24 Counties.

Contaminated drinking water may also cause Dracunculiasis, or Guinea Worm disease which can rapidly affect a water sources by just one infected person, increasing the risk of transmission to a wider population.

The demand for water increases, but its availability to the country's inhabitants continually remains low. Out of the six water treatment centre in Juba, only two are functional with limited supplies including fuel to keep the power going.

The most effective means of ensuring safe drinking water is through the use of water safety plan which effectively utilizes water quality data in planning preventive and corrective actions”, said Mr Evans Liyosi, WHO Representative a.i. for South Sudan. As part of the cholera response and in view of the requirement of preparing uniform drinking water quality monitoring protocol, WHO trained and deployed 32 health care workers to establish mobile water quality testing, monitoring and surveillance in seven high risk areas with high cholera cases. The areas include Juba, Tonj East, Kapeota East, Kapeota North, Kapeota South, Yirol East, Renk Yirol East and Mingkaman.

WHO appreciates the generous contribution of the South Sudan Humanitarian Fund in helping South Sudan’s emergency preparedness and response,” said Mr Liyosi.

WHO is committed to strengthening the national public health laboratory for regular testing and documentation.

By Nina deVries

In South Sudan, water supply and hygiene services have been deeply affected by the ongoing conflict. It’s estimated that just under half of the population has access to safe water. A newly restored water treatment plant in one town is making a real difference in people's lives.



BENTIU, South Sudan, 5 September 2017 – Imagine having to fetch water from a river every day and it taking more than an hour each time. Now imagine having to do that using a wheelchair.



This was the challenge Nyahok Yar faced every day in her town of Bentiu, in the north of South Sudan. She had to wheel herself along on a tricycle, sometimes in temperatures over 40 degrees Celsius. When the rainy season came, the journey was almost impossible.

“Sometimes during the rainy season, it was too muddy, I couldn’t move with my bike to get water and I was stuck in my house,” says Nyahok.

She had to rely on neighbours to help her get water. There were times, though, when no one was available, so she had to go out on her own in the rain where she could get stranded for hours on the road.

“Sometimes when I was stuck on the road, I used to have to stay all night because no one was helping me. I was away from my children and I was so worried, nobody was caring for them,” says Nyahok.



© UNICEF/UN075402/Kealey Mary Nyakuma Peter, 15, sits in a classroom at the Machakos Primary School, Bentiu, South Sudan. About three months ago Mary’s entire family fell ill with diarrhoea. They all recovered except for her younger sister Nyakuth, 13, who passed away. “I’m feeling so sad about what happened, it was all because of the dirty water, if the clean water was there – then she might not have become sick and passed away,” says Mary.

Unsafe water: disease and malnutrition

South Sudan’s water supply and hygiene services have been severely affected by the conflict that began in 2013. Nearly 5.1 million of the most vulnerable people in the country need access to safe water and basic sanitation facilities.

Many water pumps have been damaged because of the conflict or made dysfunctional due to a lack of repairs, as well as Bentiu’s water treatment plant.

Unsafe water put children at risk of deadly diseases. Water and sanitation related diseases are one of the leading causes of death in children under 5 years old worldwide. Every day, over 800 children under 5 die from diarrhoea linked to inadequate water, sanitation and hygiene.

Diarrhoea can prevent children from getting the nutrients they need to survive, ultimately leading to malnutrition. In South Sudan, more than 1.1 million children under 5 are estimated to be acutely malnourished, with almost 276,000 facing severe acute malnutrition, this year.

“No matter how much food a malnourished child eats, he or she will not get better if the water they are drinking is not safe,” says Manuel Fontaine, UNICEF Director of Emergency Programmes.

Malnourished children are also more vulnerable to waterborne diseases like cholera. In South Sudan, a cholera outbreak that first began in June 2016 is the most severe and protracted in the country’s history with 19,742 cases and 355 deaths as of 31 July 2017.

She says her life was difficult before the water pump near her home was rehabilitated. The mother of six used to fetch water from a river, which would take about two hours by foot.

Life changing services

In Bentiu UNICEF and partners have rehabilitated and upgraded the town's water treatment plant through an initiative funded by USAID. The water supply system is now fully operational and the plant produces about 500,000 litres per day of safe, treated water. The water is then pumped to 22 water points across the city, including schools, health facilities and communities. That includes a water pump near Nyahok.

Now it takes her only five minutes to collect water with the help of her children, making it possible for her to make the journey several times a day.

Such basic services are life changing, not just for individuals like Nyahok, but entire communities.

At Machakos Primary School in Bentiu, the school’s head teacher James Thudan Kuol says more students have begun attending school since the water stand was rehabilitated.

“Good things are happening now,” he says. “The teachers are here and the children have come, a good number of them. There is a now a feeding programme installed – all of that was possible because of clean and easy access to water.”

The Bentiu hospital is also benefitting. Giel Samuel, Chief Executive Director of the hospital, explains how clean water is crucial for treating patients, especially as the hospital is now seeing an increase of patients with illnesses such as malaria due to the rainy season.

In 2017, UNICEF has supported more than 600,000 people across South Sudan to access safe water and over 200,000 people with appropriate sanitation facilities.

The resulting displacements, climatic shocks, such as prolonged dry spells and flooding, have contributed to the lack of basic water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) services, disruptions to livelihoods, and persistent macroeconomic deterioration.

The conflict and associated economic decline have greatly eroded the local government’s ability to provide basic services to the people with women and children among the most affected.

Open defecation is persistent in 61% of settlements in the country, with an estimated 85% of the population. Only 13% of the population has access to improved sanitation, and only 41% has access to safe water.

The post-conflict era offers hope to the future of children in South Sudan. However, the resulting expected influx of returnees from neighboring countries has put pressure on the existing water points and other related facilities.

World Vision is working to address these challenges through its longstanding positive working relationships with national and local level authorities, local departments of water, and various community structures.

The interventions are being implemented in collaboration with responsible government agencies and community groups who are being supported through capacity building in relation to the management of water and sanitation and hygiene awareness, guaranteeing the sustainability of activities initiated.

640,https://reliefweb.int/report/south-sudan/less-60-south-sudanese-access-clean-water,Less than 60% of South Sudanese access clean water - South Sudan,"December 27, 2015 (JUBA) – An estimated between 50-60 per cent of the population in South Sudan, has access to an improved water source, such as a hand pump, a protected well or piped water supply, which only benefits a minority.

Sadly, however, even sections of the population with access to improved water sources often do not receive safe water while those without access to an improved water source often fetch water from rivers, ponds or open wells.

Some buy water from vendors who use trucks to supply water to their customers.

Also, only 13 per cent of Juba residents can access municipal water supplied mainly through a small piped network, boreholes and a single public water filling station on the river bank. The public system is complemented by a patchwork of small private water suppliers, which end up delivering relatively expensive and low quality water.

There are about 300 registered trucks supplying water throughout Juba city. However, the delivery of water to households has decreased by 30 per cent as fuel has become expensive following the currency devaluation.

Currently, at least 11 private filling stations pump water from the Nile which is then distributed by water trucks and bicycle vendors. Water is also produced by bottling water factories. But as fuel costs have reportedly increased, operation overheads have also gone up by around 35 per cent.

“In the rainy season, communities lack drinking water. This often results into Cholera and diseases like diarrhoea. We worry a lot about our health,” Simon Biar, who lives in the South Sudanese capital, told Sudan Tribune.

“Our people drink water from any source regardless of the safety. Most times, we collect water from river Nile which is dirty and polluted,” he adds.

Mading Cienggan, a senior engineer at the country’s urban water corporation blames the poor supply of water on low power to supply the city, use of old water filters and the increase of water supply to new areas.

The Japanese government earmarked an additional fund for the Project for Improvement of Water Supply System of Juba, with total disbursement amounting to approximately $ 40 million to address the cost increase due to the political crisis and keep the project scale as originally planned.

This project aims to improve access to safe water for people in Juba by expanding the capacity of water treatment and scaling up water distribution. In this project, Japan set up a new water treatment plant, a service reservoir, eight water tank stations and 120 water points in Juba.

By the end of September 2017, officials say, as much as 390,000 of Juba residents will have ready access to safe drinking water at home, thereby enabling people to enjoy the rights to pursue lifestyles we wish to pursue.

“This project not only fulfills the basic needs of individuals but also facilitates the healthy and productive life of women and children in the communities. Reduction of the work for fetching water will immediately emancipate women and children from labor: women will have extra hours to engage in other employment opportunities, and children, in their turns, will learn better in the newly-gained hours of studies,” said Kiya Masahiko, the Japanese ambassador to South Sudan.

“Furthermore, improved public health through the use of safe, stable water supply will decrease the morbidity from waterborne diseases such as cholera, diarrhea and typhoid”, he added.

According to the United Nations Children Fund (UNICEF), only 45 per cent of basic primary schools in South Sudan have access to safe water while a mere 17 percent have adequate sanitation facilities for both girls and boys.

“As a result of limited access to safe water and adequate sanitation, a third of the children under the age of five suffer from diarrhea,” UNICEF said in recent report.

Access to safe water, adequate sanitation and hygiene promotion are all equally important; a combination of these elements are required to maintain and improve health and dignity. To prevent the spread of water-borne diseases and help improve hygiene and sanitation standards, a number of organizations in South Sudan are working on rebuilding and rehabilitating boreholes as well as larger water points.

Several residents in the South Sudanese capital admitted that access to adequate sanitation and improved hygiene practices is challenging to achieve since it requires change in behavior, especially among those in most need.

Henry Taban, a public health specialist, says hygiene promotion programmes are not entirely about improving people’s knowledge of hygiene and health, nor is it about improved sanitation about building latrines.

“A lot more is required”, says Taban, but added that “The community engagement process is vital to ensure meaningful and sustainable behaviour change process”.

As the world marked this year’s World Toilet Day, it emerged that latrines and toilets still elude many South Sudanese with only 13 per cent of the population accessing basic sanitation and 5.6 per cent of households in South Sudan have access to improved water sources and sanitation, the country’s 2010 Household Health Survey (SHS) showed.

According to UNICEF, lack of sanitation, and particularly open defecation, contributes to the incidence of diarrhoea and to the spread of intestinal parasites, which in turn aggravates malnutrition and increases the risk of diseases like Cholera especially for children less than five years.

It is estimated that more than 34.4 per cent of all children under-five in South Sudan suffer from diarrhoeal diseases every year due to poor sanitation practices.

Use of unsafe water for drinking, food preparation, hygiene, and lack of access to sanitation facilities contribute to around 88 per cent of deaths from diarrhoea in the world’s youngest nation, the 2010 SHS observed.

“We are failing children if we cannot come up with concrete and innovative solutions on proper disposal of human waste,” says Jonathan Veitch, UNICEF’s Representative in South Sudan.

“Lack of access to clean water and sanitation impacts children’s health, safety, education and survival. And for girls and women, poor access to safe and sanitary facilities puts them at greater risk of gender-based violence,” he added.

The Millennium Development Goal target for drinking water was reportedly achieved in 2010, but, in 2015, 663 million people still lack improved drinking water sources. The world missed the sanitation target by almost 700 million people, with 2.4 billion still lacking improved sanitation facilities and 946 million practicing open defecation.

Khartoum 22nd March 2017: Across the globe, March 22 every year is set aside to celebrate progress in water towards achieving global targets and to garner more political support. This year's theme: Why waste water? Is in support of SDG 6.3 on improving water quality and reducing, treating and reusing wastewater.

Over 80 per cent of the wastewater generated globally flows back into the ecosystem without being treated or reused. According to the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme Report, 1.8 billion people use a source of drinking water that is contaminated with faeces, putting them at risk of contracting cholera, dysentery, typhoid and polio. Globally, unsafe water, poor sanitation and hygiene cause around 842,000 deaths each year. By 2050, close to 70 per cent of the world’s population will live in urban cities, compared to 50 per cent today. Currently, most cities in developing countries do not have adequate infrastructure and resources to address wastewater management in an efficient and sustainable way.

Wastewater presents an enormous resource, and such opportunity should be harnessed by countries. When safely managed, wastewater becomes an affordable and sustainable source of water, energy, nutrients and other recoverable materials. The cost of wastewater management are greatly outweighed by the benefits to human health, economic development and environmental sustainability.

In Sudan, only 68 percent of households have access to basic improved water, with disparities in access between rural and urban populations at 64 and 78 per cent respectively. There are also disparities between states, with just around a third of households having access to safe water in Red Sea, White Nile and Gedarif compared to 90 per cent access in Khartoum and the Northern States. Lack of funding, inadequate management and inadequate community participation are among the main reasons behind the system’s low functionality levels. An estimated 13 million people are still using unimproved drinking water sources.

About 32 per cent of the population is drinking contaminated water from unimproved water sources. The majority of these water sources are mainly surface water while some are groundwater sources (open wells and contaminated groundwater aquifers). Secondary sources of chemical and bacteriological contamination are seriously degrading the quality of water sources. These are mainly coming from industrial waste and domestic and commercial waste (mainly excreta, urine and grey water) which are washed into surface water bodies or injected into the groundwater aquifers. National and state level acts to prevent these pollutants exist, but need to be activated.

“For children, lack of access to safe water can be tragic”, says UNICEF Representative Abdullah Fadil. “Diarrhoeal diseases linked to unsafe drinking water, poor sanitation, or poor hygiene is one of the leading causes of malnutrition and child mortality in Sudan. With the current 68 percent access to basic improved water supply, significant investment and commitment is required from Government, donors and the private sector to achieve universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water for all”, Fadil emphasized.

UNICEF is working with the government and other key partners to support increased access to basic improved water supply for communities, IDP camps, and schools, with a focus on women and children. By the end of 2016 UNICEF and partners have succeeded in the provision of lifesaving improved water supply for over almost 2,000,000 vulnerable people in emergency and unserved rural areas including internally displaced persons, South Sudanese refugees and population affected by or at risk to Acute Watery Diarrhoea (AWD) population through operation, maintenance and water chlorination services for their water sources at community and household levels.

UNICEF Sudan Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) projects are supported by UK AID, KoiCA, Government of Japan, KfW (Germany), CERF, SHF, OFDA, Switzerland Development Cooperation, Qatar (UN Darfur) and Canada.

642,https://www.neareast.org/improving-access-to-water-sanitation-and-hygiene-in-sudan/,Improving Access to clean water in Sudan,"Despite being one of the most difficult places in the world to operate as an NGO, NEF has been working in Sudan for over thirty years. As one of the few continuously operating NGOs in the country, NEF is seeing much needed progress in Sudan and making important contributions in some of the most challenging areas.

Sudan’s South Kordofan and Darfur regions have seen ongoing conflict and disruption, resulting in more than three million people who are considered internally displaced. Families have had to flee their homes due to conflict and violence, with devastating consequences for both their health and livelihoods as well as for the local populations in the areas where they have resettled. This has manifested in heightened food insecurity, inadequate access to clean water, deteriorating sanitation and hygiene conditions, and diminished opportunities for sustainable livelihoods.

NEF is working to improve hygiene, sanitation, and the water supply conditions in three clusters in South Kordofan and 12 clusters in Central Darfur. Its work there focuses on the health and well being of conflict-affected people by improving access to potable water and adequate sanitation and hygiene.

NEF is similarly working with local organizations to increase their technical and management capacity to improve access to water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) as well as increase their ability to address management of their natural resources. By improving the effectiveness of these civil society organizations in the region, it allows them to access, prioritize, communicate, and coordinate local needs of vulnerable groups with regard to WASH and natural resource management.

As a result of a trainer of trainers workshop on WASH and natural resource management in August 2016 in Rongataz, Azoum Locality, a group of four young men who live in an internally displaced persons (IDP) camp submitted a complete project proposal to NEF’s partners at the Sudanese Organisation for Humanitarian Assistance (SOHA) related to WASH and health promotion in their area.

“We live in an IDP camp and we have seen how people suffer from the lack of latrines in their homes, and how this issue has led to so many problems related to people’s health, such the prevalence of diarrhea and other hygiene related diseases,” one of the applicants stated. “So we prepared this proposal. Thank God this project and workshop came at the right time, addressing our exact need to solve one of the biggest problems that we are suffering from.”

The training workshop team received the proposal so that it can be reviewed and assessed; after which, SOHA will respond to the group.

“I have benefited a lot from this workshop and it has inspired me to work hard in our area to try to solve the problem, by conveying what I have learned in this workshop to the community to raise their awareness, especially in the IDP camps,” said another participant.

To facilitate the peaceful sharing of natural resources among ethnically diverse communities in the region, NEF has introduced new tools—such as “supra-village” associations (representative organizations to manage local resources), local conventions, and land use management plans. These tools help communities work to share much needed resources more effectively and promote inclusive and collaborative economic development. This work leverages a collaborative approach with targeted communities to complete village surveys and asset-mapping, in preparation for training and capacity building exercises in each community.

NEF also promotes peaceful and participatory economic recovery among internally displaced, returnees, and vulnerable populations in Sudan through microenterprise development and income-generating activities. In South Kordofan, non-wood forest products and natural resource management development focused on women has the potential to increase women’s income by 40 to 100 percent, improve climate-resilient food systems, and promote gender equality. NEF is working with women in South Kordofan to develop women’s cooperative associations that support women’s involvement in the cultivation and economic benefit of forest products such as gum Arabic and honey. In the first few months since the project has launched, NEF has organized nearly 500 people around these activities, over 80 percent of them women.

NEF’s work in Sudan is funded by the United States Agency for International Development’s Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA), EuropeAID, and Comic Relief.

Nearly one million people in South Sudan have been affected by heavy flooding, according to the United Nations.

Severe floods have devastated large areas of the country since July, submerging entire communities and forced hundreds of thousands from their homes, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said in a statement on Friday.

It added that an estimated 908,000 people were affected, including internally displaced people, refugees and their host communities in a country already hit by years of ruinous civil war that caused mass displacement and wrecked its economy.

The situation was “extremely concerning”, as rains are likely to continue for another four to six weeks and put more people at risk, said Alain Noudeho, OCHA humanitarian coordinator in South Sudan.

The floods have limited access to health facilities, nutrition centres, basic services and markets, according to OCHA.

Across the 32 flooded counties in Jonglei, Upper Nile, Warrap, Eastern Equatoria, Northern Bahr el Ghazal, Unity and Lakes, more than three million people were in need of assistance even before the rains, it said.

Abnormally heavy flooding has been devastating large areas of #SouthSudan since July, with 900K people affected.

See press release ➡️ https://t.co/PzfvZDsBec pic.twitter.com/rP8CZl0xpe — OCHA South Sudan (@OCHASouthSudan) October 25, 2019

Many affected areas were already facing high humanitarian needs before the flooding started, with more than 60 percent of them classified as having extreme levels of acute malnutrition.

In addition, the crisis will not be over when the water levels recede because considerable damage to crops, arable land and livestock is anticipated, the UN warned. This will obstruct the ability of families to support themselves for months to come, it added.

Despite its richness in oil, South Sudan is among the world’s poorest nations.

The country secured independence from north Sudan in 2011 after decades of war but descended into its own conflict at the end of 2013.

Under pressure from regional and international powers, the warring sides signed a peace accord in September 2018 but its rollout has been delayed.","Heavy flooding since July has submerged entire communities and forced hundreds of thousands from their homes, OCHA says.

Aid groups are racing to provide support to almost one million South Sudanese in need of lifesaving assistance after abnormally heavy rains that began in July plunged large swathes of the country under water.

Earlier this month, photojournalist Alex McBride travelled to the eastern town of Pibor – one of the worst affected areas, where health centres are submerged, communities are crammed together on higher ground, and the water shows no signs of receding.

Only small helicopters are currently able to land on the town’s flooded runway, which is hampering relief efforts, while a lack of dry land elsewhere is making it hard to assist the roughly 140,000 people who live in the wider area.

Pibor sits on a layer of what is known as black cotton soil, which struggles to absorb heavy rainfall and relies upon the heat of the sun to evaporate it.

“The soil is not absorbing the water; there’s no space for storage, no capacity to put more than six specialised staff on the ground at one time,” said Maria Teresa de Magalhaes, an emergency coordinator with medical charity Médecins Sans Frontières.

“There used to be very good water from the tap… now we have to drink dirty water.”

An estimated 420,000 people across South Sudan have been displaced by the floods – driven by a weather phenomenon called the Indian Ocean Dipole – and roughly 40,000 acres of cropland were destroyed, just as the farming season was about to begin, the World Food Programme said.

Heavy rainfall and flooding has also affected several other East African countries including Ethiopia, Kenya, and Somalia, where 370,000 people are displaced after two rivers burst their banks.

On a visit to Pibor last week, the UN’s humanitarian coordinator, Alain Noudéhou, said more than $60 million would be required to save lives across the country and protect the fragile humanitarian gains made over the course of a year-long ceasefire from South Sudan’s civil war.

For now, 10,000 households in Pibor have escaped onto small patches of dry land, where the ground is slightly higher than the surrounding flat landscape. Man-made mud walls are all that separates these remaining dry areas from the floodwater.

Some 2,700 individuals are living in makeshift shelters on one of the dry areas, MSF said. The 300-square-metre area, once an open space used for public meetings and celebrations, has just one functioning borehole for those displaced.

A healthcare centre run by MSF – accessed by The New Humanitarian by boat – has been totally submerged. Tents, vehicles, and buildings that once housed an operating theatre and a medical storage room are all under water. Rowboats are now the only way to move around.

In the village of Gumuruk, a 15-minute helicopter ride from Pibor, an elderly woman, Joung Maze, stood shin-deep in water outside her home explaining that she’d heard stories about intense flooding from her father but never seen it in person.

“Everything and everywhere is covered with water; we cannot access a better place,” she said. “There used to be very good water from the tap… now we have to drink dirty water.”

South Sudanese President Salva Kiir declared a state of national emergency last month, but David Yau Yau, the governor of Pibor, said the national government “has not yet taken any initiative towards this situation”.

The floods come at a delicate moment for the country. Last week President Kiir and opposition leader Riek Machar agreed to delay the formation of a unity government by 100 days, after missing a 12 November deadline.

The two sides signed a peace deal in September 2018 after five years of civil war but have been unable to finalise negotiations on core elements of the agreement such as the formation of a unified army.

The U.N.’s World Food Programme (WFP) said it needed $270 million urgently to provide food to hungry South Sudanese in the first half of 2020 and avert mass starvation in the world’s youngest country.

“Every factor is in place for there to be famine in 2020 unless we take immediate action to expand our deliveries in areas affected by floods and other areas affected by food loss,” Matthew Hollingworth, WFP country director, told Reuters.

“We need to pre-position food around the country in the next two to three months,” he said, noting that road access to many remote communities would be impossible after the rainy season sets in.

The government declared a state of emergency in late October in Bahr El Ghazal, Greater Upper Nile and Greater Equatoria after months of flooding, WFP said in a statement.

Nearly 1 million people are directly affected by the floods and the waters have not receded in many places, it said.

“The scale of the loss from the harvest is enormous,” Hollingworth said, speaking by telephone from Juba.

Fields with 73,000 tonnes of sorghum, millet and corn have been lost as well as tens of thousands of cattle, chickens and goats on which families depended for survival, he said.

Acute malnutrition rates in children under the age of five have risen from 13% in 2018 to 16% this year, Hollingworth said, adding: “They have gone above the global emergency threshold of 15%.”

Water-borne diseases are spreading, although no cholera has been detected, he said.

“It can only get worse because of the situation and environment people are living in,” he said.

Civil war broke out in oil-producing South Sudan in 2013, less than two years after the country gained independence from Sudan following decades of war. The conflict that has killed an estimated 400,000 people and forced millions from their homes.

Inter-communal fighting still occurs in pockets hit by the flooding, Hollingworth said.

650,https://reliefweb.int/report/south-sudan/drought-and-conflict-leave-87-million-people-hungry-somalia-and-south-sudan,Drought and conflict leave 8.7 million people hungry in Somalia and South Sudan - South Sudan,"New York, NY, July 31, 2019 — Severe drought and ongoing violence in East Africa has put 8.7 million people in Somalia and South Sudan at risk of severe food insecurity. The International Rescue Committee (IRC) is calling for early action and increased support to avert famine, especially in South Sudan and Somalia. The failure of the long rains in Somalia and impact of the war in South Sudan have led to massive displacement, limiting agriculture opportunities, increasing food prices and inflation.

After more than five years of conflict, South Sudan remains one of the most food-insecure countries in the world. Almost 7 million people are severely food insecure, the highest in the country’s history, and 21,000 people are likely living in famine conditions.

1.7 million people face acute food insecurity in Somalia, more than double what we saw at this time in 2017. This number is expected to rise to 2.2 million by September. However, the average number of people reached with food assistance from January to May 2019 declined 47% compared to those reached from August to December 2018.

Dr. Mesfin Teklu Tessema, Senior Director of Health at the International Rescue Committee, said, “Multiple countries in East Africa where the IRC works, especially Somalia and South Sudan, are facing extremely high levels of hunger. The IRC calls for early action and increased humanitarian support to these countries now in order to avert famine and save lives.

Food insecurity hits children the hardest. 860,000 children in South Sudan and nearly 1 million in Somalia are expected to suffer from acute malnutrition this year. Access to treatment is seldom guaranteed. Globally, roughly 80% of acutely malnourished children do not have access to treatment.

To address the treatment gap, the IRC and its partners have developed a new, simplified approach to malnutrition which treats moderate and severe acute malnutrition together in one program, with one therapeutic product. It has the potential to save millions more lives over the next decade.

As food insecurity continues to ravage East Africa, now more than ever, innovative solutions to hunger and malnutrition are needed. The humanitarian sector must adopt simplified approaches that expand access to treatment and build capacity at the community level so more children can get the help they deserve.”

The IRC has more than 400 staff in South Sudan responding to the increasingly dire food insecurity crisis through our support for health, nutrition, reproduction health and women’s protection and empowerment, child protection, as well as livelihoods. The IRC is one of the largest providers of aid in South Sudan serving more than 900,000 people.

The areas of concern, northern (Puntland) and central Somalia, are areas where the IRC is operational and scaling up our programming. The IRC is responding to the current drought supporting families with healthcare for malnourished children, unconditional cash transfers to help people quickly get the support they need, rehabilitation of boreholes and water sources as well as mobile health services to reach deeper into hard hit areas. The IRC will also be watching internal displacement towards urban centers, particularly Mogadishu, Galkacyo and Garowe. As the drought progresses, as people’s resistance begins to break down, we will likely see an increase in movement towards areas where families will anticipate that they can receive assistance. We will also be closely watching for, and responding to, increases in protection concerns, particularly gender-based violence, as displacement increases.

The IRC began working in Somalia in 1981 in the aftermath of the Somalia-Ethiopia conflict. Over the years operations faced several interruptions due to insecurity and civil unrest but has been operating continuously since 2007.

Severe flooding in South Sudan has affected close to a million people, threatening to reverse some of the humanitarian gains made during a year-long ceasefire in the country’s civil war, aid workers and UN officials say.

An estimated 420,000 people have been directly displaced by abnormally heavy seasonal flooding. Entire communities have been submerged, crops and livestock lost, with health centres and schools inundated – or in many cases turned into emergency shelters for people now made homeless.

“We have to respond to the people in need, to supply them with tarpaulins, water purification tablets, and food,” Alain Noudéhou, the UN’s emergency aid coordinator in South Sudan, told The New Humanitarian.

“If we don’t act quickly and in a targeted manner, the gains made in the past 12 months of stability will be set back.”

A government of national unity is due to be formed on 12 November, marking a formal end to a five-year conflict between President Salva Kiir and opposition leader Riek Machar – but the timetable has slipped and there have been calls for further delay.

The year-long ceasefire, however, has allowed aid agencies to reach parts of the country previously inaccessible due to fighting, which has killed almost 400,000 people.

Flooding toll

The UN’s emergency aid coordination body, OCHA, said floods have hit a total of 32 counties in Jonglei, Upper Nile, Warrap, Eastern Equatoria, Northern Bahr el Ghazal, Unity, and Lakes – areas where more than three million people were already in need of assistance even before the rains.

The rains, which began in July, are expected to last another four to six weeks – causing yet more hardship for the estimated 908,000 people so-far affected by the rising waters.

In Pibor, one of the hardest-hit towns on the eastern border with Ethiopia, Médecins Sans Frontières said 90 percent of homes are underwater, including its health centre and compound – now knee-deep in mud and with no electricity.

People are concentrated on whatever high ground they can find, cut off from assistance.

“We are seeing more malaria cases, watery diarrhoea cases, and respiratory tract infections as a result of the flooding,” said Edi Atte, MSF’s emergency coordinator. “The health condition of the people is deteriorating because they are drinking from open water sources.”

Atte told TNH that cholera was a real concern. “It’s something we fear. We have seen no cases yet, but it will come, I think.”

south-sudan-flood.jpg MSF People and their livestock are sheltering on what high ground they can find in the Pibor area.

MSF noted in a statement on Monday that there were enough drugs in Pibor to last one week, but resupply could prove difficult as the helicopter landing zone is a thin strip of land surrounded by water.

Aid agencies have appealed for $35 million to cover the immediate flood needs. But Noudéhou, returning from an assessment mission on Tuesday to the Jonglei region, said disaster risk reduction – to be better prepared for future floods – should also be a priority.

“It may cost a bit more, but in the longer term it will help prevent future vulnerability [and reduce disaster response needs],” he told TNH.

Recovery another challenge

The crisis will not be over once the water levels subside, which in the past has taken up to three months.

“The floods have worsened what was already a bad situation – people have lost everything, their belongings, their cattle,” said Atte. “Their conditions will be worse [when they return to their homes].”

There had been a marginal improvement this year in people’s food security. But 6.3 million people – more than half the population – still don’t know where their next meal will come from.

Among those are 10,000 people labelled as in “catastrophe”, a step away from famine, according to the latest update by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), a globally-accepted measure of nutrition needs.

The IPC has attributed the slight improvement in food security to the reduced violence following the signing of the peace deal in September last year, which led to improved access to rural markets for farmers, as well as a ramping up of aid supplies.

But there are still areas of localised conflict, and a failing economy has also dampened recovery, according to the IPC.

A shaky peace

The UN says 594,000 displaced people have returned home since the peace agreement was signed – but a further 1.5 million displaced have preferred to adopt a wait-and-see attitude, and there are still 2.2 million refugees in neighbouring countries.

“People are moving back, but not at the rate that will change the course of the food production deficit,” said Noudéhou. “Recovery will take time.”

Members of the UN Security Council, on a visit to South Sudan earlier this month, urged the country’s leaders to settle the outstanding issues over the implementation of the peace agreement – which has stalled on disagreements over new states, their boundaries, and the reunification of the security forces.

This week, a spokesman for opposition leader Machar called for a six-month delay in the formation of a unity administration, blaming the government for the lack of progress in implementing the deal, and raising the spectre of the agreement’s collapse.

A power-sharing government was initially meant to have been inaugurated in May.

“We need to have continued stability in the country for all the humanitarian gains over the past 12 months to be consolidated,” said Noudéhou. “Not just for the politics of the country, but for its recovery.”

“Without assistance, we would have starved,” added Nyabany, referring to food provided by the World Food Programme (WFP) and its partners as part of an emergency package to tide the most vulnerable through the toughest of times.

“Sometimes you end up asking, have the Gods forsaken us?”

Some 5.5 million South Sudanese, like Nyabany, are projected to be going hungry in early 2020 — according to forecasts from the last food security data prepared by Government and partners.

But experts warn that flooding in parts of the country since July means that the number of people in need is likely to increase in the coming months.

A deepening crisis

South Sudan is in trouble. But its problems go way beyond just a lack of food.

The country is still embroiled in a low-key conflict after being torn by years of bloodletting. Several peace deals were brokered, and broken. A fragile peace deal signed in September 2018 is largely holding and a delayed Transitional Government of National Unity is now expected to be formed in early 2020.

“South Sudan’s leaders will understand that donor fatigue is real,” said WFP Executive Director David Beasley on a recent visit to the country. “If we don’t get the money we need, they are going to have greater problems than they would have ever imagined. So, they need to bring peace.”

For many years, donors have been extremely supportive of South Sudan but like the suffering South Sudanese people, they are now growing tired of continually growing needs with no real solution to the country’s woes in sight.

Parts of the country were hit by severe drought in early 2019. This was followed by widespread flooding since July that has affected close to 1 million people and destroyed over 73,000 metric tons of cereals, which were ready for harvest.

Some farmers, who somehow managed to survive the conflict since 2013, were this year hammered by the drought followed later by the heavy rains.

“Sometimes you end up asking, have the Gods forsaken us?” asks Nyabany.

The country requires 1.3 metric tons of cereals annually, but produced just over half that — leaving a shortfall of over 525,000 metric tons, which is mostly covered by imports from neighbouring countries and overseas.

The combined impacts of drought, catastrophic flooding, rising poverty and a chronic economic downturn — along with prolonged political challenges — are pushing people over the brink unless food assistance is scaled up. This time, however, bringing in more food and nutrition support has its own challenges.

A crippling funding shortage

WFP, which this year ramped up its assistance to reach 4.6 million people with life-saving support, now faces a crippling shortage of funding from donors that threatens to jeopardize humanitarian work in the new year.

“If we don’t get funding in the next few weeks and months, millions of people will face hunger,” says Beasley. “We need support, we need help and we need it now.” WFP’s and its partners’ task in the coming months is to stop this from happening.

Humanitarian assistance has become a fragile lifeline in most areas of the country since famine was pushed back in 2017. WFP now needs US$270 million to avert a possible famine in 2020. Of this, US$100 million is required by the end of the year to buy and pre-position food ahead of the rainy season which will start in May, cutting road access to about 60 percent of the country.

If WFP doesn’t get the extra funding, it will be forced to take harsh decisions — including cutting planned assistance to 1 million vulnerable people.

ROME/JUBA – The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) is in a race against time to mobilize vital funds to feed millions of people in South Sudan as hunger advances on a population in dire need of humanitarian assistance. Catastrophic flooding over recent months is pushing the country and its people towards a precipice as the year ends amid intense political instability.

Up to 5.5 million South Sudanese are projected to be going hungry in early 2020 – according to forecasts from the last food security data prepared by Government and United Nations experts [1]. The number of people in need is likely to increase because of the catastrophic level of destruction caused by floods since October following a drought that hammered parts of the country earlier in the year.

""With all the catastrophes around the world, the last thing we need is another,” said WFP Executive Director David Beasley. “We know the problems that we’ve been having in South Sudan, but the rains and the floods have led to a national disaster and are much worse than anyone could have anticipated.”

“In fact, if we don't get funding in the next few weeks and months, we are literally talking about famine. We need support, we need help and we need it now,” he added

Close to 1 million people have been directly affected by flooding that destroyed 73,000 metric tons of potential harvests and wiped out tens of thousands of cattle and goats on which people depend for survival.

Humanitarian assistance provides a lifeline in most areas of South Sudan. In 2019, WFP ramped up its assistance to reach 4.6 million with life-saving support but now needs US$270 million for the first half of 2020. Of this, WFP needs US$100 million in the next month to buy and pre-position food ahead of the rainy season in May 2020.

The Government declared a state of emergency in late October in Bahr El Ghazal, Greater Upper Nile and Greater Equatoria because of the floods, calling for international assistance to be stepped up.

Famine in South Sudan was defeated after four months in 2017 by a concerted large-scale humanitarian response. Experts now say the country’s food security outlook has never been so dire.

When did the crisis in South Sudan start? South Sudan gained independence from Sudan in July 2011, but the hard-won celebration was short-lived. The Sudan People’s Liberation Movement, the ruling political party that originally led the way for independence, is now divided and fighting for power. In December 2013, political infighting erupted into violence in the streets of the capital, Juba, after South Sudan’s president accused his vice president of an attempted coup. Fighting between the two factions of government forces loyal to each soon moved to Bor, and then to Bentiu.

Violence spread across the young nation like wildfire, displacing 413,000 civilians in just the first month of conflict. Tens of thousands of civilians rushed to seek refuge in U.N. bases that were subsequently turned into makeshift displacement camps. The fighting has continued, becoming an increasingly brutal civil war and affecting the entire country. What's happening in South Sudan now? A handful of peace agreements have been signed over the course of the war — the most recent in September 2018 — but they have been repeatedly violated. While reported incidents of conflict have decreased somewhat since the new deal, the situation in South Sudan remains highly unstable and outbreaks of violence continue. Relatively small numbers of people have started to return home in light of the tenuous peace agreement, but new displacements continue and overall displacement remains high. Those affected are struggling to survive after years of protracted conflict that has destroyed livelihoods, forced people from their homes, disrupted planting and eliminated critical coping resources, like savings and livestock.

Tabu and her 2-year-old grandson walked for days to reach Uganda after deciding to run from the crisis in South Sudan. The journey was dangerous — they were shot at by armed forces — but their lives were at risk either way. “If I had waited there [in South Sudan], I would also die,” Tabu says.

Amelia, 18, carries firewood she collected herself so her family can cook. Survival tasks like this primarily fall to women and girls in South Sudan, but the chores are often done alone and away from the home, which makes them vulnerable to attack.

Those who’ve run have lost loved ones and their homes, their land and their livelihoods. Violence toward civilians has been widespread, including targeted attacks, gender-based violence, kidnappings and murders. Burning and pillaging of homes and livestock is rampant. And assaults on aid convoys and looting of supplies have become increasingly common, making it difficult — and dangerous — to reach in-need families with the support they need to survive. Nationwide, hundreds of thousands of young ones are facing an uncertain future — according to UNICEF, more than 70 percent of the country’s children are out of school.

Angelina and her children fled their home when their village erupted in violence. Having left everything behind, they survived by eating water lilies until being reached with food assistance.

Across the country, children can't learn, people can’t work, farmers can’t plant — all they can do is hope to survive until there is an end to the vicious fighting. How bad is the food crisis in South Sudan? Humanitarian efforts have helped prevent widespread starvation, but the situation in South Sudan is desperate again and the number of people facing hunger remains at record levels. After famine ravaged parts of South Sudan in 2017, people are still at risk of dying of hunger. Ongoing violence continues to keep people from their homes, damage markets and disrupt planting, all of which keeps them from getting the food they need to survive.

Mercy Corps provided Grace, a South Sudanese refugee in Uganda, with seeds and tools to plant after she fled South Sudan. With many people having left their homes and farms behind, it’s critical they can grow food in the places they are sheltering.

In May 2019, 6.9 million people were already at risk of going hungry and, without humanitarian support, that number could increase to more than 7.7 million in the coming months. If it does, it would be the highest number of people ever to face food insecurity in South Sudan. The upcoming lean season, the period between May and July when stores from the previous harvest are running low but the next is not yet ready, will be particularly threatening for vulnerable families. What are the effects of hunger in South Sudan? Hunger anywhere can have long-term, debilitating consequences, but it can be particularly threatening during a complex crisis like the one in South Sudan. When people go hungry, they have trouble staying healthy and become more vulnerable to dangerous diseases, which is a weakness people sheltering in makeshift camps and communities can’t afford. Their bodies are also not as strong or productive as they could be, which makes it difficult for them to work, find food and keep their families safe at a time when they urgently need the strength to do so.

Gideon, 9, fled from South Sudan to a refugee settlement in Uganda with his grandparents. Emergency cash from Mercy Corps helped the family purchase food.

Children’s development is also seriously impacted by hunger. Without proper nutrition, they don’t hit critical developmental milestones, which can permanently inhibit their ability to learn and function for the rest of their lives. Hungry children don’t learn as well, and they are also at a higher risk of disease. According to UNICEF, around 860,000 children under 5 in South Sudan are acutely malnourished.

Why did the humanitarian situation deteriorate so quickly? South Sudan was once a semi-independent region in Sudan, only recently gaining independence as a country in 2011, after a brutal civil war that lasted more than 25 years. The conflict in December 2013 reopened deeply-rooted political and ethnic tensions that hadn't yet been reconciled in the young country — and those divisions have continued to fuel ongoing clashes. After those decades of conflict, South Sudan was and still is one of the least-developed countries in the world, which has further complicated the situation. The larger cities in South Sudan had experienced some development, but the majority of the nation is rural. Even before the crisis, more than half of its citizens lived in absolute poverty, were dependent on subsistence agriculture and suffered from malnourishment.

""I am afraid we have lost our future and everything we worked so hard for to win our independence,"" says Chudier from the displacement camp where she's seeking safety. ""We worked hard to build a life here [in South Sudan] and have beds to sleep on, blankets and plates to eat off. Now it is all gone.” “I just want peace and to be able to take my family home, so they can have a normal life,"" she continues. ""I spent most of my life as a refugee, I don’t want my children to grow up like I did.” Because the economy was already fragile before fighting began, people like Chudier have very few resources to help them survive the long-term conflict and displacement they're now faced with. Plus, at this point in the war, many people have had to flee for safety more than once. Repeated displacement makes it impossible for people to regain any sort of stability — if they do manage to make progress by planting crops, purchasing animals or rebuilding livelihoods in their places of refuge, they must quickly abandon them if the fighting forces another escape. South Sudan also has very little formal infrastructure — roads, buses, buildings — which makes it difficult to transport food and supplies. Many towns and villages become inaccessible during the annual rainy season due to closed airstrips, washed out roads or lack of roads altogether, sometimes limiting any delivery of humanitarian aid to the isolated areas that need it most. These logistical constraints, combined with the violent context, make reaching people with the humanitarian support they desperately need incredibly challenging and risky. Over the course of the crisis, South Sudan has become one of the most dangerous places in the world to be an aid worker. Where have people from South Sudan fled to? An estimated 2.3 million people have crossed into neighboring countries including Ethiopia, Kenya and Uganda, resulting in Africa’s largest refugee crisis. Inside South Sudan, 1.8 million people are displaced. A small number of people have reportedly returned to their villages where there is relative stability, but most remain in their places of refuge and ongoing, sporadic attacks continue to force more people to flee for safety.

The majority of displaced families live outside the camps, wherever they can find safe shelter — often in small villages that offer some security, tucked away from the main areas of fighting. For those running from violence, there is no other choice but to flee into the bush with what little they can carry with them. How are people surviving outside of camps? Many families who've fled their homes have had to move multiple times to escape the spreading violence. Some run into the bush, with their children on their backs and little or nothing else. In the bush, there is often nothing to eat but wild plants like grass, roots and water lilies. But some people would rather face the risk of starving than endure the violence that has been rampant in towns and villages. For others, finding shelter in an isolated, small village, removed from the violence, is the best they can hope for. Those villages offer some sense of safety, but there is little in the way of food or supplies, and always the risk that fighting will come and families will have to flee yet again. Learn how we get to South Sudan's hardest-to-reach families ▸ Small food rations given out by aid organizations help somewhat, but escalating attacks on aid convoys and the annual rainy season make deliveries difficult and infrequent — not enough to count on. Mercy Corps is providing seeds and tools and helping to restart markets in small villages so food can be grown and accessed by families sheltering in rural areas.

Sanitation is extremely limited for families who have fled their homes, which heightens their risk of disease. Here, where families are sheltering in an abandoned area of nearby community, people do not have access to latrines and instead just use their surroundings.

Why is there a food shortage in South Sudan? South Sudan has agricultural potential, but due to poor infrastructure and lack of technology, growing enough food to feed everyone in the young nation has never been easy. After decades of struggle, food security was starting to improve before the current conflict began. In 2013, harvests of staple crops like millet, maize, and sorghum were up 20 percent (FAO). Unfortunately, the crisis in South Sudan has disrupted farming and any hard-earned improvements have been lost. Because of the fighting, people who would normally grow crops have been far away from their land, running and hiding from violence — unable to plant. Conflict has also reached the Equatorias, the area considered the breadbasket of South Sudan, which is exacerbating the food shortage. As conflict continues, many families are still far from home and unable to plant seeds, prepare land or harvest their crops. At one point, about half of all crops were in violence-ridden areas. Can people buy more food in South Sudan? Because of what's happening in South Sudan — violence, instability, recurring displacement — food stores are running out and many markets are empty. The threat of possible attacks, plus the high cost of transport and struggling economy, has hindered trade of food from safer areas. Plus, what little food is available has soared in price, and most displaced families have no money to buy any goods. While overall food prices are lower than last year, costs remain well above average throughout the country: in Juba, the price of sorghum is 203 percent higher than the five-year average, and in Wau, it’s 581 percent higher. Many families have lost their livelihoods, and purchasing power is extremely low. In Wau, it is estimated that nearly half of a day’s wage would need to go toward food to meet the average family’s needs, and most people are unlikely to have access to labor opportunities on a daily basis. What is life like in the camps? While there may be relative safety in the six U.N. camps, the conditions there are insufficient. The camps were not designed to host this many people for so long. Proper sanitation, hygiene and waste disposal are inadequate in such crowded conditions, and heavy seasonal rains flood many of the camps, making things even worse. What are the effects of disease? Beyond making everyday activities like sleeping and preparing food extremely difficult, heavy rains and standing water also increase the risk of disease.

Communicable and waterborne diseases like cholera and malaria spread quickly in these conditions. The risks are also high for other infections caused by contaminated water, malnutrition and weakened immune systems. Children are hungry and thirsty. If they get desperate, they may end up drinking dirty water that could give them an infection. For a young child, an infection can lead to weight loss, severe dehydration and even death. Outbreaks of cholera and measles have already been reported, and the presence of Ebola in neighboring countries poses a threat as well. Flare-ups are already ongoing in Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo, where more than a combined 900,000 South Sudanese refugees are sheltering. What are the most urgent needs in South Sudan camps? Displaced families receive some food, but there are urgent needs for additional food and disease prevention through better sanitation and access to clean water.

How can we help people in camps stay healthy? To help prevent outbreaks, better sanitation and clean water are critical. We’re building latrines and hand-washing stations, teaching proper hygiene and providing clean water, helping hundreds of thousands of displaced people stay healthy. Building latrines and teaching proper hygiene and waste disposal are the best ways to ensure that water sources stay clean for people to drink, cook and bathe. Read more about our hygiene response ▸ Is disease affecting other people in South Sudan? Yes. In 2018, outbreaks of measles, meningitis and Rift Valley fever, a viral zoonotic disease, were reported in areas across the country and resulted in deaths. Already in 2019, the number of reported measles cases is six times higher than in 2018. Nationwide, disease outbreaks are reaching new areas and lasting longer. The country suffered a protracted, widespread cholera outbreak between June 2016 and February 2018, with more than 20,000 suspected cases and at least 436 deaths. It was the longest cholera outbreak in South Sudan’s history. Additionally, medical care to cope with these risks is increasingly out of reach. Medicine is in short supply, and health workers and medical centers have been routinely targeted. Last year it was estimated that only around 20 percent of South Sudan’s health facilities are fully operational, and a meager 20 percent of the population can reach a hospital within 24 hours. Who is most affected by the crisis in South Sudan? Women and children are disproportionately impacted by the conflict in South Sudan. The majority of the population of the United Nations’ displacement sites is made up of women and children, with more than 60 percent of South Sudanese refugees being under age 18.

Additionally, sexual violence toward women and girls is pervasive. The United Nations recently reported a surge in sexual attacks, including women and girls experiencing abuse during raids on their homes, while they are fleeing or when they leave their shelters to search for basic necessities. The people committing these crimes are rarely held responsible. To make matters worse, women and girls continue to bear the burden of family caretaking even during crisis. In the face of heightened violence, recurring displacement and loss of livelihoods, daily tasks like collecting water and firewood can make them continual targets for attack. What will happen if the fighting continues in South Sudan? Without peace and support, the crisis in South Sudan will continue to deteriorate. Families will remain in hiding away from their homes and their land, unable to plant, and the economy will decline further. The number of people at risk of hunger will increase. Families will die from starvation, malnutrition and disease. Is South Sudan getting enough support? The short answer: no. Humanitarian appeals to provide support to South Sudan have been chronically underfunded. The UN appealed for $1.72 billion to assist people in need in 2018. Only 68 percent of the budget was funded. In 2019, the UN is appealing for $1.5 billion to provide critical support. Their request is so far only 30 percent funded, but it must be fully funded in order to reach the millions in need across the country. Many humanitarian organizations, including Mercy Corps, are partnering with the UN, using both private contributions and funding from the international community, to address the urgent needs of innocent people in South Sudan. There are many crises we are working to address, but this young and vulnerable country needs more help to avoid further catastrophe and human suffering.

How can we help people in South Sudan? Mercy Corps is working to provide desperately-needed latrines, showers, hand-washing stations and clean water to help people survive and prevent the spread of diseases like cholera in camps and communities. In the small villages where many people are sheltering, we have rehabilitated living spaces, provided seeds, tools and training so people can grow food wherever they are living, and implemented cash-for-work programs to give vulnerable families some money to purchase supplies. We're also distributing emergency funds to help traders and families access goods in hard-hit areas of the country. And our emergency education program trains teachers, repairs schools and provides school supplies and free meals so children can continue learning despite this crisis. In one refugee settlement in Uganda, we're providing cash aid that will allow refugees to buy what they need most while also stimulating the local economy.

“South Sudan is in trouble, serious trouble. Not just because of the conflict but because of the rains and the flooding that has hit in the last few months. It is much worse than we had anticipated”, said WFP Executive Director David Beasley.

“In fact, if we don’t get $100 million in the next few weeks…we are literally talking about famine in the next few months.”

State of emergency

South Sudan, the world’s youngest nation, has been plagued by conflict for most of its eight years of existence.

The country was hit by drought earlier this year, which was then followed by catastrophic floods, prompting the Government to declare a state of emergency in three regions in October.

The floods have affected nearly one million people and destroyed 73,000 metric tons of potential harvests.

Thousands of cattle and goats have also been wiped out, threatening the livelihoods of those who depend on these animals for their survival.

Food insecurity looms

Two years ago, South Sudan experienced a famine which was defeated by a large-scale humanitarian response.

However, WFP said experts now say the food security outlook has never been so dire.

WFP needs the $100 million to buy and pre-position food stocks ahead of the rainy season in May and will need $270 million for the first half of 2020.

This year, the UN agency stepped up its assistance in South Sudan to reach some 4.6 million people.

“With all the catastrophes around the world, the last thing we need is another”, said Mr. Beasley.

“We know the problems that we’ve been having in South Sudan, but the rains and the floods have led to a national disaster and are much worse than anyone could have anticipated.”

Humanitarian appeal and hopes for peace

Meanwhile, the humanitarian community in South Sudan has launched a $1.5 billion appeal to provide 5.6 million people with life-saving assistance in 2020.

Needs remain high despite a period of relative stability following the signing of a revitalized peace deal between the President and his main political rival last year, said the top aid official in the country.

Alain Noudéhou, the UN Humanitarian Coordinator in South Sudan, reported that overall, more than seven million citizens require support or protection, while nearly four million are displaced inside or outside the country.

“The people of South Sudan are impatient for peace,” he said. “The coming year offers great hope that the country’s leaders will begin the long road to recovery from conflict.”","In 2019, WFP ramped up its assistance to reach 4.6 million in South Sudan with life-saving support.

But getting the water with many people around and trying to observe social distance due to COVID-19 is a challenge. Everyone should comply for us to be safe but it’s always not the case’’, says 24-year old Abuk Yuah Ng’or.

Abuk lives in Molbog and like many young women from remote areas in South Sudan, has faced many challenges fetching untreated water from the River Nile for the past five years. The Surface Water Treatment (SWAT) facility in Molbog broke down in 2015 during the conflict and was rehabilitated this year serving 2,343 people.

“Before, my three children would often get sick from water-borne diseases because of the unclean water from the river. This always makes my life as a mother more difficult,” she says, adding, “When the water facility was restored by World Vision, my family are using safe and clean water.” Abuk gets her daily supply of clean water from one of the nine water points rehabilitated by World Vision through the support of Global Affairs Canada (GAC) aimed at sustaining a safe water supply for an estimated 42,598 people in South Sudan’s Upper Nile State.

“I am grateful to World Vision for this project that has helped change the lives of people in Molbog village. We have suffered for so long. Now it is our responsibility, especially the women in this community to manage and protect the water point and the SWAT system,” she shares. Arop Chan, Molbog’s village chief says, “The use of clean water is the most effective way to eradicate water-borne diseases. World Vision has helped establish this system and improved our way of life unlike in the past five years when we just depended on the river.”

The use of clean water is the most effective way to eradicate water-borne diseases. World Vision has helped establish this system and improved our way of life unlike in the past five years when we just depended on the river.

Abuk appeals for the extension of water pipelines and the construction of more water points to other populated areas of Molbog to help reduce walking distance and the spread of COVID-19. The community is responsible to take good care and maintain the water facility. A committee of seven people composed of three women and four men was organized to manage its operations and ensure that the people will have clean water at all times.

The waterpoints in Renk County are strategically located for women to conveniently access them for their household needs.

With the rising cases COVID-19 cases in the country, World Vision has installed in 18 handwashing facilities, distributed bars of soap and supplied 860 bags of chemical reagents like aluminum sulfate for water treatment in Malakal, Melut and Renk counties. In addition, new gender-friendly latrines were built in 10 schools and house-to-house campaigns are ongoing to ensure people are aware of the pandemic and what they need to do as prevention.

“The provision of clean water helps promotes good health and support from communities through exercising good hygiene practices such as handwashing, proper hygiene and social distance is crucial to stop the spread of the pandemic. World Vision’s commitment is to help educate communities to adopt these good practices for their own protection and safety”, says Amos Musembi, World Vision’s team leader in Renk County.

« The risk of a rapid spread of COVID-19 in South Sudan is high, due to the country’s weak health system, low water supply coverage, poor hygiene and sanitation services, as well as the challenge of maintaining key humanitarian supply chains through neighboring countries. This has left the South Sudanese population and residents highly vulnerable to epidemic diseases.. »

On 31 December 2019, a cluster of pneumonia of unknown etiology was reported in Wuhan City, Hubei Province of the People’s Republic of China. On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization’s (WHO) announced that the pathogen known as the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), now constituted a pandemic: “an epidemic occurring worldwide, or over a very wide area, crossing international boundaries and usually affecting a large number of people”.

COVID-19 is having an unprecedented impact across the globe both in terms of prompting the scaling of public health preparedness and response as well as protection of vulnerable populations.1 Furthermore, worldwide restrictions to supply chain and travel are increasingly posing significant obstacles to humanitarian aid, possibly curtailing the timeliness of future efforts.

The first case of COVID-19 in South Sudan was confirmed on 5 April 2020, since which point a further 2,211 cases have been confirmed as of 21 July 2020, with 45 deaths. The risk of a rapid spread of COVID-19 in South Sudan is high, due to the country’s weak health system, low water supply coverage, poor hygiene and sanitation services, as well as the challenge of maintaining key humanitarian supply chains through neighboring countries.

This has left the South Sudanese population and residents highly vulnerable to epidemic diseases, particularly women, children, persons with disabilities, the elderly, Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs), migrants and returnees.2 While the COVID-19 response is a health issue, it is bound to create a number of knock-on effects that will have lasting impacts on communities in South Sudan, further undermining their coping mechanisms and capacity to manage future shocks associated with disease outbreaks, extreme climatic conditions and conflict. The impact of the closure of borders and lockdown will compound the vulnerability of a population who had already been wrestling with the effects of a conflict-induced economic crisis, including rising food prices and inflation. The decline in the availability of resources may be a driver of conflict and violent competition, leading to an uptick in both localized violence and criminality.

In areas of high population density, such as displacement sites, populations are under the risk of being put under pressure to exit the sites to areas with very limited services where host communities are already facing challenges of their own. This – coupled with increased pressure or inability to generate an income for many South Sudanese who operate in the informal sector – could result in escalating tensions at the community level. As such, measures need to be in place from the beginning of the crisis to reduce the socio-economic and other impacts of COVID-19 and avoid severe shocks that will only act to exacerbate instability, bringing structural inequalities into sharper focus.

It is against this backdrop that IOM is appealing for USD 25 million to support key response activities in South Sudan across the various pillars over the period July 2020 – June 2021.","This has left the South Sudanese population and residents highly vulnerable to epidemic diseases.. »On 31 December 2019, a cluster of pneumonia of unknown etiology was reported in Wuhan City, Hubei Province of the People’s Republic of China.

Created: Thursday, 18 June 2020 05:46

The African Development Bank (AfDB) has approved a US$4.16mn grant to South Sudan to support the emergency response to COVID-19 and strengthen the country’s fragile health system

The grant, from the Transitional Support Facility of the Bank Group’s African Development Fund, will provide funding for the project to enhance the capacity of South Sudan’s health facilities and to bolster the country’s capacity to detect cases and curb the spread of the virus.

South Sudan reported its first case of COVID-19 on 5 April 2020, followed by increasing numbers of cases daily. As of 15 June 2020, the country had reported 1,693 cases, 27 deaths and 49 recoveries. The country remains at high risk. With limited hospital bed capacity, gaps in health workers’ skills and competencies and a lack of functioning medical equipment, South Sudan is ill-prepared to respond to the pandemic.

The confirmed cases are being managed at the country’s sole infectious disease facility, the Dr John Garang Infectious Diseases Unit. However, the current capacity of the facility is only 24 beds. There are limited facilities and capacities for isolation and management of COVID-19 cases at the state level as all samples from suspected COVID-19 cases have to be brought to Juba by air for testing. There are a limited number of isolation facilities outside the capital and no intensive care unit (ICU) facility.

The clinic services included general check-up, nutrition screening, immunization of children, ante-natal care and distribution of medicines and anti-malaria mosquito nets. It is in partnership with the Melut County Health Department.

An estimated 2,000 people rushed to the clinic. “The nearest facility for these people is over an hour by land transport. With the road destroyed, it will even be harder for them to go there just for a check-up”, Dr. Woldeyes explains. Many mothers have expressed their concerns over the rising threats of malaria as vast areas of Melut and Adar counties are still underwater.

Health coordinator Mawein Mathias Maring attends to a mother and her children during the health clinic. One of the children has skin problem in his face.

Harriet Yangi, a member of World Vision’s health team, said many of the pregnant women have not gone for an ante-natal check. “This is their first time to be checked. They are so happy we came here after the flood. They have no money to pay for the transport going to the clinic”, she says.

A midwife by profession, she is alarmed of the risks that the women, and their babies, face without proper check before and during pregnancy. Fifty-four pregnant mothers were screened, majority of them suffer malaria and urinary tract infection often caused poor hygiene. They are provided medicines sensitive to the term of pregnancy they are in.

She explains, “But I understand their situation. Without any resources, they are helpless. They need more support from organizations like World Vision. Flooding and disasters further increase the risks for them.” Health coordinator Mawein Mathias Maring found out many of the under-five children he was screening for malnutrition are suffering from scabies and skin diseases.

“The children have skin diseases, most are in their faces and heads. They look very itchy and they keep scratching them”, Maring adds. Though it needs more testing to confirm the problem, the mothers suspect the cause can likely be the water they are using from the ponds and stagnant river, where the children also play and swim every day.

Nutrition Officer Bridget Ajio said 137 children were screened with malnutrition, 69 of them are under five years old and 17 were admitted for the feeding program. Ninety-one pregnant and lactating women were also screened and six were admitted for the supplementary feeding program. ""Malnutrition will likely worsen during the incoming dry season. The impact of the flood will make it even more difficult for the women and children"", shares Ajio.

Agoth who manages the boat service that ferries World Vision’s staff and residents to cross the road destroyed by the flood and turned into a river said his last experience of the flood was in 2007. “But it was not this big. We were surprised at how the water eroded the road. Now it is all water”, he says.

The integrated health clinic has given the team an opportunity to reach-out to women and children's health and nutrition needs after the flood.

The boat, supported by a local company, moves at least 100 people who need to cross for free from morning to afternoon. “It is deep and the current is still strong”, Agoth adds. He said when the strong gush of water came at the height of the flood, the trees around got submerged and the current dangerously swift. A huge chunk of Adar road was destroyed.

World Vision has to rent a vehicle to transport its staff to the health and nutrition activity for flood survivors. Johnson LaFortune, World Vision’s Melut Team Leader expects the need from families to rise in the coming months with livelihoods and houses gone. He says, “The mobile clinic was immediately sent to respond to the people’s health and medical needs. But they need more – food, shelters and the children’s essentials.”

The Government of South Sudan has declared the recent flooding as a humanitarian emergency affecting an estimated one million people.

Committed team. Despite the difficult challenge of going to the flood-affected areas, the joint team of World Vision and Melut County Health Department gave their best to reach out to the people. Often they would walk home late and cross the river when the boatman has gone home.

But then Mary, 25, a mother herself, took a second look. The two motionless figures were awkwardly propped up against the trunk. The bodies were stiff. Both had died from dehydration.

This is Boma, a state in South Sudan that is suffering from one of the country’s worst water shortages.

The world’s youngest country has been ravaged by a brutal five-year civil war that has killed over 400,000 people and pushed its population to the brink of famine. That conflict nominally ended in September, with South Sudan’s president, Salva Kiir Mayardit, and the rebel group led by Riek Machar signing a historic peace deal.

But six months on, a simmering humanitarian crisis is threatening to unpick the tense truce.

And water, though often ignored, is now at the heart of a new wave of unrest.

✕ Water Wars: South Sudan's worsening water crisis

Nearly 80 per cent of the country has no access to clean water, according to the government water authority, which said vital infrastructure has been destroyed in the fighting.

With climate change driving up temperatures, water resources for cattle and agriculture are also in dwindling supply.

The shortages have sparked armed conflicts between several of the country’s 60 or so ethnic groups and could be the tinder box for fresh conflict in the future, officials have warned.

Caught in the crossfire are women, who are responsible for fetching water supplies even if it means making long and dangerous journeys.

Mary says she found the bodies along the dirt track that leads to a water pump from Gumuruq, a remote village only accessible by helicopter and a long drive on dirt track roads.

In this area, dozens of bore holes were destroyed in the civil war and so it is a treacherous eight-hour hike to the nearest water pump.

Along the way, women risk dying of thirst or hunger, as well as being attacked and even raped by men, who in the searing heat of the dry season ambush them for their jerry cans.

This, aid agencies say, is not a unique phenomenon for South Sudan – across the world, women are often the water fetchers and face similar violence.

Mary and five women who sit beside her all say they have been ambushed fetching water. One had been raped at gunpoint.

“I personally know 10 people who have died from thirst in the last 12 months, at least three already this year,” she tells The Independent from a tukul, or mud-packed reed hut, in her village.

“It is a common problem and it is going to get worse in the next few weeks, which is the peak of the dry season.”

“We have all been attacked walking to the bore holes. Water is scarce and the dry seasons are getting longer. This year we expect the number of deaths and attacks to be even higher.”

South Sudan is limping through one of the world’s most severe humanitarian crises. Four million people have been displaced internally or externally, while more than two-thirds of the country, or 7.1 million, rely on aid to survive.

Last month, the United Nations said that 1.5 million were on brink of starvation, and tens of thousands are already in famine.

Despite the peace deal, battles still rage in southern regions between the army and a rebel force that refused to sign the September deal.

Even the signatories to the agreement are wary of each other. The deal set a deadline for all sides to screen their respective forces and unify them into a national army before the formation of a unity government in May.

None of these steps have been completed yet.

But amid the mesmerising overlap of woes, water should not be an issue.

Officials in South Sudan’s water authority say there is more than enough water to serve the population of just 10 million.

The country is blighted by floods for more than half of the year and is crisscrossed with rivers, including the White Nile, one of the two main tributaries to the Nile. It also straddles three transboundary aquifers.

And yet according to Oxfam, which runs several water, sanitation and hygiene programmes (WASH), around 6 million people, or three-quarters of the population, are in need of help getting access to clean water and sanitation.

Millions are at risk of waterborne diseases such as typhoid and cholera, which spread unchecked in rural communities that lack access to basic sanitation.

Armed groups have deliberately targeted water infrastructure during the years of fighting as a way of destroying the communities of their enemies.

There are scant resources to rebuild these water holes: Oxfam and others say their WASH programmes are woefully underfunded. While Alier Ngongoka, the water authority chair, said only 0.1 per cent of the government budget is allocated for water.

Ratcheting up pressure is climate change. Seasonal rivers are drying up early, forcing people such as those in cattle herding communities to be on the move, sparking mini local wars which the water authorities fear could bleed into the national conflict. Cattle raids and related child abductions are on the rise.

Four million people have already been internally or externally displaced from the five-year civil war. But Ngongoka warned that if nothing was done to improve the water crisis, within two years there could be millions more on the move.

Rural communities would be forced to move to urban areas, piling pressure on scant resources at a time when South Sudanese refugees are also beginning to return to the country.

“Water creates real armed conflicts among the pastoral communities, particularly as the dry season is getting longer,” Ngongoka tells The Independent from his office in the capital Juba. “We have already seen fighting in areas like greater Jonglei, Akobo and eastern Equatoria.”

He adds: “With no support to our WASH activities to help communities access water we will see more conflict, particularly with the impact of climate change.”

Compounding the problem is the fact that as South Sudan has no storage facilities to collect and store water, there is also no data to ascertain the real size of the crisis.

And that is why the government is hoping to build a large dam on the White Nile just south of Juba, to also produce clean energy.

Every year the violence is getting worse because access to water is deteriorating Boma governor John Joseph

But that is a controversial decision. Egypt and Ethiopia, both Nile Basin countries, have nearly come to blows over the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) on the other main tributary: the Blue Nile.

Egypt’s population heavily relies on the Nile and so Cairo is terrified that Ethiopia’s dam, the largest hydropower plant in Africa, will drastically reduce water flow downstream and impact its national security.

The decade-long spat has yet to be resolved. Egypt has talked about the GERD being a “national security issue”.

A dam in South Sudan, on the other Nile source, could spark an international conflict if not carefully handled.

But for now the authorities are more concerned about domestic conflict and violence.

In Pibor, the regional capital of Boma where Mary is from, local governor John Joseph warns that people have already died in his state over water.

“As the government, we don’t have the capacity to build permanent water infrastructure for people or livestock,” he says. “Every year the violence is getting worse because access to water is deteriorating.”

The authorities say child abduction is also linked to South Sudan’s water troubles (Bel Trew)

Opposite his battered offices, across a dirt-track compound, local gender minister Lydia Agolory keeps a watchful eye over a toddler boy and a girl, who is barely five years old.

The children were abducted from their families in 2017 by cattle raiders but were only recently found.

Child abduction has become a business in the region as kidnappers are able to take children during raids and sell them for livestock to families who are unable to conceive.

But bizarrely the local authorities have linked the spike in abductions to the water crisis.

Cattle raids are increasing as shepherding communities are on the move looking for water resources or new livestock to replace those lost to thirst, leading to direct conflict with rival ethnic groups.

One of the main side businesses is taking children along with the cows.

These two children were too little when they were abducted to know their real parents, names or home towns and so are upset and confused.

Agolory explains it is too dangerous to keep the pair in Pibor, as they are at risk of being rekidnapped by the disgruntled family who paid 30 cattle for each of them. The children are put, sobbing, on a tiny propeller plane bound for the capital.

“In so many ways, women and children are worst impacted by the water crisis,” she adds.

Back in Gumuruq, Mary shows where the scars stutter across her arms and legs from when she was attacked by armed men while fetching water last year.

Two men demanded we lie down on our faces, they told me they would kill us if we didn’t do what they said Mother-of-three Elizabeth, in the village of Gumuruq

They flogged her so hard with sticks she was carried to a field clinic unconscious.

She then spent 10 months in hospital recovering and was only recently discharged.

“Since that time until now I am now too weak to get water,” she says.

“I still feel pain every day,” she adds, before trailing off.

Elizabeth, 35, who sits beside her, says she was raped at gunpoint in February 2016 by a gang of men who, she says, hide in the bush preying on women fetching water and firewood.

“Two men demanded we lie down on our faces, they told me they would kill us if we didn’t do what they said,” the mother-of-three explains.

“I had no power and had to surrender myself to him,” she adds.

But the situation is even worse in Manyabol, a two-hour drive from Gumuruq, along a recently cleared dirt track. The village is so remote the commissioner of the area makes a point of repeatedly saying we are the first white people to set foot there.

Scrambling through the bush, heavy with birdsong, villagers from the Murle ethnic group that live there point out the water pumps that were destroyed in the fighting a few years ago.

Members of the Dinka in Bor, a neighbouring but rival ethnic group who took an opposing side in the civil conflict, had bulldozed all the water pumps in the area with armed vehicles to devastate the local community, according to local officials.

With resources stretched to breaking point, no aid organisation has been able to make it this far to repair the damage.

That day, a team from Oxfam were visiting the area to assess the damage.

“It was a deliberate attack to try to destroy the town, where 2,000 people live,” says loca commissioner Jacob Labousho. “But we hope now there is peace agreement, we can move on from this and get assistance to rebuild.

“No aid organisations come this far but with the seasonal rivers drying up early we have no access to water.”

Marconi Kuju, a member of the Oxfam team, says 100 water pumps were destroyed in that area alone, forcing women to walk up to 10 hours for water.

“It is an issue of money, there is a big funding gap for WASH programmes because it doesn’t attract the same level of attention as other crises,” he says.

Oxfam has only received funding to build two new bore holes this year. Their teams were busy drilling one, about four hours away near the capital Pibor.

It’s a race against time: the water level is dropping each year, meaning they have to dig even deeper, making the drilling process more expensive.

At one pump rehabilitated by the aid organisation last year, a line of women, who have walked for hours, start the laborious process of pumping water into dozens of jerry cans.

It is exhausting work. In the searing heat they take turns to throw their full body weight on the metal lever to fill the canary-yellow containers.

As the pressure mounts, a fight breaks out. Only two of the six pumps in this area are working, which is causing problems because the population is booming.

“The water levels are too low so it’s hard to pump – it can take an hour to fill a single jerry can,“ Nachunalan, 43, says, taking a breather by a patch of reeds.","This is Boma, a state in South Sudan that is suffering from one of the country’s worst water shortages.

South Sudan, the world’s youngest country, has faced adversity and troubled times since its founding. Its separation from Sudan was accompanied by significant conflict, beginning with the advent of civil war in December 2013. The widespread conflict led to many humanitarian crises and the country did not see peace until a cease-fire was issued in August of 2018. Five years later, the effects of this conflict persist and can be seen in the nation’s water crisis. Here are six facts about the water crisis in South Sudan.

6 Facts About the Water Crisis in South Sudan

Only 41 percent of people in South Sudan had access to clean drinking water in 2019. In urban areas, residents often live too far from water sources to walk and are forced to rely on deliveries, driving up the cost of water. This forces many lower-income families to go without. Outside the metropolitan areas, water wells are not reliable either. During the conflict, armed groups destroyed the wells of many communities, hoping to defeat them. Now that the fighting is over, these wells remain destroyed, and even if they are within walking distance, people may not have access. Having to travel long distances to obtain clean drinking water also creates health and safety concerns for women and children in South Sudan. Walking long distances every day to access water increases the risk of severe dehydration as well as violence and kidnappings. The conflict has also displaced more than two million people, driving them into other countries or away from their available water sources. People settled in rural areas are heading to the cities, putting further pressure on already strained water sources and worsening the water crisis in South Sudan. According to data from 2016, one in three people use contaminated water daily. This water may come from the Nile or from swamp areas, both of which present immense risks of bacterial infections. When the choices are either to be thirsty or drink dirty water, people have to choose the water. As a result of the contaminated water, there were 20,000 reported cases of cholera in South Sudan between June 2016 and the start of 2018. Most water in South Sudan is not put towards domestic use. 97 percent goes to the agricultural industry, and in these strenuous times, a lack of water presents challenges for their main industry. 80 percent of the South Sudanese support themselves through farming, and without enough water to grow crops, their nutrition and economy suffer. A total of 871 million dollars has been given to South Sudan so far, but this only meets half of the goal to solve the crisis. Still, significant work is being done by humanitarian organizations, including Oxfam, which is working on the ground to improve access to clean drinking water. Its goal is to make long-lasting, sustainable changes to how water is accessed in order to end the water crisis in South Sudan.

While there is still progress to be made, there have been decreases in the percentage of people without drinkable water, especially in urban areas. Moving forward, as clean water reaches more remote areas, water accessibility in South Sudan will become more stable, greatly improving livelihoods.

According to government estimates, 80 percent of South Sudanese do not have steady access to clean water. The government says this is largely due to the destruction of infrastructure during the civil war that festered following the country’s independence from Sudan in 2011.

At the same time, the United Nations reports that 6.5 million people, more than half the country’s population, do not have enough nutritious food to eat. The number is expected to rise to 6.9 million in May and June, the end of the dry season. Erratic rainfall hampered early 2019 planting efforts, and food prices are beginning to rise.

A new report on conditions in South Sudan notes that water shortages have spurred conflict between many of the nation’s dozens of ethnic groups. In some areas, residents have died from dehydration.

“There has been no change for us since the peace deal was signed,” a woman named Nachunalan told The Independent. She emphasized the debilitating effects on women, who are forced to gather water and often caught in the crosshairs of conflict. “Women are facing thirst, hunger, and violence. When will it end?”

South Sudan’s civil war lasted five years, displaced millions, and left an estimated 400,000 people dead. Last year’s truce eased fighting, but experts warn that the agreement is precarious and the young country could become embroiled again in battles over food and water.

“We have all been attacked walking to the boreholes. Water is scarce and the dry seasons are getting longer. This year we expect the number of deaths and attacks to be even higher,” explained Mary, a 25-year-old mother from Boma. Mary claimed to know 10 people who died from thirst in the past year.

Harnessing Supply

In many ways, South Sudan has a bountiful water supply. The White Nile and several other rivers run through the country. During the wet season, flooding is common. Yet the country is failing to harness the resource in a way that will halt violence and quench the thirst of its citizens.

Local governments recognize their inadequacies, but say they have limited funds and expertise to improve water infrastructure and storage capabilities.

“As the government, we don’t have the capacity to build permanent water infrastructure for people or livestock,” John Joseph, the governor of Boma, told The Independent. “Every year the violence is getting worse because access to water is deteriorating.”

Aid groups are working to improve infrastructure, but water, sanitation, and hygiene programs are poorly-funded. In some areas, violence is also limiting humanitarian access.

The government has discussed building a dam on the White Nile, but the plausibility of the project is unsure. In the meantime, just 0.1 percent of the national budget is set aside for water.","According to government estimates, 80 percent of South Sudanese do not have steady access to clean water.

664,https://www.waterforsouthsudan.org/wfss-blog-use/2015/12/9/preventing-water-contamination,Preventing Water Contamination — Water For South Sudan,"Water contamination is a universal issue that affects millions of people worldwide. In the US the issue was thrust into the spotlight over the controversy surrounding hydraulic fracking. The pumping of chemicals such as benzene near, or in some cases directly above, the ground water supply did not sit well with some Americans. In addition, a variety of viral videos and public accounts, most notably 2010’s Gasland, shed light on what effects these chemicals could have on the water supply. Videos showing tap water that burst into flames upon contact with a lighter showed the consequences of some of America’s pursuit of natural resources.

However, the USA is not the only country affected by water contamination. In fact, many countries throughout the world face problems that are perhaps more severe than those caused by hydraulic fracking. Diseases such as cholera, typhoid and dysentery are all caused by water pollution. Sadly, South Sudan is not immune to such disease. In fact, much more of South Sudan’s population is at risk for water contamination than is the United States’. IRIN News reports that South Sudan has a water contamination problem that is two-fold. Not only is some of its drinking water contaminated, but the methods used to transport the water are often unsafe. Tankers that have been exposed to deadly diarrheal diseases are often reused and carry infected water into largely populated areas. In fact, CCN recently reported an outbreak of cholera in a crowded military barrack that result in around 200 deaths of armed personnel within South Sudan. Additional reports showed contamination of water wells in Unity State by nearby oil fields. Clearly, this is a problem that has large implications and a number of disastrous outcomes for a country that is already affected in a number of ways.

Water for South Sudan (WFSS) is committed to drilling new wells and providing greater access to a clean water supply. WFSS takes great care in the installation of wells to avoid contamination of the water source. In 2015 WFSS surveyed a large statistical sampling of wells which showed all to be in good operating order. WFSS also found that some of the cement platforms are in need of repair. They will launch a pilot platform rehabilitation team in 2016 to begin to address this issue, and to also continue to preserve the good quality of the water source for wells.

In addition, as the number of clean drinking wells increases, communities will have more access to fresh water, and this in turn will limit the need for transport vehicles that can become contaminated. Joining with WFSS we can make a difference and stop the spread of harmful diseases.","However, the USA is not the only country affected by water contamination.

The continuation of conflict since December 2013 has created a complex humanitarian crisis in the country, restricting humanitarian access and hindering the flow of information required by aid partners to deliver humanitarian assistance to populations in need. To address information gaps facing the humanitarian response in South Sudan,

REACH employs its Area of Knowledge (AoK) methodology to collect relevant information in hardto-reach areas to inform humanitarian planning and interventions outside formal settlement sites.

Using the AoK methodology, REACH remotely monitors needs and access to services in the Greater Upper Nile, Greater Equatoria and Greater Bahr el Ghazal regions. AoK data is collected monthly and through multi-sector interviews with the following typology of Key Informants (KIs):

KIs who have been in contact with someone living in a hard-to-reach settlement, or have been visiting one in the last month (traders, migrants, family members, etc.)

KIs who are remaining in hard-to-reach settlements, contacted through phone

Selected KIs are purposively sampled and have knowledge from within the last month about a specific settlement in South Sudan, with data collected at the settlement level. About half of settlements assessed have more than one KI reporting on the settlement. In these cases, data is aggregated at the settlement level according to a weighting mechanism, which can be found in the Terms of Reference (ToRs). ( Link to AoK Terms of Reference )

All percentages presented in this factsheet, unless otherwise specified, represent the proportion of settlements assessed with that specific response.

The findings presented in this factsheet are indicative of the broad water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) trends in assessed settlements in December 2019, and are not statistically generalisable.

Every day, she walks about four kilometres to fetch water at this well.

The 15-year-old carries 25 litres of water in a container all the way back home.

An ongoing drought in the country has left many residents like Abuk without access to clean water, forcing them to draw the little water they can from wells that are already running dry.

“We only take a meal in the evening as we are unable to cook in the morning because that is the time when we collect water,” she said.

South Sudan has been hit by the same east African drought that has pushed Somalia back to the brink of famine, six years after 260,000 people starved to death in 2011.

The country is facing a deadly blend of conflict, economic hardship and poor rains.

The drought has worsened the situation in the oil-rich country which has been mired in civil war since President Salva Kiir, sacked his deputy Riek Machar, in 2013.

The fighting has forced 3 million people to flee their homes, split much of the country along ethnic lines and paralysed agriculture, prompting the U.N. to declare last month that parts of the country are suffering from famine.

Only 41 percent of children have access to clean water in the country and the drought has further exacerbated the situation, leaving water points dry.

This acute shortage of clean water is posing an additional threat to hundreds of thousands of severely malnourished children in South Sudan as it can lead to an increase in life threatening waterborne diseases such as diarrhoea and cholera according to the UN children’s agency, UNICEF.

Aid agencies are working to rehabilitate old boreholes and increase water points as well as sanitation facilities for communities.

Half of the water points in the country have been damaged or destroyed according to UNICEF and the scarce water sources available are being overused.

“About 5 million people in the country don’t have access to safe water. Why is safe water so important for nutrition? — Because if you don’t have safe water, you are liable to catch either a waterborne disease or get diarrhoea. A simple bout of diarrhoea can induce malnutrition really in a matter of days. And if that malnutrition is severe, the child will die,” said Jeremy Hopkins, the UNICEF acting country representative in South Sudan.

“I feel nice about my body when there is water. If there is no water, I will not feel good because I’m unable to bathe,” said Abuk after using water from a rehabilitated well on the outskirts of Aweil town.","Abuk Garang lives in a village on the outskirts of Aweil town, in northwest South Sudan.

Rwanda is a landlocked country located in Central-East Africa, bordered by Uganda to the north, Burundi to the south, Democratic Republic of Congo to the west and Tanzania to the east (Mukanyandwi et al. 2018). Rwanda has two rainy and two dry seasons, referred to as long and short. The first rainy season runs from March to May and the second spans late September to November, with an average rainfall of 110–200 mm per month. Rwanda also has two dry seasons; the first (short) dry season lasts from December to the end of February, while the longer one begins in June and runs to early September. The average temperature ranges between 19 and 27 °C (Nahayo et al. 2018).

In Rwanda, there are abundant water resources (Fig. 1). The total area of Rwanda is 26,338 square kirometers, including about 128,190 ha of lakes, 7260 ha of rivers, and 77,000 ha are occupied by marshlands. In addition, there are about 22,300 springs (Ali et al. 2014; Nsengimana et al. 2012). To ensure that water undergoes prior treatment and to increase access to safe drinking water, about sixteen water treatment plants are operating countrywide. These initiatives have increased the percentage of people accessing safe drinking water from 23% in 1990 to 82% in 2016 (Rutanga and Niyigena 2016; Karamage et al. 2016) . Therefore, The water samples were collected from springs in different areas in country to ensure that the water quality of selected springs is healthy according to the World Health Organization for metals in water(Table 1).

Table 1 Names and location of the sampling sites Full size table

Field sample collection and experimental approaches

The water samples were collected from nine drinking water sources located in urban, semi-urban, and rural areas of Rwanda, during the dry season (July–September) and rainy season (October–December), respectively.

The authors collected three water samples monthly from each sampling site from a foot below the water surface. The samples were preserved in acid-washed 100-mL polypropylene bottles to avoid changes in characteristics, and were digested, concentrated, and prepared for analysis by atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AAS) using an AA Spectrometer M Series.

We conducted extensive monthly water quality monitoring and the measured elements were calcium (Ca), iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), copper (Cu), aluminium (Al), and zinc (Zn). The drinking water samples of dry and rainy seasons were compared, the monthly maximum rainfall (mm) records at each meteorological station neighboring the water sampling site were obtained (Fig. 2) for July, August, and September for the dry season, and October, November, and December for the rainy season of 2017. During the analysis, the rainfall variability was referred to in order to better understand how changes in rainfall might influence the drinking water quality.

Indexing approach

Metal index

This study used the metal index (MI); it is generally used for metals in drinking water quality (Goher et al. 2014). The metal index takes into account possible additive effect of metal elements on the human health that help to quickly evaluate the overall quality of drinking waters. Metal index is given by the expression proposed by Caeiro et al. (2005) and is calculated as indicated below:

$$ MI=\sum \limits_{i=1}^n\frac{CI}{\left(\mathrm{MAC}\right)i} $$ (1)

where MAC is the maximum allowable concentration and Ci is the mean concentration of each element. The higher concentration of metal was compared with its respective MAC value that shows the worse quality of water. MI value > 1 is a threshold of warning (Bakan et al. 2010). Water quality and its suitability for drinking purpose can be examined by determining its metal pollution index (Mohan et al. 1996; Reza and Singh 2010). This study applied the above metal index for the estimate value of six metal elements, namely, aluminium, calcium, manganese, copper, iron, and zinc.

Contamination degree (Cd)

The contamination degree is defined as the sum of all concentration factors (Rahman et al. 2014). The water samples are classified by calculating the degree of contamination in water samples. Contamination degree, by added various parameters assuming water quality, investigates the convenience of drinking water samples for municipal consuming (Backman et al. 1998). The contamination degree has to be calculated split up for all samples, based on the surpassed parameters from standard values. This index is calculated as follows:

$$ \mathrm{Cd}=\sum \limits_{i=1}^n{\mathrm{Cf}}_{\mathrm{i}} $$ (2)

Cf i can be obtained from Eq. (3)

$$ {\mathrm{Cf}}_{\mathrm{i}}=\frac{{\mathrm{CA}}_{\mathrm{i}}}{{\mathrm{CN}}_{\mathrm{i}}}-1 $$ (3)

In many developing countries restricted funding is usually combined with fragile or unstable institutions and limited technical capabilities to deal with an expanding range of water quality problems. Therefore, there needs to be a priority on establishing a coherent and realistic national policy response to water quality management so that limited funds and strengthening of capacity are strategically focused on essential issues, and institutional inertia or competition is eliminated. For example, the present state of many national data programs, for which there are no clear data objectives and no defined users of the data, represents an expensive failure of national policy. At the technical level, there has been great progress in western nations in developing more cost-effective monitoring, analytical protocols, and assessment methods. This flows not only from better scientific knowledge, but also from recognition that conventional monitoring programs are inefficient, expensive, and often not very useful. Regrettably, financial institutions and ODA programs tend to reinforce conventional approaches in developing countries with the result that these countries have little opportunity to develop a new, more appropriate and more sustainable data paradigm. In lesser developed countries where public health is the major concern, the traditional model of a centralized monitoring program often does not work, suggesting that a new model of decentralized community-based monitoring would be more effective. Growing national priorities for remediation of water quality in lake and river basins demonstrate the gap between needs and abilities in developing countries. This gap has a profound effect both on the types of interventions that are being (or should be) implemented and on how these can be sustained in developing countries. The increasing need for defensible, rational, remediation programs argues for a new model for capacity building so that the role of the consultant (company) is reduced to one of facilitator and not the primary implementer. Conventional approaches to river and lake restoration, such as dredging, are often ineffective and expensive. Alternative technologies that are more effective and sustainable are usually not considered because they do not fit into conventional engineering solutions. Financial sustainability is not a simple problem. It requires, in the first-instance, a well-defined and targeted program that meets specific management needs. It includes potential for cost-avoidance and cost-reduction as well as cost-recovery and income generation. It also depends on management and business skills at the program level and on fiscal policies and accountabilities at the state level that permit earnings retention and reinvestment. Experience suggests that redesign of national water quality data programs, including technical, institutional and legal components, is an effective first step to achieving cost-efficiency.","The sustainable management of water quality has policy, technical, institutional and financial components.

The revelation was made Wednesday by the Deputy Director General of Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM), Paul Kabalisa, during a consultative meeting in Kigali that brought together partners and organisations involved in water resources management.



“It (policy) provides a framework for equitable allocation of water resources and the sharing of benefits derived from that resource,” he said.



The meeting observed that lack of substantial data and information regarding the status of the country’s water resources was a hinderence in the ongoing water conservation and management campaign. However, the stakeholders resolved to play a leading role towards achieving this goal.



Another major challenge was insufficient awareness about the country’s water resources management policy that was launched last month. Other limiting factors cited were increasing water pollution and contamination due to invasive weeds, intensive soil erosion, sedimentation and poor sanitation facilities.



The Chairperson of Rwanda Water Partnership, Patrick Safari, called upon the general public and local leaders to equally embrace the conservation campaign.

by Julia Migné

With more than 70% of our planet’s surface being covered in water, it is easy to sometimes forget how precious that seemingly endless resource actually is.

Despite its apparent abundance, the World Health Organization reported this year that “785 million people lack even a basic drinking-water service” around the globe.

Restricted access to clean drinking water has a heavy impact on women who often end up having to be the ones collecting it and bringing it back home.

In Rwanda, one woman saw how pressing the need to provide clean drinking water was and decided to launch a social enterprise, Water Access Rwanda, to tackle the issue head-on.

Christelle Kwizera, Managing Director and Founder of the company, talked to INKLINE about the importance of involving young people in the enterprise and shared with us what is in the pipeline for Water Access Rwanda.

INKLINE: What was the water situation like in Rwanda before you launched your social enterprise?

Christelle Kwizera: In 2014, when Water Access Rwanda started, there was a pressing and urgent need to provide clean drinking water for people living around areas where crocodiles had infested lakes and rivers.

As of 2015, only 56.7% of Rwandans had basic access to clean drinking water . More so, waterborne illnesses claim the lives of infants and adults because of contaminated water sources.

The time spent fetching water disrupts education and economic development and traps families in a cycle of poverty. The Rwandan government is still striving to make clean water accessible to all, with ambitious plans to do so within the next two years.

I: Why did you decide to start a social enterprise tackling that specific issue of water scarcity?

K: Water Access Rwanda was started to eliminate water scarcity in Rwanda while employing young people as solution providers. As a long term youth advocate, I knew the biggest issue facing youth was underemployment. I also saw potential in technologies that made drilling boreholes much more affordable, especially those promoted by Water4, a US-based NGO.

I wanted to address both the issues, but also to create a self-sustained enterprise in a drive to see users of our services as customers who dictate what they receive from us rather than beneficiaries who should just accept what is provided.

So I decided to drive my business acumen into the water sector, mainly because I saw the lack of access as a big factor that traps families in poverty and results in more gender inequality by having women spend the most time on collecting water.

Being a social entrepreneur has helped me put into practice how business can benefit people. It’s more rewarding than being an average Wall Street person.

In 2017, WARwanda launched the INUMA groundwater solar kiosk project, which is a new model for sustainable provision of purified groundwater to rural and semi-urban areas, by selling it to the local communities. It is providing better access to water, ensuring the sustainability of water systems and the plan is to guarantee continuous clean water supply for villages.

I: How you are revolutionising the water industry in your country?

K: We adopt affordable technologies. Not every borehole needs to be drilled via air rotary which is quite expensive. We have now drilled over 50 boreholes with manual tools. We also use an innovative geophysical surveying toolkit to cut the cost of VES surveys.

Most importantly, is INUMA™, which filters groundwater from borewell and distributes it right up to people’s homes.

I: What challenges did you face while working on Water Access Rwanda?

K: Some members of the communities would reject the clean water infrastructure and go back to using free surface water. This is why we place so much value on behavioural change campaigns and cooperation with the local government to overcome this challenge.

We do note a reduction in usage during the rainy season and are mitigating this through access to water at home.

More than 1.3 million litres of purified clean water can be distributed monthly at INUMA kiosks. © Water Access Rwanda/Facebook

Another challenge I personally face is how much managing a company is about managing people. As a young founder and managing director, this has so far been the challenge I spend the most time addressing. I have learnt many lessons in the process and overcome the initial shock by also accepting that I can’t bring a solution to every situation.

I: Engaging youth seems really important to you, could tell me more about your Summer Warrior Internship Program?

K: Providing water systems has allowed me to achieve my other goal which is to employ young people and see communities develop. The Summer Warrior Internship program was established in the purpose of helping students, who are in their second or third year of university, practice their skills and learn other new ones from a real-life situation of working in the development field.

It targets students who wish to have a social impact as part of their careers and who want to develop valuable professional and social skills through interactions with WARwanda staff and participation in regular office activities.

Offering job opportunities for young people is an important part of WARwanda’s mission. ©Water Access Rwanda/Facebook

The Water Warriors Student Volunteer Program is targeted at secondary students during their gap year and during their university education period in Rwanda.

The long-term plan is for all rural and peri-urban Africa to have access to piped clean drinking water and we intend to play a major role in this!

Gap-year students who already possess a set of basic and desirable office working skills are involved in this program which will see them assigned projects, shadowing staff in future dream positions and contributing to the eradication of the water crisis very early on in their career.

Engaging the youth is very important because youth underemployment is a pressing issue within East Africa and there is a need to purposefully engage youth into work that is economically empowering their nations.

Being a social entrepreneur has helped me put into practice how business can benefit people. It’s more rewarding than being an average Wall Street person.

I: You also have a strong focus on climate. What are you hoping to achieve with the Water For Climate project?

K: The Water For Climate project is about providing clean water to several villages who would have had to boil the water otherwise, thus saving a lot in carbon emissions.

The project is with Spadel, via CO2 Logic and Mkaarbon Safari. It is a 10-year project which will ensure continuous maintenance and care of water points.

I: How do you assess the impact you are having?

K: Data is the most important tool in delivering our solution, especially as it emphasises heavily on creating customers and not just beneficiaries. We keep a regular track and also conduct periodic surveys on users and their satisfaction of INUMA water, volume of litres sold, jobs created, hours spent collecting water, etc…

Always strive to make your customers so happy that they are the ones showering you with awards and good word of mouth marketing.

All our data is then disaggregated to see patterns of gender, age and location. We further relate our impact on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), where we have done an SDG framework analysis and noted 13 SDG targets we are impacting and positively affecting through our work.

I: Anything exciting in the pipeline for WARwanda?

K: The short term plan for WARwanda is to connect 100 households to clean water in their homes. The more ambitious mid-term goal is to go to a new market with INUMA™. The long-term plan is for all rural and peri-urban Africa to have access to piped clean drinking water, and we intend to play a major role in this.

I: If you could give a piece of advice to someone who wishes to start a social enterprise what would it be?

K: As a social entrepreneur, you are solving a need for your customers. Make sure to find and grow happy clients, listen to them and transform their need into your market.

© Water Access Rwanda

The world is ready and waiting for successful stories of social entrepreneurs, this results in a lot of media coverage and awards, even at the idea stage, so you need to keep yourself grounded amidst all this praise and attention.

Always strive to make your customers so happy that they are the ones showering you with awards and good word of mouth marketing.

Rwanda is on track to become the first African country to provide 100% of its citizens with piped water, improving on what is already an impressive 85% countrywide access. The government is striving to ensure universal water access by 2024 through increasing investment in construction and extending water supply systems across the country, according to Prime Minister Édouard Ngirente. The country is racing against Seychelles, where 96% of households currently have piped water. Barring geographic encumbrances, that island nation could hit 100% water connectivity before Rwanda does.

At the inauguration of the new Nzove Water Treatment Plant and the upgrading of Nzove II in the capital city of Kigali, the prime minister said the attainment of such an ambitious goal required the involvement and commitment of both government and development partners in the water sector, as well as that of citizens.

“The upgraded Nzove Water Treatment Plants are a major milestone in providing access to clean drinking water for our citizens,” he said.

In its Human Development Report 2006, the United Nations Development Programme agrees that in seeking to expand access to clean water, “decisions about the appropriate public-private mix have to be taken case by case on [the basis of] local values and conditions.”

The New Times newspaper reports that the Nzove I Water Treatment Plant, which has been pumping 40 000 cubic metres per day, was upgraded to produce 65 000 cubic metres per day, while Nzove II was upgraded from 25 000 to 40 000 cubic metres per day.

According to Claver Gatete, the Minister of Infrastructure, the facilities were constructed by Culligan International East Africa and Central Asia for US$40.2 million, funded by the government of Rwanda. The investment includes forwarding infrastructure to Mont Kigali and Rebero reservoirs.

Water projects

The government also plans to upgrade Nzove ESPINA from 25 000 to 40 000 cubic metres per day, which will bring the total water production capacity for Nzove Catchment to 145 000 cubic metres. The Water and Sanitation Corporation (WASAC) also aims to address the issue of water shortages in in Kigali, as well as the construction of advancing infrastructure and distribution network.

“Our target is to do everything that is possible to make water available to all. To achieve this there will be construction of new water treatment plants, as well as the upgrading of existing ones in rural areas, small cities, secondary cities and in the city of Kigali,” the prime minister said.

The news site Pulse Live reports that Rwanda has also secured two loans from the African Development Bank of US$268.5 million and US$131 million respectively. The country is also sourcing additional investment from various development partners to implement a number of projects, including the upgrade, rehabilitation and extension of the Kigali Water Supply Network, to be completed by December 2020. The project is expected to boost the water supply in the suburbs of Kigali, including Kabeza, Samuduha, Busanza and Kanombe, according to the minister.

“Inadequate financing is the single most important factor affecting the continent’s fresh water delivery abilities,” Peter Akari, chief water policy officer of the African Water Facility at the African Development Bank, told Africa Renewal, a magazine published by the United Nations.

Then there is the construction of the Nzove–Ntora forwarding infrastructure, which would evacuate 70 000 cubic metres, expected to be completed by September 2021 with the support of the Japanese government.

The Rwandan government also plans to generate 40 000 cubic metres from the Kanzenze (Metito) Water Treatment Plant under a public-private partnership (PPP) framework to supply the city of Kigali and parts of Bugesera District. This is expected to be commissioned in June 2020.

Patricie Uwase, the Permanent Secretary at the Ministry, made the disclosure on Monday during a press conference organised by officials from Rwanda Utilities Regulatory Agency (RURA) and the Ministry to dispel fears of possible hike in water tariffs.



The government has earmarked funds to build more water treatment plants following an upgrade on Nzove plant and the ongoing construction of Kanzenze plant that will provide some 40,000 cubic metres to Kigali city and Bugesera District.



“Since 2016 under the new water and sanitation policy we have been increasing investments. For instance, we are investing $440 million in the next three years starting the next fiscal year. $282 million will be invested in water infrastructures in urban areas and $139 million to be invested in water infrastructures in rural areas,” she said.

She said that by 2022 all water treatment plants will have been completed.



Aimé Muzola, the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Water and Sanitation Corporation (WASAC) , aid the water treatment plants will be constructed in two phases.



“There are about new eight plants to be constructed. The first phase includes Gihira water treatment plant to be completed by June next year. Other plants will be built under the second phase as we are (still) conducting studies. The last water treatment plant will have been completed by 2022,” he said.



Among the water treatment plants that are expected to increase supply to rural areas include the one at Ngoma River in Nyagatare and another at Lake Muhazi to supply water in Gatsibo and Kayonza districts.



Officials said that the plant at Lake Sake will also be constructed to supply water to parts of Ngoma District while other plants will be built in Karongi District, Mugaga area to supply water to Muhanga town, Busogwe area to supply water to different parts of the southern province and the plant in Rusizi District.



They are all projected to supply a combined 61,500 cubic metres of water in rural Rwanda.



He said that establishing water treatment plants will be implemented alongside new water supply systems and rehabilitating old ones.



Similar projects are being implemented in secondary cities such as Musanze, Rubavu, Rusizi, Muhanga, Huye and Nyagatare.



Explaining water tariffs



According to Patrick Nyirishema, the Director General of RURA, Rwandans should use water efficiently in order to control the bills they pay.



He said residents pay only 26.2 per cent of the actual cost of water supply in their homes as the government covers 73.8 per cent through subsidized investments.



The current water tariffs were set on February 1, 2019.



Nyirishema explained that the clients are grouped in three categories.



The 1st category comprises of people who use not less than 5,000 litres (250 jelly cans) per month or eight jerrycans per day. This category pays Rwf340 per 1,000 litres or Rwf6.8 per one jerrycan.



The second category is composed of those who use over 5,000 litres but not more than 20,000 litres per month. This category pays Rwf720 per 1,000 litres, meaning Rwf14.4 per one 20-litre jerrycan.



The third category includes those using 20,000 litres and not more than 50,000 litres per month which is between 33 and 83 litres per day. This category pays Rwf845 per 1,000 litres which is Rwf16.9 per one jerrycan.

At least 65 people have died in Rwanda after heavy rains damaged houses and washed away bridges, according to officials.

The country has, in recent weeks, been hit by torrential downpours that have led to floods and landslides that crushed homes built on mountain slopes, with similar scenes playing out across East Africa.

In a statement on Thursday, Rwanda’s Ministry of Emergency Management said major rains the night before were the worst in months and caused “a number of disasters” in seven districts: Gakenke, Nyabihu, Muhanga, Musanze, Ngororero, Rulindo and Rubavu.

“Up until midnight, 65 death cases had been registered due to floods. The rains also led to damage of infrastructure like roads, 91 houses, 5 bridges and several farms were swept away by the floods,” said the statement.

The toll follows the deaths of eight people in heavy rains on Friday and Saturday, the ministry added.

Countries across East Africa have experienced major downpours in recent weeks, with devastating effects for the local populations.

In neighbouring Kenya, floods and landslides have killed nearly 200 people in the past month, while Uganda’s Lake Victoria has overflown, submerging houses, a hospital and bridges and displacing thousands.

Four teenagers drowned in Kenya on Thursday after a river burst its banks, a day after the government announced 194 people had been killed due to floods and landslides since the rainy season began in April, and large areas of farmland and water infrastructure destroyed.

Uganda’s President Yoweri Museveni on Thursday wrote on Twitter that Lake Victoria was near record levels.

Sitting in the doorway of her residential house in the remote Murundi Sector, Kayonza District in Eastern Province, Verena Uwineza is sorting beans for evening meal on a traditional basket.

It is Monday, September 12. By most accounts, everybody has been affected by prolonged drought in this area.

The mother of two is one of more than 47,300 households bearing the brunt of drought that has hit the country, with Kayonza and Nyagatare districts in Eastern Province most affected.

Crops wither under the scorching sun as they try to grow their sprouts.

Cows die or produce less milk because of lack of forage and water because of drought which left grass and dams dry.

About 1,750 cows in Nyagatare District died last year due to lack of fodder and water, according to Gahiga Gashumba, the chairperson of National Dairy Farmers Federation of Rwanda (NDFFR).

Cattle prices in the affected areas of the Eastern Province plummeted from between Rwf400,000 and Rw250,000 to between Rwf80,000 and Rwf50,000, accounts from the locals suggest.

Some water that would be used to irrigate rice on estimated 1,000 hectares of land was released to save cattle, according to the Ministry of Agriculture and Animal Resources.

An assessment conducted by the ministry in Eastern Province revealed that between September 2015 and June this year, drought affected crops on 16,119 hectares of land in Kayonza District, 6,619 hectares in Nyagatare District and 750 hectares in Kirehe District.

The drought extended to 2017 Agriculture Season A.

According to the ministry, it is the first time such a drought has occurred in the country in the last 60 years.

Indeed, the severe effects of drought, owing to climate change, have weighed down the efforts of farmers, hence threatening food security.

This has left Uwineza, like many other residents, needing the Government’s food support for sustenance. The food rations are of beans and maize.

The residents say they did not harvest anything from their gardens last season, while they also lost large quantities of crops in the previous two seasons.

Uwineza said during favourable farming season, one could get Rwf1,000 per day in return for daily farm labour, but noted that the amount has since dropped to Rwf700 because of dry season.

“Even with that income, one can hardly get where to buy food after crop production failed owing to drought,” Uwineza told The New Times from her residence, adding that the food support they get from the Government is their lifeline.

Afisa Nyiraneza, a resident of Murundi Sector in Kayonza District, said she has been growing cassava, beans and Irish potatoes but drought has wrecked her efforts as her crops withered.

She is also the beneficiary of the Government’s food support that comes under the food for work framework, whereby the beneficiary does public works and gets food – consisting of maize and beans.

Nyiraneza’s family has been receiving 33 kilogrammes – 21 for maize and 11 for beans – per week.

“We have no other source of food as this area has been ravaged by drought. If it was not for this food aid, things would be worse,” the 33-year-old mother of five told The New Times.

“The public works are in line with encouraging people to work for common development instead of being spoon-fed,” she added.

The “Climate Change And Food Security: Risks And Responses” report published by Food and Agriculture Organisation in 2016, stated that “the effects of climate change on our ecosystems are already severe and widespread, and ensuring food security in the face of climate change is among the most daunting challenges facing humankind.”

Water provision for cows

Gashumba, the chairperson of NDFFR, said the water reservoirs for cows easily dry up during dry season and that though dams are being built, reliance on rainwater to refill the dams is not sustainable with prolonged drought.

“There is a need to pump water, mainly from the Akagera River so that it can be used by dairy farmers,” he said.

Dr Théogène Rutagwenda, the director-general for animal resources at the Ministry of Agriculture, cited several government initiatives to mitigate the drought impact.

These include construction of valley dams, whereby six have already been built in Nyagatare District, six in Kayonza District and one in Gatsibo District.

Each dam has capacity to contain 40,000 cubic metres of water.

Rutagwenda, who is also the chairperson of the Task Force on Response to Drought and Food Shortage, said, among other interventions, efforts are in place to pump Akagera River water to channel it into cattle troughs in Rwimiyaga Sector of Nyagatare District.

Need for grass growing and storage

Dr Théogène Rutagwenda, the director-general for animal resources at the Ministry of Agriculture, said they are advising livestock farmers to grow two nutritious perennial grass species; Chloris gayana and penicum maximum, for energy provision.

Also, two legume species of lucerne and lablab rich in protein for cows is being grown on fields in the province.

“These feeds can be given to cows while fresh and once they are dry, they can be harvested and stored,” he said.

Gashumba, of NDFFR, noted that farmers need subsidy for machines or equipment to compress and fasten grass for proper storage and use during drought season.

Modeste Rudahikwa, a dairy farmer in Kayonza, said the drought has affected his milk production. His cows produce only 10 litres of milk per day compared to 80 litres he used to get from the same 16 cows per day previously.

Rudahikwa said the new system of growing fodder and storing it as well as have enough and constant supply of water in dams for cows is essential.

Systematic irrigation as a means to tackle drought

Last week, the Rwanda Meteorology Agency announced that in the September-December period, there will be normal and below normal rain (from 450mm to less than 350mm) in Eastern Province and other parts of the country based on prediction data.

Farmers in the east said they expect to get good harvest in December if they receive enough rainfall.

The Ministry of Agriculture,, Rwanda Agriculture Board (RAB) and farmers consider sustainable and systematic irrigation the best and long-term solution to drought as reliance on rain-fed farming is not sustainable.

Speaking to The New Times on Wednesday, Innocent Nzeyimana, head of land husbandry, irrigation and mechanisation at RAB, said 15,000 hectares of land will be irrigated from this year unti 2018 in Eastern Province.

Parts of the three districts of Kayonza, Nyagatare and Gatsibo that were worst affected by drought host swathes of Akagera National Park.

“We are thinking of the feasibility of a project to take water there from Akagera River. That project should be comprehensive enough to address the issue of irrigation, water for cattle and domestic use in a bid to tackle the drought issue in a sustainable way in the three districts of Kayonza, Nyagatare and Gatsibo,” Nzeyimana said, adding that consultants are being looked for to study the project that might start by 2018.

Currently, irrigated land in the country stands at 45,000 hectares, about 30,000 of which is in the Eastern Province.

Nzeyimana said the Government targets to irrigate up to 100,000 hectares of land by 2020.

Dr Vincent Biruta, the minister for natural resources, said during a High Level Event for Establishing a Climate Application and Prediction Centre for Central Africa on Monday in Kigali that Rwanda has recently experienced a temperature increase of 1.4°C since 1970, higher than the global average, and can expect an increase in temperature of up to 2.5°C by 2050.

Rwanda is making arrangements to deliver food assistance to support more than 3,000 families in the Eastern Province who need urgent assistance to combat the worst effects of a prolonged drought.

According to the Ministry of Agriculture and Animal Resources’ (Minagri), despite other parts of the country recording good harvests in season A this year, which is currently ending, numerous households in Eastern Province have been left stranded with little or no harvests, putting them at a risk of hunger.

An ongoing assessment by Minagri has so far identified over 3,000 families in five sectors of Kayonza district, and over 2,500 families across seven cells in Kirehe district that are in need of food support due to a poor harvest.

The assessment has also identified five sectors in Nyagatare district, where farmers will not harvest at all, and therefore need immediate food support. The Eastern Province is more prone to drought than other parts of the country.

Food supplies

Government officials said the affected areas were mainly those left out of a multimillion irrigation programme supported by the World Bank, which saw different parts of Eastern Province previously prone to drought transform into food baskets.

“We are finalising the mapping of those areas that will require food supplies to avert a possible food shortage,” said Jean Claude Murenzi, the Mayor of Kayonza district.

Over the past five years, parts of Eastern Province have faced a shortage of rainfall, putting thousands of households at risk of hunger.

Minister of agriculture and animal resources Geraldine Mukeshimana said the ministry is working closely with local government authorities to ensure food supplies get to needy families on time.

“Even though we are still waiting for the harvest season to end, we already have 14,000MT of supplies in storage, which we can rely on to support families in Nyagatare district. We also have other storage facilities across the country,” said Ms Mukeshimana.

The mapped areas that require food intervention are Ndego, Murama, Kabarondo, Mwiri, Kabare and Rwinkwavu sectors of Kayonza and Nyarubuye, Kigano, Nasho, Mpanga, Nyamugari and cells in Kirehe districts.

The ministry said agricultural production has dramatically increased in other parts of the country, which means food supplies will be mobilised internally.

The rise in output is attributed to more cultivated land across the country and scaling up of agro-inputs.

Figures from Minagri show that this season 585,400MT of beans are expected from 354,900ha; 66,014MT of rice from 13,728ha; while cassava production will reach 703,909MT cultivated on 44,128ha.

Despite the armyworm invasion last year, maize production is also expected to do well with production set at 775,000MT from 258,139ha.","By LEONCE MUVUNYIRwanda is making arrangements to deliver food assistance to support more than 3,000 families in the Eastern Province who need urgent assistance to combat the worst effects of a prolonged drought.

685,https://www.wvi.org/stories/rwanda/access-clean-water-keeping-chantal-safe-during-covid-19-period,Access to clean water is keeping Chantal safe during the COVID-19 period,"Chantal Umutoni, 34, lives in Kigeme refugee camp with her husband and two sisters. She came to Rwanda with her family from the Democratic Republic of Congo in 2012 due to the insecurity that was there. They left Congo with nothing, in fear of being harmed on the way because they were not allowed to move to neighboring countries. They stayed in Ntamira transit center and later were moved to Kigeme refugee camp.

Chantal appreciates World Vision for coming to their rescue through the provision of clean water, which was a big challenge to them. They spent many hours in search of water, which was dirty and contaminated. When World Vision provided clean water to the camp, their prayers were answered. “Having enough toilets and bathrooms in the camp has helped us; initially we had few toilets in the camp but now we have enough,” adds Chantal. The provision of toilets and bathrooms improved hygiene in the camp and thus reduction of poor sanitation related diseases.

Elizabeth 15, Chantal’s sister, states that World Vision is also giving them an education through paying school fees and scholastic materials for children in the camp.

“World Vision has done great things for us. They taught us how to wash hands during this COVID-19 period and also provided access to water. We did not give value to hand washing because we felt that washing hands at home was enough,” adds Elizabeth.

Chantal and her family cannot narrate their story without stressing how World Vision intervened in the prevention of COVID-19.

Chantal(center) poses for a photo with her little sisters in front of a shop at Kigeme refugee camp

World Vision provided handwashing stations at all the entry points of the camp, meeting points like shops and places where camp dwellers collect their allowances and the same rule of social distancing is followed. Sensitization of people on the causes and symptoms of COVID-19 is done in the camps and Chantal says that this has helped them understand how to protect themselves against Coronavirus.

“World Vision helped us to learn how to wash our hands. We now wash our hands frequently, which was not the case before. We have more handwashing stations and they are easily accessible in the camp and even at the entrance,” Chantal said.

Chantal also noted that during this COVID-19 period, some volunteers were stationed at every water point to help the people ensure social distancing. Sometimes when there are many people at the water collection point, there is a person to help fill their jerrycans and they just collect them in an effort to avoid crowding the water point.

Refugee camps may be vulnerable to infectious diseases and the spread of diseases is rapid due to the set up of the camps. Kigeme Refugee camp is located in Nyamagabe district in the southern province of Rwanda. It has 4,004 households and a population of 21,181 people who, like Chantal, all have access to clean water and are keeping safe during this period of COVID-19 through World Vision support.","They stayed in Ntamira transit center and later were moved to Kigeme refugee camp.

On the day of assessment, all HCFs had power and 15 of 17 had running water on site, with plumbing that reached each service of the HCF. Twelve HCFs had power provided by the national utility and five HCFs had working solar panels. Eleven HCFs had piped water on site supplied by the national utility (treated surface water). The remaining six HCFs had piped water on site from a local water source (untreated water from protected and unprotected springs) (Table 1). Nine of the 17 HCFs were located in the Eastern Province, and eight were in the Northern Province. Staff at the HCFs located in the Eastern Province reported that seasonal water shortages were common during the dry season – approximately June to September. In the Northern and Western Provinces, where annual rainfall typically exceeds 1200 mm/year [26], water shortages were reported to be infrequent (no more than once per month and less than 1 day in duration). Fifteen of 17 HCFs had rainwater catchment systems that ranged in volume from 5 m3 to 100 m3 (Table 1).

Table 1 General water and power characteristics of 17 rural healthcare facilities in Rwanda, assessments conducted in 2011 and 2012 Full size table

Drinking water treatment

Staff responsible for WASH at 15 of the 17 HCFs (88%) reported using some type of point-of-use water treatment method for drinking water. Piped water was reported as the primary source of water treated for drinking at all sites. When this source was unavailable, HCF staff reported treating rainwater for drinking. At six of 17 HCFs (35%) chlorine solution (SûrEau brand) was used for drinking water treatment, and ceramic filters (2 or 4 filters, 8 L capacity) were used at four of 17 HCF for drinking water treatment. At four of 17 HCFs (24%) both chlorine solution and ceramic filters were used. At one of 17 HCFs (6%) staff reported boiling water, and staff at two of 17 HCFs (12%) indicated that water was not treated before provision for drinking. The eight HCFs included in both the rapid and baseline evaluations had the same responses for drinking water treatment practices in both 2011 and 2012. (Table 1).

Staff responsible for WASH at all 17 HCF indicated that drinking water, in general, was available to anyone who wanted it. However, at all sites where drinking water was available on the day of assessment (ten sites during rapid screening assessments and eight during baseline assessments) it was observed that water was treated in the pharmacy via ceramic filters or addition of chlorine solution, and treated drinking water was available in limited quantities of up to 20 L per day.

Water quality

In the rapid screening assessment conducted in May–June 2011, tap water was available to sample at 14 of 15 HCFs, and drinking water was available to sample at 10 of 15 HCFs.

The results from 14 tap water samples and 10 treated drinking water samples are included in the final data analysis for chlorine residual. The microbiological results for two tap water samples and two treated drinking water samples were excluded from the final analysis because the amount of time between sample collection and analysis exceeded the time defined in standard methods. One of 12 tap water samples (8%) and four of eight treated water samples (50%) met the WHO guideline of <1 total coliform per 100 mL (Fig. 1). Nine of 12 tap water samples (75%) and 7 of 8 treated drinking water samples (88%) met the WHO guideline of <1 E. coli per 100 mL (Fig. 2). No tap water sample (0 of 14) and only one of ten treated drinking water samples (10%) met the WHO guideline of free chlorine residual ≥0.2 mg/L (Fig. 3) despite the fact that staff at 10 of 14 HCFs with water available reported treatment of drinking water with chlorine solution (Table 1).

In the baseline assessment conducted in December 2012, tap water and drinking water were available to sample at eight of 10 HCFs. Two of eight tap water samples (25%) and two of eight treated water samples (25%) met the WHO guideline of <1 total coliform per 100 mL (Fig. 1). Seven of eight tap water samples (88%) and all treated drinking water samples (8 of 8) met the WHO guideline of <1 E. coli per 100 mL (Fig. 2). One of eight tap water samples (13%) and two of eight treated drinking water samples (25%) met the WHO guideline of free chlorine residual ≥0.2 mg/L (Fig. 3) even though staff at seven of eight HCFs with water available reported using chlorine solution (Table 1).

Water access within the healthcare facility

Baseline assessments were conducted in December 2012 at 10 sites. Each HCF assessed had several types of water access points: there were 181 sinks with taps within the HCFs’ services and at toilets; the number ranged from six to 30 per site (Table 2). The number of sinks at each HCF was in part determined by the number of different buildings housing the various services at the HCF and the extent of plumbing to each building. There were 33 tippy taps (non-networked hand washing locations with a water container and a tap) located primarily at latrines (ranging from one to eight per HCF). Outdoors, in common areas of the HCFs, there were 44 rainwater tanks with taps (ranging from one to eight per HCF) and a small number of outdoor taps (nine outdoor taps across six HCFs) (Table 2).

Table 2 Functionality of water access points in 10 rural healthcare facilities in Rwanda, December 2012 Full size table

At all HCFs, certain sinks with taps were dedicated for staff use only, including those in the laboratory, pharmacy, administration, consultation, and maternity services. There were sinks with taps in the hospitalization service wards for inpatients at all HCFs. There were sinks with taps located at toilets, and tippy taps at latrines, that were accessible to patients and visitors unless the toilet/latrine was dedicated for staff use only. The water access points located in outdoor common areas that were accessible to patients and visitors were outdoor taps and rainwater tanks with taps. In total, 40% of the water access points were not functioning on the day of inspection (Table 2). One third of taps at sinks were in various states of disrepair; with the predominant problem being leaks that were managed by turning off the water supply to the tap. Lack of water elsewhere was due to empty tippy taps and lack of handles on outdoor taps and rainwater tank taps. Staff responsible for WASH at four of the ten HCF reported that they had intentionally removed the handles as a measure to manage water use.

Hand hygiene infrastructure

Available hand hygiene infrastructure (water access points used for hand washing) included sinks with taps, outdoor taps, and tippy taps. Rainwater tanks with taps were not identified by HCF staff as part of hand hygiene infrastructure and were therefore excluded. Sinks with taps were the most common form of hand hygiene infrastructure; there were 119 working sinks with taps, ranging from four to 25 per HCF (Table 2). Soap was provided at 39 of the 119 working sinks with taps (33%) ranging from zero (0%) to 12 (75%) per HCF (Table 3). Provision of soap at tippy taps was observed at two out of ten HCFs. No soap was provided at outdoor taps at any HCF. The availability of soap ranged from no soap at any hand washing locations in the HCF, to soap at 12 out of 17 (71%) hand washing locations (Table 3).

Table 3 Availability of soap and water for hand washing in 10 rural healthcare facilities in Rwanda, 2012 Full size table

Although soap was observed at few hand washing locations, nine out of ten HCF directors reported that there were sufficient funds to purchase soap for hand washing, The HCF staff responsible for WASH at six of ten HCF reported that it was difficult to provide soap because of misuse or theft by the HCF visitors. Provision of hand sanitizing rub was not observed at any HCF.

Toilets and latrines

All HCFs assessed had toilets and/or latrines for staff, patients and visitors. Toilets were flush toilets with pedestals and squat plates; latrines were pit latrines and improved ventilated pit latrines. There were a total of 47 toilets and 62 latrines at the ten HCF, ranging from 6 to 15 toilets and/or latrines per site (Table 4). Two thirds of toilets were in use, and 53% of latrines were in use and in hygienic condition (defined as absence of two or more of the following characteristics: visible feces, flies, strong odor before entering the facility). The average combined proportion of toilets and latrines that were in use and in hygienic condition per HCF was 59% and ranged from 25 to 100% per site (Table 4). The majority, 30 out of 33 (91%), of latrines that were in use and in hygienic condition were accessible for use by patients and visitors. At nine out of ten HCFs, at least one flush toilet was dedicated for staff use only and was usually kept locked; among the toilets at HCFs that were in use and in hygienic condition, 18 out of 31 (58%) were available to patients and visitors and the remaining 13 out of 31 (42%) were reserved for staff only (Table 4).

Table 4 State of toilets and latrines in 10 rural healthcare facilities in Rwanda, 2012 Full size table

HCF staff roles and responsibilities

Core, non-clinical staff at the HCFs included Environmental Health Officers (EHOs) among whose responsibilities are infection control, waste disposal and WASH. In 2013, the Ministry of Health reported 227 EHOs: approximately one EHO for every two HCF and one EHO per 48,000 people [11]. HCFs in Rwanda have at least one maintenance worker, a hygienist, who is responsible for cleaning the facility and managing water use. Under supervision from the EHO and clinical staff, hygienists treat drinking water, provide soap and water for hand washing, clean toilets and latrines, and manage HCF waste disposal. Among the HCFs evaluated, there was one EHO and two or more hygienists at each site. EHOs at all HCFs reported that 20 L of treated drinking water were prepared each day and that latrines and toilets were cleaned at least once per day. These activities were not documented in writing in a register or other format, rather, EHOs reported that they managed these activities and reported problems to the director when necessary. Roofs and rain gutters were reported to be cleaned once per year. None of the HCFs had on-site capacity or basic tools for servicing electrical systems or plumbing: any electrical or plumbing repairs, such as leaking taps, were contracted to outside technicians. HCFs used local private services to empty latrine pits. Distribution of toilet paper in patient/public use sanitation facilities was limited due to concern about misuse or theft. A commonly reported sanitation maintenance problem was blocked toilets and pipes.

Record keeping and reporting

Record keeping associated with WASH infrastructure was limited to a requisition form for soap, toilet paper, and detergent that was managed by HCF accountants. No records were kept of water availability or drinking water treatment, nor sanitary facility cleaning or repair. HCF accountants were responsible for procuring water treatment products, soap, toilet paper, and other cleaning agents for HCF hygiene, and paying utility bills. No HCF reported that they had outstanding water or power bills.

There was external monitoring of water and sanitation at the HCF through the Government of Rwanda Performance-Based Financing System (PBF). At the time of data collection, the PBF evaluation was conducted quarterly and included observation of on-site piped water and drinking water in the pharmacy. District-level oversight systems also included observation of whether there was a ceramic filter for water treatment in the pharmacy [27]. District-level evaluations were conducted at the same time as the PBF evaluation. These evaluations were conducted by team of District-level hospital staff including District EHOs and results were reported to the Ministry of Health at District and central levels.","The results from 14 tap water samples and 10 treated drinking water samples are included in the final data analysis for chlorine residual.

Heavy rains that pounded for hours yesterday were felt in a number of the parts of Kigali city, one of the affected areas being Gisozi-Gakiriro area where the waters flooded the road connecting to the Nyarutarama-Kagugu road causing a hitch in transport for pedestrians and motorists and bikes.

Rwanda Meteorological Agency (RMA) had earlier on predicted heavy rains and strong winds in Rwanda's West, South and East during the period of transiting from January to February.

Yesterday, in many parts of Kigali, it continuously rained from about lunch time till dark, while in other parts it had started raining at dawn.

Even long after it had subsided however, the flooding persisted in different parts of the city, causing paralysis.

In Gisozi, one of the most affected areas, the rain waters flooded the road that links to the Nyarutarama-Kagugu road, derailing transport for a number of people, damaged crops, but also created a spectacle a number of residents of the area who stood by to gaze at the distress created by the rains.

A hard time for pedestrians, a heyday for motorists and bicycle riders

Many road users, mostly returning from work and school hustled to wade through the water, and some had to take off their shoes and pull their clothes higher to cross to the other side.

On the other hand, there were many motorists and bicycle riders who had chance to make a quick buck from those who could not cross by themselves, helping them cross for pay.

An eye witness told The New Times that people had to pay Rwf100 to bicycle riders to take them across for a ride of almost 10 metres.

Other well-wishers however, chose to just lend a hand freely to the vulnerable, who wanted to cross.

“I am here to freely help women and school children who want to cross and go home. I don’t do it for money. When I see someone in need of help to cross, I offer them some help,” said Joseph Sinayobye, a resident of Gisozi.

By the time we spoke to him, he said he had helped about five people to cross – women and school children.

Likewise, a number of personal cars were seen offering to carry some people across,

“Some cars have been offering lifts to people just to take them across to the other side,” said the eye witness.

In its Monday weather alert, the weatherman predicted heavy rains between 25 and 50 millimeters from the evening of 27th to 28th January and 31st January to 1st February, especially in the districts that border Nyungwe Forest in the Western and Southern provinces.

694,https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/water/brief/wash-water-sanitation-hygiene-and-covid-19,"WASH (Water, Sanitation & Hygiene) and COVID-19","Context

Safely managed water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) services are an essential part of preventing and protecting human health during infectious disease outbreaks, including the current COVID-19 pandemic. One of the most cost-effective strategies for increasing pandemic preparedness, especially in resource-constrained settings, is investing in core public health infrastructure, including water and sanitation systems. Good WASH and waste management practices, that are consistently applied, serve as barriers to human-to-human transmission of the COVID-19 virus in homes, communities, health care facilities, schools, and other public spaces.

Safely managed WASH services are also critical during the recovery phase of a disease outbreak to mitigate secondary impacts on community livelihoods and wellbeing. These secondary impacts—which could include disruptions to supply chains, inability to pay bills, or panic-buying—have negative impacts on the continuity and quality of water and sanitation services, the ability of affected households to access and pay for WASH services and products (for instance, soap, point of use water treatment or menstrual hygiene products) and the ability of schools, workplaces and other public spaces to maintain effective hygiene protocols when they re-open. If not managed, secondary impacts can increase the risk of further spreading water borne diseases, including potential disease outbreaks such as cholera, particularly where the disease is endemic.

According to a WHO/UNICEF technical brief on WASH and waste management for COVID-19:

Frequent and proper hand hygiene is one of the most important measures that can be used to prevent infection with the COVID-19 virus. WASH services should enable more frequent and regular hand hygiene by improving facilities and using proven behavior change techniques.

WHO guidance on the safe management of drinking water and sanitation services applies to the COVID-19 outbreak. Measures that go above and beyond these recommendations are not needed.

Many co-benefits will be realized by safely managing WASH services and applying good hygiene practices. Such efforts will prevent other infectious diseases, which cause millions of deaths each year.

Beyond the human tragedy, devastating economics impacts are anticipated in all countries and for the most vulnerable and marginalized people in society. Human and economic costs are likely to be larger for Fragile, Conflict, and Violence (FCV)-affected countries and lower and middle-income countries, that generally have limited coverage and capacity of water supply and sanitation systems, lower health care capacity, larger informal sectors, shallower financial markets, limited fiscal space, and poorer governance. As such, for all interventions it will be especially important to target FCV-affected countries—home to about two-thirds of the world’s extreme poor. While it is too early and with too many variables to quantify the economic costs of the pandemic, the costs of inaction would be catastrophic.

Priority Areas

Action in the WASH sector is therefore critical for both containing the virus and lowering its immediate impact and aftermath. Three priority areas are identified as part of the emergency response:

Safe WASH services in health care facilities (HCFs) to deliver quality health services; protect patients, health workers, and staff; and to prevent further transmission. The WASH in Health Care Facilities Global Baseline Report (JMP, 2019) highlighted that one in four HCFs lacks basic water service (affecting more than 900 million people), one in five HCFs has no sanitation service (affecting about 1.5 billion people), and one in six HCFs has no hygiene service. During an infectious disease outbreak, services should meet minimum quality standards and should be separated for infected vs. non-infected patients. Support should ensure services are not disrupted and products such as soap and alcohol-based hand rubs are available. These services should also be available in temporary HCFs and quarantine sites. Improving handwashing behavior, food hygiene, and safe water practices. Materials for handwashing and hygiene may include provision of fixed and portable handwashing facilities, purchase of soap and alcohol-based hand rubs, provision of water supplies for handwashing, and point of use water treatment. Schools, workplaces, markets, transport stations, and other areas where people gather all require easy access to handwashing facilities and water and soap for handwashing. Proven behavior change techniques can help increase the frequency and improve the practice of critical hygiene behaviors. Resources such as the Global Handwashing Partnership can be tapped to mobilize private, public, and civil society actors to support developing messaging and materials to respond to COVID-19 outbreaks in country. Emergency support to secure and extend water and sanitation service provision, including:

Rapid and low-cost water service and sanitation provision for communities, health care facilities, and schools is critical to enable handwashing, hygiene, and disinfection. According to UN Habitat, COVID-19 will hit the world’s most vulnerable people the most, many of whom live in informal settlements and rural community settings. Providing quick, just-in-time community water access points/water kiosks (including provision of soap) in unserved urban and rural areas, and for unserved HCFs and schools is critical. This could include: (i) provision and operation of compact water treatment plants; (ii) construction and operation of water points and sanitation facilities to deliver water in strategic urban or rural points; and/or (iii) provision and operation of trucks for water delivery (bottled, sachets) and water tankers, including adequate water storage to service operators.

Support to water supply and sanitation (WSS) service providers to prepare emergency plans and ensure continuity of service delivery through inter alia: provision of water treatment chemicals and spare parts, availability of fuel for pumps and treatment, maintaining staffing levels, providing protective equipment for utility staff and salary supplements to compensate for the additional work-loads.

WASH Interventions for An Effective COVID-19 Pandemic Response

To respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, the World Bank Water Global Practice has developed a menu of solutions, including concrete actions to help our client governments in their preparedness and emergency response, and future resilience to similar epidemics.

Preparedness and emergency response: Support affected, at-risk and low-capacity countries to secure Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) in health facilities and communities.

Safe water supply, sanitation and hygiene services and medical waste management in health care facilities are essential to deliver quality health services, protect patients, health workers and staff, and to prevent further transmission. During an infectious disease outbreak, services should meet minimum quality standards and be separated for infected vs. non-infected patients. Support is required to ensure that services are not disrupted and products such as soap and alcohol-based hand rubs are available. Temporary health care facilities and quarantine sites also need to provide these services. Communication and preparedness related to handwashing behavior change and promotion, food hygiene and safe water practices. Materials for handwashing and hygiene may include the provision of fixed and portable handwashing facilities, purchasing of soap and alcohol-based hand rubs, provision of water supplies for handwashing and point of use water treatment. Schools, workplaces, markets, transport stations and other areas where people gather all require easy access to water and soap for handwashing. Proven behavior change techniques can help increase the frequency and improve the practice of critical hygiene behaviors. Resources such as the Global Handwashing Partnership can be tapped to mobilize private, public and civil society actors to support the development of messaging and materials to respond to COVID-19 outbreaks in various countries. Rapid, low-cost water service provision for communities, health care facilities and schools that currently lack access to a reliable and safe water supply is critical to enable handwashing, hygiene and disinfection. Providing quick, just-in-time community water access points/water kiosks (potentially including provision of soap) in unserved urban and rural areas, and for unserved health care facilities and schools. This would include: (i) provision and operation of compact water treatment plants; (ii) construction and operation of water points to deliver water in strategic urban or rural points; (iii) provision and operation of trucks for water delivery (bottled, sachets) and water tankers, including adequate water storage to service operators. Emergency support to water and sanitation utilities to ensure the continuity of water supplies, enhanced monitoring, staffing levels and spare parts. Additional emergency measures include ensuring that water utility staff have protective equipment, priority for testing, and salary supplements to compensate for the additional workload and risk. Emergency response to Fragility, Conflict, and Violence countries: The main principle of an emergency WASH response is to ensure the consideration of water supply, sanitation and hygiene factors at the site selection and planning stages, while also coordinating the response closely with physical planning, public health and environmental stakeholders. The response must adhere to the multi-sectoral needs assessment for refugee emergencies (NARE), followed by a more detailed initial WASH rapid assessment of local WASH-related resources in relation to the need/demand.2 This includes an assessment of water resources (quantity and quality) for water sources and distribution options.

Mitigating secondary impacts: WASH services and products are essential for well-functioning health care facilities and to avoid disrupting community livelihoods and wellbeing.

Financial support to water and sanitation utilities to monitor and support cash reserves, the availability of water and wastewater treatment chemicals, the availability of electricity fuel for pumping and treating water, staffing levels and routine/capital maintenance. Providing technical assistance to governments to strengthen country systems including: (i) ‘agile’ service delivery mechanisms that may turn to local private sector entities to deliver safe water through ‘turnkey’ solutions under design-build-operate (DBO) contracts; (ii) enhanced water quality assurance/monitoring; (iii) preparation of utility emergency plans (absenteeism may be a serious risk); (iv) safely managing wastewater and fecal sludge; (v) emptying latrines and safely disposing excreta; (vi) monitoring secondary impacts. Financial support to beneficiaries to ensure the continuity of WASH services including financing for fee waivers to mitigate service disruption for households and institutions (schools, health care centers, government agencies, etc.). Ensure funding for WASH services and related products (soap, etc.) are included in Social Protection operations targeting poorer households. In fragile countries that lack social safety nets and wherein fiduciary arrangements do not allow for DPOs, in-kind distributions to vulnerable populations identified as most at risk (e.g. distribution hygiene and cleaning kits, water distribution, etc.). Ensuring the viability of critical supply chains such as for hygiene product availability in markets (e.g. soap, disinfectant, point of use water treatment supplies etc.), as well as import/export restrictions on critical equipment needed by utilities or households.

Building resilience against future diseases: Safely managed WASH services are needed to support affected, at-risk, and low-capacity countries to build resilience against future pandemics, as well as against diseases that afflict the poor in the developing world on a more routine basis, such as diarrhea. In 2016, the WHO estimated that poor WASH practices were responsible for 829,000 deaths from diarrheal disease – equivalent to 1.9% of the global burden of disease. Cholera, an acute diarrheal disease linked to contaminated water that can kill within hours if left untreated, infects up to 4 million people each year, and kills an estimated 21,000-143,000 people. The spread of other diseases, like typhoid and measles, increase precipitously in the developing world when domestic water supply outages occur. In some individuals these diseases are fatal, and in many others their burden leads to reduced labor productivity and wages. Where the burden is high, repeated illnesses for family members can trap households in a vicious poverty cycle.

The provision of safely managed WASH services. Basic WASH services and medical waste management in health care facilities are essential for safe and quality care. Basic water supply, sanitation and hygiene services in schools are essential for safe and quality care. Strengthening multi-sector, national institutions and platforms for policy development and the coordination of prevention and preparedness, including for anti-microbial resistance.

The Government of Rwanda has just released 100 billion Rwandan dollars (98.4 million euros) for the construction of the infrastructure, which will be built in the Nyagatare District in the north-east of the country.

The Rwandan Water and Forestry Authority (RWFA) has already launched the first phase of the project. It concerns the displacement of the populations living on the right-of-way of the future dam. According to the RWFA, the resettlement phase of the population is expected to be completed by the end of 2019. The feasibility study for the project was carried out by Korea Water Resources Corporation (K-Water) and Yooshin Engineering, both Korean companies. This phase was funded by the Korean International Cooperation Agency (KOICA) and the Rwanda Natural Resources Authority (RNRA).

A key project for north-eastern Rwanda

North-eastern Rwanda is affected by drought, which reduces the flow of the Muvumba River, which also flows through Uganda. According to the RWFA, the office in charge of the project, the construction of the Muvumba water reservoir will regulate the flow of this watercourse.

The construction company will build a 38 m high and 1.2 km wide dam and a 5.56 km2 reservoir capable of holding more than 73 million m3 of water. This dam will retain rainwater that often causes flooding in the region.

With an installed capacity of 2.9 MW, the electricity produced by the dam will be distributed to 28,000 households. The dam will also provide drinking water to more than 118,000 people by 2035, according to RWFA projections. For its agricultural component, the Mvumba project integrates irrigation works on 13,000 hectares throughout the Eastern Province, known for its cereal production, particularly rice and maize. More than 50,000 farmers will benefit, mainly in Tabagwe, Karama, Gatunda and Rwimiyaga. These are communities that have been severely affected by drought in recent years. This resulted in the loss of 23,448 hectares of crops and the death of 1,750 cows in the 2015-2016 fiscal year, according to KT Press.

Tetero said residents from Karangazi, Rwimiyaga and Nyagatare sectors will access to piped domestic water from the dam.

In addition to supplying water for irrigating 7,380 hectares of farmland, the dam is expected to supply water for 16 reservoirs including the eight existing valley dams and eight new ones for livestock.

It is also projected to produce at least 5719 MWH annually.

Claudian Mushabe, the Mayor of Nyagatare District said that the dam will provide support to the district farmers who are affected by drought most of the time.

""We have sectors that suffer because they lack irrigation schemes. So many livestock farmers have been losing their cows due to lack of water while some of the households still do not have access to clean water. Having more dams is the solutions to those who lack food due to drought,"" he said.

Eastern Province has been hit by drought for many years.

For instance, in the 2015/2016 fiscal year drought affected 47,306 families as 23,448 hectares of crops were destroyed while 1,750 cows in died in Nyagatare, Gatsibo, Kayonza, Kirehe and Ngoma districts

Last year, the national irrigation targets were revised due to the high costs associated with constructing irrigation schemes.","The Rwf100 billion project is expected to increase the supply of pipped water in Eastern Province, reduce power shortages and bolster food output by providing water for irrigation.
""The project will construct a dam of 30.5m high and will have capacity to reserve 35 million cubic meter of water for irrigation, drinking water and small hydropower.
The project will also protect erosion around the dam by applying terraces, planting trees, agro-forestry trees and other anti-erosion techniques.

On World Water Day, World Vision recognizes the life-saving importance of clean water. And this year, we’re committing to bringing access to clean water to all World Vision program areas in Rwanda by the end of 2022, and to everyone, everywhere we work by 2030 — a total of 50 million people.

“We’re close to realizing the goal of bringing clean water in Rwanda,” says World Vision U.S. President Rich Stearns. “My dream is to finish the job.”

Rich, who will retire at the end of this year, personally committed to the goal, aiming to raise $50 million to reach 1 million Rwandans in 2,000 communities with clean water.

Why set such a goal? It’s because we believe every child deserves clean water at home, at school, and at their community health clinic. “And that’s not a matter of convenience, it’s a matter of life and death,” says Rich.

The burden of dirty water falls on women and girls

Globally, 844 million people live without a safe water supply close to home. Women and girls are most affected by the difficulty in accessing clean water.

Women and girls spend an estimated 200 million hours hauling water every day, with the average African woman walking 6 kilometers to carry home 40 pounds of water. Their daily walk for water robs girls of education and moms of the chance to make a better life for their families. Read about 5-year-old Grace, in Uganda, who walks 6 kilometers for water and struggles to attend school.



Every day, more than 800 children die from diarrhea caused by contaminated water, poor sanitation, and unsafe hygiene practices. With clean water and proper sanitation and hygiene practices, these deaths are preventable. That’s why when World Vision comes to a new community, we often start by providing clean water, then address education, health, and economic empowerment to bring sustainable transformation to the people and communities we serve.

Starting in Rwanda: Universal water access

One million people in 2,000 communities where World Vision works in Rwanda lack basic access to clean water. We are committed to bringing water to every last one of them by the end of 2022.

People like Angelique Hakurinka make us believe this enormous goal can be reached.

Angelique, 33, who lives in Gashora, near Rwanda’s capital, Kigali, is not one of the millions of African women who carry water for long distances each day. Instead, she helped to bring water to her community as a member of a manual well-drilling team trained and equipped by World Vision. (Where appropriate, manually-drilled wells can save 80% of the cost of drilling with a heavy rig.)

For Angelique, who supports three children, and for her community, partnering with World Vision for clean water has been a life-changing experience.

“I thank World Vision,” Angelique says. “Besides giving us water, they gave us a chance to work for ourselves.”

In addition to community partners like Angelique, World Vision has strong government and private sector partners also committed to universal water access. As the leading nongovernmental organization providing clean water access in Rwanda, we have the capability and a proven community-based model for success.

We also have momentum. From 2012 to 2017, World Vision brought water and sanitation services to more than 340,000 people in Rwanda at a cost of $22.6 million. Globally, in the past five years, we’ve brought clean water to 14 million people. Every 10 seconds we reach one new person with clean water.

With the help of our donors and partners, we can meet our 2030 goal of bringing clean water to 50 million people.

An uphill climb to provide water for Rwanda

Rwanda, a small country of 11 million people in East-Central Africa, has made progress in development, including in providing many citizens with access to clean water. Yet, less than half of the rural population has adequate water coverage, and only 61% of the rapidly growing urban population draws water from improved sources. That means about 6 million people in Rwanda struggle to access the water they need.

Rwanda is also still emerging from the shadow of the 1994 genocide when 800,000 to 1 million people were killed in ethnic conflict over three months. World Vision began working in Rwanda that year, responding to intense humanitarian needs as well as needs for healing and peace building — for Christ’s living water as well as clean water.

In all we do in Rwanda, World Vision strives for children and families to have good health, education, child protection, spiritual nurture, and economic opportunities to live out their God-given potential. Community members contribute time and labor to build and manage their water systems. And World Vision teaches people in project areas about sanitation and hygiene practices to prevent water-related diseases.

After two decades of healing and rebuilding since the genocide, Rwanda is focused on eradicating extreme poverty. It’s likely to be the ﬁrst country in the developing world to solve its water crisis — a stunning achievement. And World Vision wants to ensure it. We have a strong track record in water programming in Rwanda, investing $22.6 million to reach 340,000 people between 2012 and 2017.

Rwanda’s government is similarly committed to providing clean water for all citizens. Its national strategy calls for universal access by 2024. The government recognizes World Vision’s role in providing clean water and has even helped fund some water systems. “Our goals are your goals,” Prime Minister Edouard Ngirente told Rich when they met in Kigali, the capital, in March.

And with clean water, lives are changed and blessings flow.

700,https://globalpressjournal.com/africa/rwanda/rwandans-struggle-tap-water-dries-capital-city/,Rwandans Struggle as Tap Water Dries Up in Capital,"KIGALI, RWANDA — It’s late afternoon, and a large group of people waits in line under the scorching sun near a natural spring located at the foot of the Kibagabaga hill in Kigali, the capital of Rwanda.

As the hours drag on, some people waiting in line with their water containers decide to fetch dirty water from a nearby swamp instead.

Being forced to wait in line for spring water is frustrating, but having to collect dirty water is even worse – especially for the residents in this neighborhood, whose homes are among the 36 percent of homes in Kigali where taps deliver clean water.

With increasing frequency, the taps in their homes are running dry.

Intermittent service has been common in the past, but lately the taps only work for three days out of seven.

Gloriose Isugi, GPJ Rwanda During water shortages, the price for a single jerry can of water triples.

Ezechias Shumbusho was in line at the spring recently. He says the growing water shortage is affecting families and businesses.

“There’s need for a sustainable solution,” he says, adding that the cost of water is going up thanks to the shortage, which is why so many people are waiting at the natural spring.

Water carriers typically sell one jerry can of water for 100 Rwandan francs (12 cents), but in times of acute water shortage, the price triples to 300 Rwandan francs (35 cents).

Rwanda, a Central African country, has recorded impressive infrastructure achievements in recent years, but access to clean and potable water remains an ongoing challenge. Most Rwandans do not have access to running water, which is supplied to some neighborhoods by the Water and Sanitation Corporation (WASAC). Walking long distances to fetch water from natural springs remains common here, and health consequences from waterborne diseases are a continuing problem.

According to WASAC, there are 172,747 homes with taps connected to the WASAC water-supply network. The majority of these are in the capital, where there are 103,318 taps. As of 2015, the population of the capital was more than 1.3 million.

Gloriose Isugi, GPJ Rwanda When lines at natural springs are too long, residents say they are forced to collect water from nearby swamps. A new water-treatment plant is being constructed in hopes of easing the problem for some.

The Kimironko administrative sector is one neighborhood where most homes have taps, with water supplied by WASAC. Dominique Murekezi, WASAC manager, acknowledges the recent shortages and says they are caused by limited water supply in the area around Kimironko.

But it’s a problem that has a solution, he says.

A new water-treatment plant called Nzove III is nearing the final stages of construction. The plant will increase water access by 40,000 cubic meters (about 10.6 million gallons) per day, Murekezi says, adding that it will be sufficient to renew supplies to Kimironko and other areas affected by ongoing shortages.

Still, water shortages will continue to impact a majority of Rwandans for the foreseeable future.

“It’s lamentable that I have to spend hours and hours here waiting for unpredictable water,” says Gilbert Urimubenshi, a Kigali resident. “I have to come here so many times, since one jerry can is not enough for my daily household water needs.”

Uganda is a country in Africa that has undergone tremendous growth in its economic sector as a result of a large amount of the population moving to urban centers in the country. However, despite this growth, the country is struggling to provide clean water to its citizens.

Although it is common for issues regarding water quality to be limited to rural areas, the country as a whole is lacking in basic necessities.

In fact, Water.org estimates that 21 percent of Ugandans lack access to safe water, and nearly 87 percent do not have sufficient sanitation facilities. A possible reason for this could be the high population growth in the country, which has stressed the water quality making it abysmal.

In Kampala City, researchers have found the presence of pathogenic bacteria in the springs, which provide a major source of water for the population. The contamination could be due to poor waste management and badly-designed pit latrines. In addition to the contaminated spring water used for domestic purposes, the drinking water quality in Uganda may be in trouble due to the presence of nitrates.

According to the National Center for Biotechnology Information, children between the ages of 12 to 14 who have come into contact with nitrate-contaminated water are reported to exhibit delayed reactions to light and sound stimuli. Clearly, the state of water in Uganda is far below adequate and is wreaking havoc on the population.

Pollution and water contamination kill millions every year and the stress put on the economic sectors by urbanization and population growth has only increased the trouble in Uganda.

In order to improve the water quality in Uganda, the country must work with organizations to provide safe water and sanitation to its citizens. For those who live in rural areas, health and hygiene education is going to be key in identifying unsafe water for domestic use and consumption.

Once the country puts these programs in place, it can focus on developing a better system to deal with its rapid economic and population growth so as to ensure everyone has access to clean water.

702,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/jeph/2019/7813962/,Safety of Drinking Water from Primary Water Sources and Implications for the General Public in Uganda,"Abstract

Background. There is scarcity of information about the quality and safety of drinking water in Africa. Without such vital information, sustainable development goal number 6 which promotes availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation remains elusive especially in developing countries. The study aimed at determining concentrations of inorganic compounds, estimated daily intake (EDI), target hazard quotient (THQ), hazard index (HI), incremental lifetime cancer risk (ILCR), and identify safe drinking water source sources in Southwestern Uganda. Methods. This was an observational study in which 40 drinking water samples were collected from georeferenced boreholes, springs, open wells, bottled, and taps within Bushenyi district of Southwestern Uganda. Water samples were analyzed for copper (Cu), iron (Fe), zinc (Zn), lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), and chromium (Cr) levels using atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS). Water safety measures (EDI, HI, and ILCR) were established for each water source and compared with local and international water permissible standards for each analyte. A spatial map was drawn using qGIS®, and analysis of quantitative data was done using MS Excel 2013 at 95% significance. Results. Heavy metals were present in the following order: 11.276 ppm > 4.4623 ppm > 0.81 ppm > 0.612 ppm > 0.161 ppm for Fe, Zn, Pb, Cu, and Cd, respectively, while Cr was not detected. Fe was the primary water heavy metal in the order of open well > borehole > tap > spring > bottled water. This was followed by Zn levels in the order of tap > bottled > spring > borehole > open well. All compounds were within international water safety standards except Pb. Hence, there is need for the government of Uganda to establish water filtration systems, particularly for Pb to improve the quality of water for the general public. The EDI was similar ( ) for water consumed from spring, bottled, and tap sources for Fe and Zn levels. Similarly, no differences were found in the EDI for children and adults ( ). Furthermore, the HI showed an absence of noncarcinogenic risk associated (HI < 1), although the ILCR was higher in adults than children ( ) due to high Cd concentrations. Conclusion. The current identified Fe is a major heavy metal in drinking water of Uganda, and boreholes were the major safest sources of drinking water identified in this study.

1. Background

Access to safe drinking water is considered a universal human right by the United Nations convention [1, 2]; however, this human right remains a dream for several developing countries in Asia, South America, and Africa. Previous studies have placed a lot of attention on the microbial load with a focus on infectious diseases [3, 4], while little information is available regarding the heavy metal concentrations in drinking water of Uganda [5, 6]. The lack of proper water treatment and increased agrochemical use and industrial growth suggest that water contamination is ongoing and is a threat to public health [6, 7]; therefore, baseline data on the safety of drinking water in Uganda could inform mitigation measures to ensure access to safe water in Uganda [8]. This would inevitably help Uganda remain on the path for the attainment of Sustainable Developmental Goal (SDG) number six which promotes access to safe drinking water [9].

In Kampala, the capital city of Uganda, previous studies identified high levels of heavy metals such as lead (Pb), zinc (Zn), iron (Fe), copper (Cu), cadmium (Cd), and chromium (Cr) were detected in drinking water [10, 11]. Similarly, those compounds have also been isolated in natural water reservoirs including lakes [12, 13], wetlands [12], fish [14, 15], and beef and milk [16]. Such contaminations pose a public health threat to Ugandans. Pb is present in petrol, paints, and water pipes and in soils within our environment [17]. It is medically used in X-ray shielding; however, information on effective waste management of Pb in Africa is limited to date, although it continues to be a global water contaminant [18–20]. In Zambia, Pb toxicity has been reported in children, and this has been associated with anemia, abdominal pains, limb pains, memory problems, headaches, weakness in hands and feet, and seizures or convulsions in humans [21, 22]; however, evidence on its carcinogenic effects in humans is limited to date [23, 24]. Cd has an established carcinogenic potential in humans, and it is often deposited in tissues in bone tissue as it substitutes for calcium to cause toxicity [25]. Cd primarily arises from soil sediments, batteries, and plastics which eventually contaminate water within the ecosystem [26]. In rats, Cd has been associated with development of respiratory tumors, and in humans, it has been linked to the prostate, kidney, and lung cancers [26–28]. Cd levels once at high levels in the environment have been shown to contaminate drinking water through increased ionic leakage into the water table [10, 29, 30] Zn is important in neurotransmission as a micronutrient since high levels can suppress Fe and Cu absorption in the gastrointestinal tract and has strong anticancer effects at high concentrations [31, 32]. Fe and Cu are micronutrients important in hemoglobin and neurofunction, respectively [16]. Cr is present in the environment in rocks, plants, and soils and is a known human carcinogen associated with stomach cancers [16, 33, 34]. Currently, Cr is used as a metal coating, pigments for paints, cement, paper, rubber, and floor coverings and commonly used as a wood preservative [35]. In water, Cr is effectively removed by coagulation-filtration on a large scale, while adsorptive filtration and ion exchange are appropriate for large-and small-scale applications [36].

Several human-based practices that include pesticide application and industrialization are associated with soil and plant contamination. Subsequently, after the heavy rains, the runoff water carries the pollutants to water reservoirs from which humans and animals consume the contaminated water [37–39]. Heavy metals subsequently bioaccumulate in the bodies of animals and humans predisposing them to cancer and other public health risks following oral ingestion [7, 40]. As a short-term solution, the installation of filters against major heavy metals would improve the safety of the consumer [29, 41]. In Uganda, major drinking water sources are borehole water, bottled water, open well water, spring water, and tap water [8, 10, 42]. Therefore, for Uganda to maintain her path to attain Goal 6 of the SDGs, there was a need to ensure that drinking water in rural communities met international standards. The scarcity of information regarding the levels of heavy metals in drinking water from major water sources in Uganda indicated a knowledge gap that necessitates the concerned bodies such as the Uganda National Water and Sewerage Cooperation (UNWSC) and the Uganda National Bureau of Standards (UNBS) to take action [9, 20]. Lest Ugandans are exposed to pollutants which expose the people in communities to various health risks including cancer [16, 43]. Therefore, the objective of this study was to measure the concentrations of Cu, Fe, Zn, Pb, Cd, and Cr, estimate the daily intake, estimate the presence of major cancer and noncancer health risks, and identify safe water sources for the people in Southwestern Uganda.

2. Methods

2.1. Study Design

This was a cross-sectional study conducted in Bushenyi district of Southwestern Uganda in July 2017. Bushenyi district lies 330.4 km from Kampala Capital city of Uganda by road. Bushenyi is bordered by Rubirizi, Buhweju, Sheema, Mitooma, and Rukungiri districts to the northwest, northeast, east, south, and west, respectively. Ishaka is its largest town which is located 75 km by road from Mbarara district which is the largest city in the region. The district coordinates are 00 32S, 30 11E. In our previous study [16], milk and beef from Bushenyi district were contaminated with heavy metals; therefore, we performed this study as a follow-up to understand the source of the contamination. The simple random sampling technique was used from which 4 subcounties in Bushenyi district were included: Ishaka-Bushenyi Municipality, Kyeizoba, Kyabugimbi, and Kigoma-Nkanga. A total of 40 drinking water samples were randomly collected. In each major trading center, 2 samples, each of 50 ml were collected into 50 ml falcon tubes using aseptic techniques from the borehole water (BHW), commercial bottled water (BotW), open well (OW), spring water (SW), and tap water (TW). The water was collected into sterile falcon tubes carefully avoiding any contamination. Georeferencing of the water samples was performed and recorded with an acceptable accuracy of 3 m using a GPS Garmin from the Uganda Government and recorded in MS Excel, and mapping was conducted using qGIS® 3.03 as shown in Figure 1. The samples were coded and taken to the laboratory for Fe, Cu, Zn, Pb, Cd, and Cr analysis as previously described [16].





2.2. Laboratory Analysis

Usually nitric acid is used for digestion of solid samples and waste water. Since this was drinking water, the use of nitric acid was to serve this particular purpose. It is the reason the statement is brought to the attention of the reader. Distilled water was used to prepare solutions and for dilution purposes. All glassware were washed and dried in the oven at 105°C. Bottles for collecting water samples were cleaned by soaking in dilute nitric acid (10%) and rinsed several times with distilled water prior to sample collection [10]. Wet digestion of the samples was subsequently done using 30 ml of nitric acid at 150°C for 45 minutes. The solution was left to evaporate up to 10 ml, and 2 ml of hydrogen peroxide was added followed by deionized water up to 30 ml. The solution was then transferred to a plastic bottle ready for analysis. The water sample solutions were analyzed with an atomic absorption spectrophotometer (AAS) (PerkinElmer 2380), which had detection limits for Pb at 0.01 ppm while for Cu, Fe, and Cr at 0.001 ppm were used as previously described [16]. Linear equations for each metal were generated in the form y = mx; where y = absorbance, m = gradient, and x = concentration for each compound using standard working standard stock solutions for the heavy metals acquired from E. Merck, D-6100, Darmstadt, FR, Germany, as previously described [16]. For Fe: y = 0.0841x, R2 = 0.8678 For Cu: y = 0.184x, R2 = 0.8748 For Zn: y = 0.299x, R2 = 0.9837 For Pb: y = 0.0296, R2 = 0.8637 For Cd: y = 0.1025x, R2 = 0.9552

These equations were used to determine the concentrations of the compounds in each sample as previously described [16].

2.3. Assessment of Water Safety against International Reference Standards

The data point generated was compared with those from Uganda National Bureau of Standards (UNBS), the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US-EPA), European Union (EU), and the World Health Organization (WHO) using the table drawn from Bamuwamye et al. [10].

2.4. Determination of the Estimated Daily Intake

This was modelled using recent Ugandan projections [10] and was calculated using the equation: where = concentration of the metal (mg/kg), = ingestion rate for water, and = body weight. In children and adults, s were 1 L/day and 2 L/day while the body weight for was 15 kg and 70 kg, respectively [10].

2.5. Determination of the Noncancer Risk Associated with Drinking Water in Uganda

The target hazard quotient (THQ) was used to generate the hazard index (HI) to determine presence of noncarcinogenic health effects following ingestion of the sampled water. The THQ was determined for Pb, Zn, Cd, Cu, and Fe (US EPA) [44] using the following equation: where = exposure dose obtained and is the oral reference dose of the contaminant. The is an estimation of the maximum permissible risk on human population through daily exposure. where is the estimated daily intake of a metal via ingestion of specific route; is the exposure frequency (365 days/year); is the exposure duration (i.e., 6 years for children and 30 years for adults); and is the period of exposure for noncarcinogenic effects (it is equal to , i.e., 2190 days in children and 10950 days in adults). Furthermore, the reference dose ( ) for each hazard was obtained from the US EPA [44], i.e., 0.004 ppm, 0.3 ppm, 0.001 ppm, 0.04 ppm, and 0.7 for Pb, Zn, Cd, Cu, and Fe, respectively. Exposure to multiple contaminants results in additive and interactive effects; thus, the hazard index (HI = ∑THQ) was used as an indication of risk.

2.6. Determination of the Incremental Lifetime Cancer Risk Associated with Drinking Water amongst Ugandans

Following chronic exposure to inorganic pollutants in drinking water, the incremental lifetime cancer risk (ILCR) was used to model the cancer risk in the Ugandan population. This was estimated using the following equation: where CDI is the chronic daily intake of a particular metal and this was estimated over the 70-year lifespan for Ugandans (i.e., = 70 yrs × x365 days = 25550 days) [16, 45]. In addition, the cancer slope factor ( ) for Cd that was used was 6.3 [23, 25].

2.7. Spatial Map on Safe Water Sources in Study Area

Information acquired from the GPS readings was exported to qGIS® version 3.03 Cirona onto an administrative file for Uganda. A sentinel-2 satellite image number L1C_T3MRV_AO07540_20180816T082305 was acquired from the United States Geographical Surveys (USGS) system to show vegetation cover in the study area.

2.8. Statistical Analysis

Data were entered and analyzed in MS Excel 2013 version after normality testing, after which parametric tests were conducted. Descriptive statistics were conducted and information was presented as mean ± SEM from which a one-way ANOVA was conducted, and significant differences were reported when . Information on safety was done using a one-sample t-test, and mean differences were used to define “high” and “low” after subtracting the sample mean from the hypothetical mean. These were used to define safety of drinking water at 95% significance. Furthermore, the EDI for children and adults for each metal was presented as mean ± SEM, and a two-sample t-test was conducted to determine differences in concentrations ingested and significance reported when . The HI was calculated to assess the presence of threat, i.e., HI > 1 as an indicative of a threat [16]. Also, significant differences in the THQs for children and adults were determined at 95% significance. Finally, ILCR was presented descriptively, and a two-sample t-test for children and adults was conducted at 95% significance. ILCR greater than 1 × 10−4 was an indicative of a cancer threat and presented with superscripts [16, 25].

3. Result

3.1. Levels of Heavy Metals from Different Water Sources in the Study Area

The study showed that Fe is the major water pollutant in the order of open well > borehole > tap > spring > bottled water. This was followed by high Zn levels in the order of tap > bottled > spring > borehole > open well. Cu and Pb concentrations were relatively comparable where Cu was found to be high in the order of tap > borehole > spring > open well > bottled. Furthermore Pb concentrations were found to be in the order of open well > borehole > tap > bottled > spring. Finally, Cd levels were found to be the lowest in all water samples; however, these were highest in the order of tap > open well, bottled water > spring > borehole. Cr was not detected in all water samples as shown in Table 1.

3.2. Safety of Drinking Water in Southwestern Uganda

Concentrations of Fe, Zn, and Cu were permissible by local and international regulatory agencies, while levels of Pb were found to be unacceptable in all water samples except borehole water using UNBS, EU, and WHO cutoff limits. The study also showed that Cd was acceptable using US-EPA and EU cutoffs as shown in Table 2. Findings in the study show that boreholes were the safest source for drinking water in Uganda.

3.3. Levels of Heavy Metals Consumed Daily in Drinking Water by Ugandans in Study Area

Ingestion of Zn and Cd from borehole drinking water was found to be significantly different amongst children and adults ( ). Also, bottled water ingestion of Pb and Cd was different amongst children and adults ( ). In open well drinking water, daily ingestion of Cu, Pb, and Cd were found to be different amongst children and adults, while significant differences in spring and tap water were only limited to Pb and Cd ( ) as shown in Table 3.

3.4. Noncancer Health Hazards Associated with Drinking Water amongst Ugandans in Study Area

The hazard index showed that all water sources were acceptable (HI < 1). The study also showed that the target hazard quotient (THQ) was significantly ( ) higher in children than in adults for Pb > Cd > Zn on borehole water. Open well water had significantly higher THQ in the order of Pb > Cd > Cu > Zn in children than in adults. In addition, bottled, spring, and tap water all had significantly higher THQs in children for Pb > Cd than in adults as shown in Table 4.

3.5. Incremental Lifetime Cancer Risk Associated with Drinking Water Consumed by Ugandans in Study Area

Ingestion of drinking water from all the water sources was associated with a very low threat of cancer in children while this was present amongst adults of the Ugandan population. In particular, significant differences were shown to exist in the incremental lifetime cancer risk (ILCR) in borehole, bottled, and open well drinking water in which adults had higher ILCR than children, i.e., Cd. In addition, the ILCR for spring and tap water was only significantly higher in adults than in children for Cd as shown in Table 5. The risk of cancer was highest in the order of tap > bottled > spring > borehole > open well water especially amongst adults than children. This was shown to be primarily associated with the high Cd levels in drinking water from these different sources.

3.6. Map Showing the Drinking Water Sources Involved in the Current Study

The study showed that safe drinking water was associated with boreholes, and a majority of these were located in Kitwe, Nyamiyaga, and Nyabubaare subcounties as well as Ward I of Ishaka-Bushenyi Municipality which are all agricultural areas as shown in Figure 4.





4. Discussion

The study showed that sampled water sources had high Fe concentrations, although Fe concentrations were highest in open water sources (Table 1). Open water sources have a high concentration of Fe in comparison to other water sources in this study possibly because the open water sources act as capture center for runoff rain water from the land which may carry Fe-rich soils [37, 38, 46]. In addition, high Zn levels in tap water (Table 1) were found to be over 100 times higher than those shown by a related study in Central Uganda [10], probably due to weaker water quality practices in rural communities of Uganda. In China, high Zn levels in drinking water have been associated with mining activities [47]; however, there was no evidence for this in Bushenyi district of Southwestern Uganda where these samples were collected showing that environmental contamination with Zn was related to the heavy pesticide usage which is common in many agricultural ecosystems [16, 48]. Furthermore, Cu concentrations were highest in tap water (Table 1) possibly due to the use of copper pipes in the transportation of water by the Uganda National Water and Sewerage Cooperation (UNWSC). Fortunately, recent developments by the UNWSC have seen an introduction of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipes especially in major towns within Uganda [10], although coverage is still low. At the time of the study, Bushenyi district was in the process of replacing the old pipes with PVC (personal observation in the community); however, information on the efficiency of these pipes in reducing heavy metal concentrations was limited in Uganda. Information in the study also showed no significant differences (ANOVA, ) in heavy metal concentrations for Fe, Cu, Zn, Pb, and Cd showing their importance to the general public due to the threat of bioaccumulation following chronic exposure [42, 49].

Concentrations for Fe, Zn, and Cu were acceptable for human ingestion with the exception of Pb (Tables 2 and 6). In Central Uganda, high Pb toxicities in drinking water had been reported [10, 11]; however, this was the first report to document the Pb contamination in drinking water from rural communities in Southwestern Uganda. Taken together, our findings suggest that heavy metals are a major concern in both the rural and urban cities of Uganda [10, 16]. The study also showed that borehole drinking water was the safest in reference to international standards showing that water quality from other water sources was in a much worse state. The installation of appropriate filters against inorganic pollutants has been associated with increased water quality, and this could be a necessity for Uganda [41]. Currently, the quality of drinking water available to Ugandans was below international standards, and this was in agreement with previous findings in the region demonstrating the importance of our findings [8, 10, 29].

The estimated daily ingestion (EDI) of heavy metals from borehole drinking water was found to be significantly different ( ) for Zn and Cd amongst children > adults (Table 3). This showed that Zn levels are high in borehole drinking water of Bushenyi district which is of physiological benefit to the community [31, 32]. Furthermore, installation of Cd filters in the boreholes would make the water much safer than it currently is due to its carcinogenic risk [10, 29, 41]. In bottled water, the EDI was also highest in children than in adults for Pb > Cd (Table 3). Our findings suggest that bottled water is not necessarily recommended for children in Uganda, and this was contrary to a previous recommendation from a study conducted in central Uganda [10]. Findings in our study might be incidental or influenced by the geographical area of the study; however, a need by the UNBS in adopting practical monitoring strategies against carcinogenic compounds in drinking water has been provided in this study. Open well drinking water also showed significant variations in Cu, Pb, and Cd levels amongst children > adults (Table 3). Open drinking water was contained with heavy metals due to heavy washoff following a heavy rain down pour [37, 38, 46]. The higher ingestion of Fe in children than in adults in drinking water from boreholes and open wells (Figure 2) was related to the poor maintenance of these facilities and mineral leaching [41].

Estimation of the noncarcinogenic health effects was done by using the hazard index, and all water samples were found to be acceptable in line with international guidelines (HI < 1); however, significant differences in borehole water were in Pb > Cd > Zn higher in children > adults (Table 4). These findings are in agreement with the recent studies in Bushenyi, which have shown children to be at a higher risk than adults to heavy metal toxicity [16]. Furthermore, bottled, spring, and tap water all had significantly higher THQs in children for Pb > Cd than in adults (Table 4). This re-emphasized previous finding in central Uganda that drinking water in Uganda was contaminated with Pb [10, 11]. Access to safe drinking water is a universal human right; thus, findings in this study cannot be taken for granted by the authorities in Uganda [1, 2, 42]. This would help reduce on the health burden associated with oral ingestion of these elements, thus promoting public health [37, 43]. The study also showed that Pb and Cd toxicities are very important in children of Southwestern Uganda (Figure 3), probably due to their smaller body weights relative to adults. This is because Pb has been associated with gastrointestinal irritation which would lead to vomiting and diarrhea while Cd has been associated with brain and kidney damage in humans [24, 50].

Chronic ingestion of heavy metals at very high concentrations in drinking water would subsequently predispose the local population to toxic health effects such as cancer. In this community, the incremental lifetime cancer risk revealed the absence of a threat in children while this was present in adults due to high Pb and Cd levels (Table 5). This was important since Pb and Cd have established carcinogenic potential in humans [16,25–28]. In Bushenyi district, agricultural usage of pesticides was the major mechanism of toxicity (data not shown). This has been propagated by the poor implementation of the drug liberalization policy which has seen associated with severe drug abuse in farming communities and subsequent heavy washoff of these chemicals into major water sources of Uganda [37, 38, 46]. This has consistently led to very high heavy metal concentrations being detected in food and drinking water products of Uganda [10, 16]. The risk of cancer was found to be highest in tap water due to high Cd levels, and this was lowest in open well water. Finally, the study identified safe drinking water centers in Nyabubaare, Ward 1 of Ishaka-Bushenyi Municipality, Kitwe, and Nyamiyaga within the study area (Figures 1 and 4). Heavy metals enter the soils and groundwater, bioaccumulate in food webs, and adversely affect the ecosystem [51], demonstrating the importance of the current findings to guide policy and promote development for increased public health amongst Ugandans in rural communities.

5. Conclusion

Drinking water in Southwestern Uganda had high Fe and Zn concentrations. The study identified borehole water as safer source of drinking water, demonstrating a need for increased monitoring by the regulatory authorities for improved water quality. The authors recommend the installation of heavy-metal filters especially against Pb and Cd to reduce on the carcinogenic risk of drinking water in the community. For increased water quality, authorities need to continuously monitor water against major heavy metals in the study since very high levels of metals once ingested can lead to severe toxicological effects in humans.

703,https://environhealthprevmed.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12199-019-0799-3,"Knowledge and practices of households on safe water chain maintenance in a slum community in Kampala City, Uganda","This study assessed knowledge and practices of households on safe water chain maintenance in households in Kasubi slum in Kampala, Uganda. Our findings show that the major sources of domestic water were private tap stands and protected springs. Most of the households paid for water, treated their water for drinking by boiling, and knew the sources of water contamination and dangers of drinking contaminated water. However, only a third of the households reported practices that maintain the safe water chain. Household heads who were females and students and/or attained post-primary education were more likely to maintain the safe water chain. Household heads who said that most contamination of water happens during storage were also more likely to maintain the safe water chain.

The major sources of domestic water in our study were private taps (71.6%) and protected springs (20.5%). The use of private tap stands is not surprising because many areas within the city including slums in Kampala are supplied with piped water from NWSC, a government agency responsible for treatment and distribution of water to the public. Similar studies done in Ghana and India have also found tap stands as a popular water source in slums [34, 35]. Slums most likely occur in low lying areas were protected springs are usually located. Protected springs and tap water are generally considered improved water sources and are therefore expected to provide relatively good quality water [36]. However, recent studies in Kampala showed that most protected springs were contaminated [10, 37]. Most households paid water bills which is expected in an urban setting since majority are connected to piped water which are metered and paid for by the final consumer.

From our study, most of the household heads knew the different ways by which water could get contaminated. Majority of respondents also knew the dangers of drinking contaminated water such as increased risk of diarrheal diseases. Since slums in Kampala have in the past experienced frequent outbreaks of diarrheal diseases especially cholera and typhoid [38], the high level of knowledge could be attributed to the intense awareness campaigns that are conducted whenever these outbreaks occur. In our study, only one third of the households maintained safe water chain management practices. This implies that two thirds of the population in slums in Kampala are at risk of drinking unsafe water and acquiring diarrheal diseases due to lack of maintenance of the safe water chain. Our findings corroborate with findings from a study in India where majority of the urban population did not observe safe water chain practices [39]. Therefore, there is a need to increase slum communities’ awareness on maintenance of the safe water chain.

Most households used collection and storage containers that would minimize contamination which is a good practice. However, few households were cleaning their containers regularly. In addition, most of the containers were not covered, and only a few households used a separate cup to draw drinking water from the containers (16.7%). This practice is sometimes discouraged with preference for small-mouthed containers. Educating people about the risk and pathways of water contamination can help improve water quality and consequently mitigate risks of diarrheal diseases. Another finding from our study is that boiling was the most common method of treatment of drinking water. This finding is similar to that from another Ugandan study that established that majority (89%) of the households were boiling their drinking water [40]. Boiling is known to be the most popular water treatment method especially in low-income countries [41]. It is a reliable treatment method against microbial agents if well used, and water thereafter well stored [41, 42]. Practicing such simple and cheap interventions at household level can lead to an improvement in the quality of drinking water which eventually leads to reduction in diarrheal diseases [43].

Female-headed households were more likely maintain safe water chain management practices. Our finding is in line with a study conducted in Cameroon which indicated that female-headed households were more likely to invest in the effort of fetching clean water and ensuring proper storage [43]. It has also been shown that women often engage in water collection, storage and treatment, and use compared to men in communities especially in slums [44, 45]. Women are at higher risk of water-borne and water-based infections such as diarrhea, ascariasis, and trichuriasis than men, as such observing high standards of safe water chain to minimize water-borne disease risk is imperative to them [46, 47]. Student-led households were more likely to observe the safe water chain as compared to those who were engaged with business. This finding was understandable as students are likely to be routinely taught WASH aspects at school. Indeed, some studies have demonstrated that students can learn many things at school and influence behavior change in their homes and communities [48, 49]. This shows that education can influence household practices on safe water chain. Household heads who had attained post-primary education were more likely to observe safe water chain compared to those with primary or no education. This finding is in line with studies [50,51,52] which indicated that high levels of education result in adoption of better decisions on safe water management. Educational awareness programs on safe water chain are needed to benefit individuals with low education status and consequently minimize risk due to poor safe water practices.

Contamination of water can occur at any point in the water chain from the source to the point of use [53, 54]. In our study, household heads who thought most contamination occurs during storage were more likely to observe safe water chain compared to those who thought it occurs more at the source. It is known that significant recontamination of water can occur through drawing it with cups and hands as reported in other studies [55, 56]. Evidence also shows that point-of-source bacterial contamination may be rare when water is obtained from standpipes or taps as in the case of this setting. In fact, many city water supplies are treated centrally in conventional systems but contamination could occur mostly through unsafe water storage [57, 58]. However, there is a need to educate slum dwellers on critical safe water chain practices that need to be maintained along the entire drinking water chain as demonstrated in an Ethiopian study on the effect of WASH on childhood illnesses [59].

Our study is limited by the fact that all practices reported about were self-reported and could have been subject to social desirability bias. However, the study makes a significant contribution regarding safe water chain maintenance in an urban slum which has rarely been researched. The study findings could also be generalizable to other slums in Kampala city as these have been reported to be similar in context.","This study assessed knowledge and practices of households on safe water chain maintenance in households in Kasubi slum in Kampala, Uganda.

Poor water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) continue to contribute to the high prevalence of diarrhoeal diseases in low-income countries such as Uganda particularly in slums. We implemented a 3-year WASH project in two urban slums in Uganda with a focus on safe drinking water and improvement in sanitation. The project implemented community and school interventions in addition to capacity building initiatives. Community interventions included home improvement campaigns, clean-up exercises, water quality assessment, promotion of drinking safe water through household point-of-use chlorination, promotion of hand washing, and support towards solid waste management. In schools, the project supported health clubs and provided them with “talking compound” messages. The capacity building initiatives undertaken included training of youth and community health workers. Project evaluation revealed several improvements in WASH status of the slums including increase in piped water usage from 38% to 86%, reduction in use of unprotected water sources from 30% to 2%, reduction in indiscriminate disposal of solid waste from 18% to 2%, and increase in satisfaction with solid waste management services from 40% to 92%. Such proactive and sustainable community interventions have the potential to not only improve lives of slum inhabitants in developing countries but also create lasting impact.

1. Introduction

In many African countries including Uganda, there has been rapid growth of slum populations that are majorly situated in urban settings such as town and cities [1]. Slum dwellings are characterized by several problems that only vary in magnitude from one place to another including poor solid waste management; improper excreta and wastewater management; unequipped drainage especially of storm water; poor housing conditions; insufficient drinking water; unsafe food; poor vector and vermin control; and inadequate personal and general hygiene [2, 3]. The situation is aggravated by the fact that urban authorities lack the resources to satisfactorily provide required services and infrastructure [1]. As a result, slums have become breeding grounds for disease [2], making the search for solutions to improve health in such communities an utmost urgency.

In slum settlements of Kampala and Mukono located in central Uganda, the majority of community members have insufficient knowledge of the link between water, sanitation, hygiene, and health, evidenced by the epidemics of cholera and typhoid, and a high incidence of diarrheal diseases particularly in children under 5 years of age [4, 5]. Slum settlements in Kampala are among the areas that have experienced majority of the cholera outbreaks in Uganda [4], and the district registered a major outbreak of typhoid in 2015 [5]. Other health conditions common in slums which affect mostly children include malnutrition, malaria, and pneumonia. Available evidence shows that poor water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) plays an important role in the transmission of diarrheal diseases [6–8]. Moreover, cholera is almost always transmitted by consumption of contaminated drinking water and food [9]. The major factors leading to this contamination are low latrine and water coverage and poor domestic and personal hygiene practices [10]. As a result of poor planning, the location of pit latrines and other sanitary facilities is such that they end up contaminating drinking water sources [5]. Most latrine facilities used in slums are unimproved, privately owned, and are shared among several households [11]. Insecure tenure in these communities also contributes to low latrine coverage while the communal sharing of latrine facilities leads to their poor utilization and maintenance [11]. Evidence from systematic reviews and meta-analyses of WASH interventions in poor communities with unsafe water and inadequate sanitation has shown that interventions can reduce the risk of diarrheal diseases [6, 7] and water related diseases including ascariasis, dracunculiasis, hookworm infection, schistosomiasis, and trachoma [12, 13].

The envisaged plausible interventions to which this project was targeted were to seek solutions within the affected communities in order to improve the prevailing poor environment in slums as a deliberate effort to improve community health. This therefore necessitated the implementation of the project in two urban slum areas in Uganda with the aim of improving the health status of the inhabitants through conducting community proactive and sustainable interventions targeting two priority problem areas of access to safe drinking water and improved sanitation facilities. This paper describes the interventions that were undertaken by the project to improve the WASH status in two urban slums in Kampala and Mukono in central Uganda. The three-year project, which was carried out between 2010 and 2013, had three phases: preparatory, implementation, and evaluation as described below.

2. Preparatory Phase

2.1. Implementing Partners

The project was implemented through a partnership between Makerere University School of Public Health (MakSPH), Uganda; University at Albany, State University of New York, USA; and Tuskegee University, USA. Whereas MakSPH was responsible for the day to day running of activities, the US partners were involved in planning and management of the project. In addition, the US partners conducted visits to Uganda to support the Uganda team in implementation as well as for monitoring and evaluation purposes.

2.2. Project Sites

The project was implemented in two urban slum communities in central Uganda. These were Kikulu zone in Kawempe division, Kampala district, the country’s capital city, and Kikooza zone in Mukono Municipality, approximately 20 kilometers from Kampala. Kampala and Mukono districts are among the most populated districts in Uganda and were in 2014 estimated to have populations of 1,516,210 and 599,817 persons, respectively [14]. Kikulu zone has an estimated area of 6 square kilometers with a population of 6,576, with three primary schools and one secondary school [15]. There are no government health units in the area with the nearest health unit located approximately 1.5 kilometers from the zone. The area is predominantly residential with several small businesses managed by residents. Kikooza zone is also predominantly residential with a few dwellers operating small scale trading businesses although agriculture is also conducted by some residents. The zone is located within one kilometer from Mukono town and is along the highway between Kampala and Jinja, a major town in the country. There are no government schools or health facilities in Kikooza; therefore residents have to travel for close to one kilometer to access the nearest facilities. However, private clinics and schools do exist in the area although services offered by such facilities are more costly compared to public ones.

2.3. Project Initiation

The project team held several meetings with local leaders, responsible health departments, and the general community to introduce the project to them. The project then established a field office in each study site to support implementation of activities. A community member was recruited from each area as a caretaker of the office and for community mobilization during project activities. The project initiation was important in ensuring that various stakeholders appreciated the project. In addition, the initiation prepared them to actively take part in the numerous project interventions.

2.4. Ethical Considerations

The project got ethical approval from Makerere University School of Public Health Higher Degrees, Research and Ethics Committee (101), as well as research clearance from the Uganda National Council for Science and Technology (HS 867). Several meetings were held with the community local leaders informing them about the project activities and all respondents who participated in surveys did so only after clearly understanding its purpose and giving written informed consent.

2.5. Baseline Survey

A baseline survey to assess the WASH status of the communities was conducted that involved both quantitative and qualitative methods. This survey involved 102 and 111 households in Kampala and Mukono, respectively. The baseline survey involved a household survey using a questionnaire administered among household heads or the next responsible adult found at home at the time of data collection, and an observational checklist used to observe parameters of interest at the household. The study questionnaire had questions on household water and sanitation, drinking water sources, bathroom and latrine, and rubbish disposal. In addition, the questionnaire assessed the household health seeking behavior and child morbidity for fever and diarrhea in the two weeks preceding the survey. The questionnaire also recorded social demographic characteristics of the household heads. On the other hand, the observational checklist was used to assess different WASH aspects including environmental sanitation, status of sanitary facilities, and state of water storage facilities. Household questionnaires were administered to respondents at selected households and, for each household, an observational checklist was filled. To select households, each zone was divided into five geographical clusters from which around 20 households were randomly sampled. In each cluster, the relative central point was the starting point from which data collectors then moved spirally outwards skipping one household. Only households with children below five years of age were eligible to participate in the survey. In the event that a household did not have a child under five years of age, the next household which met that criteria was selected. Additionally, 8 focus group discussions were conducted for community categories of adult male, adult female, male youth, and female youth, and 24 key informant interviews carried out with local leaders, teachers, health workers, and religious leaders. The survey also involved bacteriological analysis of drinking water from all households involved.

The baseline survey found that the major sources of water used by the community were piped water (38%) plus protected (30%) and unprotected springs (20%). In addition, the survey showed that although majority of households (86%) had latrines, the sanitary status found at most of them was poor. This included lack of hole covers (84%) and hand washing facilities (70%). The main method of solid waste disposal was dumping in open pits then burning (55%) while others buried it (11%), disposed of it indiscriminately (18%), or used skips (7%). Only 40% of the households were satisfied with the solid waste management services in their community. In addition, 48% of households lacked dustbins while more than half (55%) did not have external drying racks for their utensils. Among households, 40% disposed their waste water in drainage channels and 33% in their backyard while only 2% used soak pits. Furthermore, although the majority of households (95%) claimed to treat their drinking water, boiling (94%) being the most commonly used method, only 39% samples had water with no Escherichia coli. Most households (54%) also kept their drinking water on floor level.

Results from the baseline survey (including the qualitative component) also revealed gaps in WASH including poor water quality of the sources used by the community; poor sanitation status including the sharing of latrines by some households and their poor maintenance; poor solid waste management; and poor knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding WASH among community members. This therefore provided the basis for implementation of the project in these areas. The information obtained from the baseline survey was crucial for designing the WASH interventions for the slum communities as part of the project and were used as reference for later evaluation. The baseline survey findings were shared with the respective communities, their leaders, and other stakeholders through meetings, routine visits, reports, and training sessions.

3. Implementation Phase

3.1. Project Interventions

The project carried out several WASH interventions within the project sites working hand in hand with various stakeholders like the community, health practitioners, local leaders, community health workers (CHWs), and teachers among others. The project activities were categorized into community interventions, school interventions, and capacity building initiatives as elaborated below.

3.2. Community Interventions

3.2.1. Home Improvement Campaign

The project worked with community mobilizers and CHWs to implement home improvement campaigns in the area. This involved carrying out house to house visits to ascertain the WASH status of households. Based on findings of the inspections, the team would sensitize household members on the ideal requirements in a home. This activity was useful to households as they were told the WASH shortfalls in their homesteads and advised of the appropriate measures to improve the situation. The major concerns established at households during the inspections were maintenance of latrines, personal hygiene, solid waste management, and water quality and drainage.

3.2.2. Clean-Up Exercises

The project team supported the communities in routine clean-up exercises in their area to improve sanitation through sensitization, mobilization of community members, and provision of necessary equipment such as rakes, brooms, slashers, and personal protective wear notably gloves and gumboots. The clean-up exercises involved collection of wastes from the community, sweeping the area, digging and desilting drainage channels, and slashing overgrown vegetation among others. These activities were carried out by the community members themselves with the project team only providing support including necessary logistics. This improved the aesthetic appearance of the areas and reduced waste in the community. Such waste would otherwise be a source of vector breeding in the community such as flies and rats.

3.2.3. Improvement of Water Sources and Water Quality Assessment

The project team carried out routine sanitary inspection of water sources to identify hazards in the water supply system that had the potential to contaminate them. They then, together with the community members, worked hand in hand to eliminate such hazards and reduce chances of water contamination. This activity included regular improvement of the drainage of the sources as well as educating the users on the proper use of facilities. The project also carried out regular water sampling and analysis from randomly selected communal and household sources and supported interventions to improve water quality. The findings from water quality analysis were regularly shared with community members. Individuals responsible for sources that were found to be contaminated were advised on respective interventions including treating drinking water, for example, by boiling. This ensured that the community accessed and utilized water from safer sources.

3.2.4. Promotion of Household Chlorination

The project partnered with Uganda Health Marketing Group (UHMG), a nongovernmental organization, to promote use of chlorine tablets (Aquasafe™) as an option of treating drinking water at households. This involved conducting training sessions on the use of Aquasafe and subsequently promoting its use in the community. This method, which was unknown by many community members, was greatly appreciated particularly by households that had difficulty in boiling water for drinking. Indeed, the use of Aquasafe greatly increased in the communities during the project which further promoted drinking safe water.

3.2.5. Promotion of Hand Washing

The project promoted hand washing with soap at critical times particularly before eating food and after visiting the latrine. Special training sessions on hand washing, specifically, the use of tippy tap technology were conducted in the community (Figure 1). The tippy tap is a simple device for hand washing with running water made of locally available materials. It consists of a container that holds water, which is tipped by a foot-operated stick and rope tied through a small hole in the container cap for water to flow during hand washing. Following the training sessions, over 200 households in the study areas constructed these hand washing facilities at their latrines with support of the project. The introduction of the tippy tap technology greatly improved the hand washing practices of the general community including children who enjoyed using the facility after latrine use.





3.2.6. Support to Waste Management

At the start of the project, the baseline survey had established challenges in solid waste management in the slums. The project therefore promoted resource reuse and recovery from household waste. These included waste separation at point of generation, composting for biodegradable wastes, and reuse for plastics. During dissemination of baseline findings and subsequent training, the community was educated on the preferred options of waste management, including recycling. The project then supported a youth organization (Youth Centre Support Network) to reduce waste in the areas by collection of plastics. This support included the provision of protective equipment like gloves and gumboots as well as training of youth involved regarding ideal ways of waste management. In addition, the community was sensitized about the dangers of poorly disposed plastics. The collection of plastics greatly improved the management of solid wastes as fewer plastics were available in the general waste stream after the intervention. The plastics were later sold to a recycling plant in Kampala, from which they earned some income.

3.2.7. Stool Examination among Children

In the first year of the project, continuous stool sample collection and examination from children under 5 years with diarrhea was conducted. Based on the results, children were referred to nearest health facilities for treatment. However, this activity was not sustainable as the community’s expectations of providing medicine to the sick children could not be met by the project. Nevertheless, families whose children were examined were appreciative of this initiative by the project. In addition, the project increased awareness on the need to have children with diarrhea examined by health workers as soon as they were ill.

3.2.8. Advisory Roles in WASH

The project provided advisory roles in WASH to the project communities. This included routine visits to the communities where meetings were held to discuss WASH challenges that were being faced. These meetings were attended by the project team, local leaders, CHWs, and other health authorities in the area. This helped support the community and provided information necessary to promote WASH in the area. The expertise of the project team in WASH was particularly important in supporting improvement in the area.

3.3. School Interventions

3.3.1. Support to Health Clubs

The project supported health clubs in two primary schools in the project communities. These schools were Kikulu primary school (Kampala) and Lweza primary school (Mukono). The project conducted several WASH activities among the health club members of these schools including training, health education, demonstrations, and drawing competitions. The training of these pupils not only benefitted them but also colleagues in addition to their family members. The health club members were WASH ambassadors in the schools who played a crucial role of promoting proper sanitation and hygiene practices among pupils. The patrons of health clubs, who were school teachers, were also involved in the activities. At the end of the project, 200 health club pupils were rewarded for their participation in the activities with school bags having health messages. The messages on the bags such as “keep your environment clean” also promoted WASH in the schools.

3.4. “Talking Compound” Messages in Schools

To promote appropriate WASH practices in the two schools, the project supported the development of “talking compound” messages which were displayed in appropriate places in the compound (Figure 2). The messages were as follows: “Wash hands after visiting the toilet”; “Sleep under a mosquito net”; “Wash your hands before eating food”; “Remove stagnant water from your compound”; and “Keep the environment clean.” These messages helped promote sanitation and hygiene among the entire school population and were very popular among the pupils and teachers. These messages also acted as reminders for the pupils to always observe proper sanitation and hygiene practices.





3.5. Capacity Building Initiatives

3.5.1. Capacity Building of Youth in WASH

Several youths in the project areas were trained in WASH techniques including inspection of households and water sources, use of water testing equipment, and research (Figure 3). They then worked hand in hand with project staff to implement interventions and in mobilizing the community for various activities. This helped build the capacity of the youth in the project sites as a sustainability strategy. Following the training and mentorship offered to the youth, they were able to carry out WASH improvement activities in the community on their own including household inspections.





3.5.2. Training Community Members in WASH

The project trained 41 community members in a two-day short course in WASH. Those trained were community health workers, local leaders, and individuals involved in community work in their area. The trainees were responsible for promoting WASH in their respective communities through health education, house to house visits, clean-up exercises, and improving solid waste management among other responsibilities. These activities were to be carried out not only during but also after the project. The training sessions were facilitated by faculty of Makerere University School of Public Health and conducted in the community. The trainees received certificates on completion of the training (Figure 4) and t-shirts. The t-shirts were particularly important for identity during their health promotion work in the community.





3.5.3. Exchange Visits

The project organized visits between members of the two study sites (project mobilizers and community health workers) to learn from each other and share experiences. These were crucial for each group to appreciate the challenges faced by the other slum areas as well as understand how the other groups promoted WASH in their communities. These exchange visits also provided an opportunity for learning how the other community had implemented project interventions. This fostered mutual learning between the project mobilizers and CHWs and further built their capacity in WASH. It was evident that although both communities were slums, there was a lot to learn from each other including approaches used to address WASH challenges. For example, one of the sites was turning solid waste into briquettes for use as cooking fuel which was taught to their counterparts.

3.5.4. Capacity Building of Makerere University Faculty

Several staff members of the Department of Disease Control and Environmental Health at Makerere University School of Public Health were involved in various project activities as a form of capacity building. These staff included lecturers, research fellows, and laboratory and administrative assistants. The activities staff were involved in included health education, community and school training, research, and provision of advisory roles in WASH to the community. This also gave the faculty an opportunity of closely working with a community as well as appreciating the challenges faced by urban slums in the country. The experiences gained by the faculty were also useful during their teaching of students at the university as well as research. One faculty member was also sponsored as part of the project to study an M.S. in Environmental Health at the University of Albany, USA.

3.5.5. Strengthening Laboratory Capacity at Makerere University

The project procured two microscopes and three pieces of bacteriological water testing equipment for Makerere University to support laboratory work during the implementation of project activities including water quality testing and stool examination. This equipment strengthened laboratory capacity and continued to be used by students of Environmental Health Sciences at Makerere University to conduct practical sessions. Faculty also used the equipment during their research activities even beyond the project.

3.5.6. Research and Learning

The project supported research activities carried out in the communities including a research that assessed the community knowledge, attitudes, and practices on solid waste management. This study provided information that was useful in advising the community on how to improve on waste management in their area. In addition to community dissemination, results of the study were also shared with the wider scientific audience through a peer-reviewed publication [3]. The project also supported 2 postgraduate students from United Kingdom (UK) who carried out their academic research within the study area. One student from Nottingham Trent University, UK, studied the role of CHWs in community development while the other from Trinity College, Dublin, Ireland, assessed the hand washing practices of the community. In addition, the project supported Environmental Health students at Makerere University to gain field exposure by their involvement in project activities (Figure 5). The activities they were mainly involved in included household visits, sanitary inspection of water sources, and promotion of hand washing using tippy taps. This field exposure was very important to the students to add to the theoretical knowledge that they had been taught in class. The project areas were also used as field sites for other students who were interested in learning about project activities including those studying a certificate course in WASH at Makerere University School of Public Health.





3.5.7. Project Sustainability

Several proactive sustainable interventions were implemented during the project. These included the capacity building of youths and CHWs through training and exposure in WASH. The project also utilized already existing CHWs which was a means of further building their capacity and ensuring continuity in their work as these are charged with health promotion at the community level and are the first point of contact with the health system in such areas. The project also ensured that implementation of interventions was led by the community itself which led to ownership of the project and contributed to its continuity. Additionally, the project worked together with local stakeholders such as local and religious leaders, nongovernmental organizations, and the community in all project phases which further promoted ownership and support for project interventions. All these interventions were geared towards ensuring that project interventions were sustained beyond the project lifespan.

4. Evaluation Phase

4.1. Project Evaluation

After the project implementation period, a final evaluation survey was carried out among 300 households (150 from each site) in the community. The survey was cross-sectional in design and involved both quantitative and qualitative data collection methods. The same questionnaire and observational checklist that had been used during the baseline survey was utilized for the end term evaluation. From these households, the household heads or their spouses answered the questionnaire and observations were made of the sanitary and environmental hygiene of the household. To determine households to participate in the survey, each study site was divided into four (4) geographical clusters from which an average of 38 households was sampled from each. In each cluster, the relative central point was the starting point and moved spirally outwards skipping one household. All households in the area were eligible to participate in the survey. Also, drinking water samples were collected from households involved in the survey. In addition, 24 key informant interviews were also carried out with local leaders, school teachers, and health workers, and 8 focus group discussions were conducted with community members separate for adult women, adult men, female youths, and male youths.

The evaluation revealed several improvements in the WASH status of the slum communities. Indeed, piped water usage improved from 38% to 86% with a reduction in the use of unprotected sources from 30% to 2%. Treatment of drinking water improved from 95% to 99% with more households (96%) boiling their water than 94% who did so at the baseline. Additionally, latrine coverage improved from 86% to 99% and the status of the latrines also improved. Indiscriminate disposal of solid waste reduced from 18% to 2% and satisfaction with solid waste management services increased from 40% to 92%. The number of households with no dustbin reduced from 48% to 30%, though those without utensil drying rack increased from 55% to 70%. In addition, presence of soak pits for management of waste water at households increased from 2% to 10% and fewer households disposed waste water in their backyard, from 33% to 27%.

The evaluation survey including the qualitative component revealed that there were significant improvements in the WASH status of these communities after the implementation of several multifaceted interventions. These improvements were in WASH practices, for example, hand washing, boiling of drinking water, management of solid waste, cleanliness of drainage channels, water sources management, environmental hygiene, general cleanliness of the area, and cleanliness of sanitary facilities. There was also a reported reduction in diarrheal diseases among the study communities qualitatively. Findings from the project evaluation were widely shared with community members through meetings, routine visits, and reports. Findings were also shared with the wider audience through conferences, exhibitions, and seminars.

5. Challenges Faced in Implementation of Project Activities

5.1. Migration in and out of the Community

One of the major challenges the project faced was the frequent migration of people in and out of the areas. Being residents of slums, some of the population were not permanent residents and hence moved to other areas whenever there was a need, for example, in search for jobs. This negatively affected the project as some of the members trained left the community. This challenge was mainly addressed by selecting members for the major project training who had lived in the area for a long time and were not expected to leave the community.

5.2. Undesirable Community Behavior

In certain circumstances, the behaviors of some members of the community were undesirable regarding implementation of project activities. For example, even with extensive mobilization, some members of the community would not turn up for health education sessions. This was because, being residents of slums, some of the population felt less concerned with community activities as it was not their area of birth/home village. This problem was also more pronounced in Kikulu slum located within the capital city compared to the Kikooza slum in Mukono district. However, the many people who attended these sessions were expected to pass on the messages to other members of the community. A few community members also stole the tippy taps from some latrines in the area. This was either to use them at their own latrines or use the jerrycans for other purposes. This forced some community members to lock the jerrycan inside the latrine as opposed to having it installed outside the facility. Although the community was extensively sensitized on the importance of these hand washing facilities, some members still continued with this negative practice.

5.3. Unfavorable Weather

During some times of the year, bad weather notably heavy rains could not enable carrying out certain project activities such as house to house visits and other field activities. As soon as the weather improved, the project team together with the other stakeholders including the community was able to implement the pending activities planned for the respective periods.

5.4. Poor WASH Infrastructure

The project areas had poor WASH infrastructure including few and unprotected water sources, dilapidating housing, poor state of latrines, lack of provisions for solid waste management, for example, skips, and insufficient health facilities. These infrastructural challenges negatively affected implementation of certain project interventions; for example, some wells were dilapidated that mere community cleaning and drainage improvement would not improve quality of the water. In addition, even after community sensitization to improve solid waste management practices, there were not enough skips for waste collection from the community yet the scope of the project did not include provision of such WASH infrastructure/facilities.

6. Discussion

This project demonstrated how the partnership between US universities and one in Uganda helped improve the lives of residents in urban slums through implementation of proactive and sustainable WASH interventions with full community involvement. Indeed, the project mainly provided support to community members who then actively participated in many activities such as clean-up campaigns, improvement of water sources, and installation of handwashing facilities at their households. Community participation in WASH projects increases ownership of the interventions and generates a positive attitude towards practices [16]. In addition, community projects with elements of social action tend to amplify impact by providing benefits at both community and individual household levels and support local governance to oversee interventions [17–19], which are important in ensuring the sustainability of project interventions. The project also trained CHWs, local leaders, and youth in the communities so as to take lead in implementing project activities which was crucial in the success observed and can be replicated in other programs. In addition, training of CHWs ensured that individuals already involved in health promotion were better equipped to improve the health and wellbeing of their respective communities, which together with capacity building of youth and local leaders was crucial in ensuring that WASH interventions would continue to be implemented after the project duration. This stresses the importance of building sustainability components in WASH interventions early enough and throughout project implementation so that there is continuity even after projects end. In fact, sustainability of interventions is considered the ultimate test that all development projects should strive to achieve [20, 21].

The health clubs in the two primary schools greatly benefitted from project activities in the schools. The “talking compound” messages at the schools were also key in reminding the pupils and promoting ideal practices for the improvement of their hygiene and health. It was therefore a beneficial strategy to not only work with the general community but also promote sanitation and hygiene in schools. The pupils were always enthusiastic and eager to learn probably since they were members of health clubs with interest in health issues. It was noted that the sessions conducted in the schools as part of the project not only benefitted the trained individuals but other pupils in the school as well as family members. Indeed, previous research has demonstrated that school WASH interventions targeting children can also have an impact on their parents and the wider community [22–24]. Future projects implementing WASH interventions could utilize schools as an avenue for having a significant impact in the community.

The project had a significant impact at institutional level besides the community. At Makerere University, the laboratory capacity was greatly strengthened by the acquisition of water testing equipment and microscopes which were nonexistent before the project. This greatly supported the Bachelors program in Environmental Health Science as well research by staff at Makerere University School of Public Health. Students involved in the project were also eager to learn about project activities in the field as well as take part in planned activities which benefitted them through obtaining field exposure at the sites and carrying out internship in the community. The communities benefitted from the various project activities which improved their knowledge, attitudes, and practices in WASH. This certainly improved their lives and hence contributed to reduction in the occurrence of diarrhea and related diseases as has been demonstrated in previous studies [6, 25, 26].

7. Limitations

Although the project focused on capacity building (training, sensitization, and health education), the communities also had challenges in WASH infrastructure including few and unprotected water sources, dilapidating housing, poor state of human excreta disposal facilities, and insufficient health facilities. These communities would therefore benefit from future interventions targeting improvement of such infrastructure. Even if this was beyond the scope of the project, it was appreciated as a need that could be addressed to further improve the lives of the inhabitants of these (and other) slums in Uganda. In addition, the project was implemented in only two urban slums. However, it is worth noting that Kampala alone as a district has over 10 slum communities. This shows that there is a lot of potential to replicate project interventions in other slums. This project was clearly a pilot with its success being critical for use in improving WASH in other slum areas in Uganda and sub-Saharan Africa.

8. Conclusion

The project improved the WASH status of communities in two urban slums in Uganda through implementation of proactive and sustainable interventions both in the community and schools. Urban slums can benefit from WASH interventions when communities are fully involved in all stages of implementation with a focus on capacity building. The achievements of the project can inform the design and implementation of future interventions to improve WASH in urban slums in developing countries.

The project activities were categorized into community interventions, school interventions, and capacity building initiatives as elaborated below.
All these interventions were geared towards ensuring that project interventions were sustained beyond the project lifespan.
In addition, presence of soak pits for management of waste water at households increased from 2% to 10% and fewer households disposed waste water in their backyard, from 33% to 27%.

Our fieldwork took us to clinics across the western region of the country. As someone passionate about human rights advocacy, I was particularly interested in Rwamwanja Health Center III, a facility located in the Rwamwanja Refugee Settlement in the Kamwenge district.

Among countries in Africa, Uganda has the largest number of refugees -- about 1.3 million people -- due to its welcoming policies and proximity to nearby conflicts in South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo. The majority of nearly 70,000 refugees living at the Rwamwanja settlement, I learned, have fled from the Congo.

I witnessed firsthand how Rwamwanja Health Center's human and material resources were stretched to their limits. A large crowd of mothers -- many carrying infants on their backs in colorful slings known as ekyaahi -- waited patiently in front of a gray cement pavilion. They had arrived early in the morning seeking free immunizations for their children, their dedication a reflection of the dangers of communicable diseases in this context. The outpatient department overflowed with patients, many waiting long hours beneath a UNICEF tent shading them from the intense August sun.

Each health worker in the outpatient clinic, we were told, saw around 75 patients per day, and the maternity ward provided care for hundreds of delivering mothers every month. That large patient population makes it difficult to maintain a steady flow of clean water. Although the facility now has water piped through the national system, thanks to political activism and an influx of international donor support, the area's high population density coupled with the center's large number of patients place excessive demands on the system. Reservoir tanks are filled by pumping groundwater, and harvest tanks collect rainwater when it's available. A chlorine generator is used to dose water every morning for the health center, which has reduced the need for common substitutes such as detergent and soap. However, the tanks' piping systems and chlorination processes require regular maintenance to ensure a sustainable, uninterrupted water supply.

Maintaining safe handwashing practices also presented a challenge. Handwashing stations were scattered around the large facility, typically near each department; and at the main entrance, the askari (security guards) reminded patients entering and leaving the facility to wash their hands with chlorinated water. Every morning, staff members in the public health department hold education sessions to teach patients about the importance of hand hygiene for infection prevention. Village health teams take the message to rural communities. These practices were instituted in the wake of Ebola virus threats. Earlier in the year, suspected cases of Ebola were reported in nearby districts, and staff members worked with outside groups to prevent cases from cropping up at Rwamwanja. Remnants of the awareness campaigns, including seven-foot banners illustrating the warning signs of Ebola, were visible throughout the compound. However, while we were there the handwashing stations ran out of chlorinated water several times, emphasizing the gaps in preparedness if such an outbreak surfaced in this setting.

In our interviews, health workers and community support staff in Rwamwanja and other facilities told us that these types of efforts for Ebola prevention improved water, sanitation and hygiene, but that they worried the improvements may not be sustainable. Fear of epidemic disease, they told us, only motivates handwashing in the short term. In the long run, continued support and monitoring are needed for both health workers and patients to practice safe hygiene. Additionally, while handwashing in chlorinated water is appropriate in outbreak settings, standards from the World Health Organization recommend using a stronger cleanser on a routine basis.

These findings reinforced my commitment to our study. I hope our work will help Rwamwanja Health Center III and other similar rural health facilities move closer to sustainable interventions in the future and become better equipped to avert infectious disease outbreaks.

Then came the alarms raised by those living in the hilltop areas, those who could run, racing down to warn people along the valley and lowlands to run. A torrent of water was on its way down the mountain. Four rivers in Kasese district – the Nyamwamba, Mubuku, Nyamughasana and Lhubiriha – had burst their banks.

“I realised a disaster was coming. It was a matter of life and death,” Masika, 34, tells the Guardian. “I ran back to the house to wake up my husband and children. I knocked and alerted our neighbours. The floods and stones are coming to kill us,” she says.

That night heavy rains in the area of western Uganda swept away homes, schools, submerged farms, cut off bridges and left several roads inaccessible, affecting 24,760 houses and an estimated 173,000 people, according to a disaster committee interim assessment report.

“We couldn’t sleep on the hill. It was so cold. The children were crying. There was nothing I could do,” says Masika as she lights a fire to cook at a makeshift home in Kilembe, about 10km north-west of Kasese town.

“We came back in the afternoon after the water had receded and saw the great devastation of the floods. The water destroyed and swept away everything,” she says. “We have been left homeless and very desperate. Where do we start from? We need urgent assistance.”

A few kilometres down the road of this tourist region, Philly Donald Baluku, a travel guide, said the impact was a disaster. “I have been working as a tour guide on a contract basis. The tourism sector closed because of Covid-19 restrictions. The floods have rendered me homeless now,” says Baluku.

“What do I do? I have nine dependents. My brother has offered us a single room to stay. But we don’t have bedding and food. We are living in a very hopeless and desperate situation.

“All my property, banana plantations, vanilla and crops which I was supposed to harvest in September were swept away.”

The floodwater destroyed the Nyamwamba hydroelectric power station, and overran the wards, mortuary and drug stores of Kilembe Mines hospital.

The villages of Kyanjuki, Bulembia and Katiri are now buried under mud and huge stones that were propelled down the mountain. Homes on lower land are submerged in water.

“I haven’t seen anything like this. I’m seeing for the first time where everything has been run down,” says Stephen Oluka, the director of Uganda’s National Emergency Coordination and Operations Centre, on a visit to Kasese town.

“The infrastructure has been damaged. The hospital and power station has been overrun. People’s houses along the path have all been swept away. Gardens, crops and cows have been taken away,” he says.

Buildings damaged by the flooding at Kilembe

Schools and churches have been designated temporary displacement camps.

“The living conditions are bad and alarming. The basic facilities are lacking,” says Catherine Kugoza, 37, a mother of six, sheltering in Karusandara church, about 20km south of Kasese.

“We are starving. People are taking dirty water from the stream. The one latrine is full. People are defecating in the open. This is a recipe for disease outbreaks like cholera and dysentery.”

When the Guardian visited Karusandara on Saturday, the camp was hosting more than 1,000 people, mostly women and children, with just 18 tents supplied by Save the Children.

“It’s a crisis situation. We have children in the camps. They don’t have blankets, they need mosquito nets, people don’t have food,” says Robert Centenary, a lawmaker for Kasese municipality. “People don’t have supplies for purifying water; they don’t have utensils to use in the camps. The situation has caused an appalling sanitation crisis. We may end up degenerating into a cholera outbreak.

“We really need a lot of water and sanitation support. We want the government to immediately come to the rescue of the people.”

The Uganda Red Cross Society says the immediate needs include shelter, food, bedding, mosquito nets, utensils, mobile toilets, water storage facilities and tarpaulins. It is appealing for more resources.

Oluka says overcrowding in makeshift centres had complicated efforts to combat Covid-19. “The guidelines have been compromised. I didn’t see anyone [displaced] in the camps with a mask. The leaders are telling people to maintain social distancing but it’s not attainable. There is overcrowding in camps.”

He adds: “I don’t think they are now bothered about coronavirus, which they haven’t seen. They are bothered about what has affected them now [floodings], safety from waters and their livelihoods.”

In its outlook for March to May, Uganda’s National Meteorological Authority warned of heavy rainfall over several parts of the country, which could lead to flooding and landslides, causing loss of lives, destruction of property and infrastructure.

Floods and landslides have killed 194 people in neighbouring Kenya and 65 in north-west Rwanda in the past week. On Sunday morning, there was another wave of flash floods in Uganda.

“We have looked at the magnitude of the problem. It is too huge. It requires immediate, medium and long-term interventions,” says Oluka.

“The government will look at shifting people from the dangerous areas in Rwenzori to safer areas when funds can allow.”","That night heavy rains in the area of western Uganda swept away homes, schools, submerged farms, cut off bridges and left several roads inaccessible, affecting 24,760 houses and an estimated 173,000 people, according to a disaster committee interim assessment report.

710,https://www.borgenmagazine.com/water-quality-in-uganda/,Water Quality in Uganda,"SEATTLE — Water is one of the most precious elements the earth has to offer. Without clean water, life cannot be sustained. Unfortunately, the water quality in Uganda is low and not accessible to nearly 60 percent of the population.

The country of Uganda has had to deal with internally displaced people as a result of the conflict initiated by the Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA). For more than 20 years, the LRA terrorized the people of Northern Uganda. When the conflict ended, citizens began trying to develop the land again. Those in IDP camps began rebuilding their lives. However, one of the major problems they faced was a lack of quality water.

Despite trying to move forward and recover, the people of Uganda have found that without water, the efforts are to no avail. With the lack of access to clean water, more than 22,000 children die each year from water-borne disease and over 4,000 children under five die every year from preventable diarrheal diseases. While efforts are being made to improve the issues, more help is needed.

With the lack of water, farmers have major issues as well: they cannot grow crops or earn their living. In addition, many Ugandans rely on the natural resources on the land to survive. With the removal of forests giving way to the agricultural land, the soil is exposed to erosion and loses fertility. There are also several nomadic communities in Uganda that are unable to have access to clean water and safe sanitation and are therefore trapped in poverty.

The crisis has called for the World Health Assembly to address the quality of water and sanitation in Uganda. The need for leaders to provide safe water and sanitation to fight diseases is pertinent. Women and children have to retrieve water from gutters and fill containers that were at one time holding fertilizers or oil. A lack of knowledge on water safety has led to people retrieving contaminated water, but many have no other choice.

Organizations such as Charity Water have been taking steps to help the water quality in Uganda. They have funded 564 projects and invested $6,620,150 to help Uganda. Some of the solutions they have implemented on the ground include drilled wells and rainwater catchments. Further, the organization WaterAid has partnered with local organizations to find appropriate and sustainable solutions for the different areas in Uganda.

Its surrounding areas are swampy, which is perfect for growing its staple cash crop: rice. But open defecation, pit latrines, and other pollutants captured in runoff contaminate the town’s swamps, ponds, boreholes, and hand-pumped wells.

Women and children used to spend massive amounts of time collecting water for drinking, cooking, and washing from these sources. They often had to walk miles with their empty jerry cans and buckets, and return with them full and weighing more than 40 pounds. This daily burden meant losing out on educational and work opportunities, which affected the economic well-being of generations of families. But the harmful bacteria, viruses, and other pollutants swirling inside their containers were an equally heavy burden.

“This affects the working population in the rural area. The mothers, when they’re sick, cannot be productive. Children don’t go to school when they’re not well,” said Michael Opagi, principal investment officer in IFC's Public-Private Partnerships (PPP) department in Sub-Saharan Africa.

But it was Opagi’s team at IFC that turned things around with a PPP solution, helping to transform the lives of thousands in Busembatia. Today, the community has clean, piped water. Women now have more opportunity to work, children go to school, and local businesses have a reliable utility.

In Busembatia, Uganda, a successful public-private partnership helped local banks finance a small-scale water project that provided thousands of people with a sustainable water supply system for the first time.



A Global Crisis

Nearly 90 percent of Uganda’s 35 million people live in small towns and rural areas, and roughly two thirds of them lack access to safe water. Poor sanitation worsens the problem. Waterborne diseases and infant mortality are widespread.

When the government of Uganda decided early last decade to decentralize rural water supplies and distribute grants to local governments to organize service, it awarded management contracts to private operators in dozens of towns. But most contracts were weak and the utilities have underperformed.

According to Stemma Kategeke of Busembatia’s town council, before IFC turned its attention to the town’s problem in 2007, the locally run situation was a “mess.” Service was virtually non-existent and there were zero prospects of improving things.

Opagi said that the contracts for the program in place in Busembatia were not well-structured and performance was underwhelming, with only a couple of hundred people being served. There was no ability to drill for new water and scale up the operation to manage bigger contracts, extending benefits to more people.

The challenges included the need to transform poor contracts already in place, increase the capacity of the local operators to scale-up their services, and overcome a critical lack of local finance. To tackle them, IFC harnessed existing World Bank Group support in Uganda from the Joint Water and Sanitation Sector Program and Global Program for Output-Based Aid (GPOBA). We also brought in the Public-Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility (PPIAF) to help find local solutions to Busembatia’s water problems.

A Local Solution

Among other priorities in Busembatia, getting local banks to believe in the viability of small-scale water PPPs was crucial. To address this, IFC and PPIAF brought together local financial institutions and small-scale water providers to learn from each other and come up with a viable business model for financing small town water operations for the first time, improving access to finance for small infrastructure projects.

The result? In 2010, three local companies were invited to submit a bid for a five-year management contract in Busembatia following a prequalification process. The contract was awarded to Trandint Limited. Trandint offered the lowest price at $270,000 and received a $100,000 loan from a local commercial bank, the first of its kind there. IFC also worked with GPOBA, which guaranteed a subsidy to pay for the project.

“IFC was directly involved in the evaluation, so we felt there was a level of transparency and this was a project worth going for,” said Phiona Rotaro, owner and operator of Trandint.

Water Flows

Trident has more than doubled the number of water stations, adding over 400 new connections. Today, some 700 stations distributing clean piped water have been installed in Busembatia, serving more than 15,000 people in and around the town.

With clean water flowing, new transparency and bankability facilitated by IFC has washed away the old problems plaguing the town’s water utility, opening a new chapter in Busembatia.

The project was supported by DevCo, a multi-donor facility affiliated with the Private Infrastructure Development Group. DevCo provides critical financial support for important infrastructure transactions in the poorest countries, helping boost economic growth and combat poverty.

“We’ve been given trust in the supply system,” said Rotaro. “So to me, I think IFC made us more mature in business and let banks gain confidence in us. This whole town is covered 24/7. Water is flowing.”

September 06, 2015

Every time Chrispus Twikirize, a student and resident of Kainamo in Ibaare, Igara Bushenyi goes to the well to fetch water for domestic use, he has no choice – he draws the same dirty water completely contaminated with solid wastes, algal blooms and toads.

“We have no choice. This is our only source of water. The quality is gradually becoming worse,” narrates Chrispus, a student of Ankole Western University in Sheema district.

Jeconeous Musingwire, an environment scientist with the national environment watchdog- NEMA says it is possible that the water that Crispus fetches from their well is full of mud, faecal matter; fertilizers and soil sediments.

The UN Water notes that deteriorating water quality has become a global issue of concern as human populations grow, industrial and agricultural activities expand, and climate change threatens to cause major alterations to the hydrological cycle.

What is more worrying is that surface water sources such as wells, lakes, rivers, streams and ponds which are vital sources of water for public supply in developing countries, are the ones that get contaminated easily.

In the rural and urban communities of South-western Uganda, surface water accounts for about 99% of the total public water supply in the region, according to Jeconeous. Up to three-quarters of water surface in the region is contaminated. Surface water is not clean for consumption,” insists Jeconeous.

“When showers come, the first run off is full of all sorts of dirt including human wastes due to open defecation. Animals also drink directly from these water points. And some latrines are shallow. Faecal matter from these latrines end up going into water sources,” narrates Jeconeous.

Water pollution is the major cause of several diseases – including typhoid, dysentery, hepatitis A, cholera and diarrhoea in developing countries.

According to the World Health Organization, up to 3.2 million children under the age of five in developing nations die annually as a result of unsafe drinking water and poor sanitation.

Water scientists insist that such deaths are bound to keep soaring unless people stop interfering with the water cycle such as through deforestation, destroying vegetation, encroaching on wetlands.

Charles Ngabirano, a water engineer says the water filtration capacity has been compromised.

“People have destroyed the vegetation cover, wetlands and trees which used to filter such water. What do you expect? All that running water collects on the way is now deposited into wells.”

Vegetation cover – wetlands in particular – act as nature’s kidneys. They filtrate water by removing sediments, pollutants, excess nutrients as well as retaining water which averts flooding.

Charles insists that all surface water must be treated before consumption, vegetation cover conserved and catchment areas preserved.

Additionally, Fredrick Muhanguzi, an agricultural value chain expert says farmers must desist from toxic agriculture practices.

Farmers should not cultivate on banks of water sources such as rivers. They need to practice proper farming methods that do not cause soils from hilly areas to slope down the hills and pollute water sources in valleys every time it rains.”

The lake, east Africa’s largest by area, also supplies water to millions in neighboring Kenya and Tanzania, and supports fishing communities in all three countries.

Gerald Sawula, deputy executive director of Uganda’s state-run National Environmental Management Authority (NEMA), told Reuters that the lake’s Murchison Bay, the northerly inlet on which Kampala sits, was becoming a “dead” zone.

“It is a real crisis, the water has turned completely green with algae blooms swamping the whole place,” he said.

“The water has become so thick from effluent that is being discharged directly into the lake because the wetlands that used to filter it have all been destroyed by developers.”

Fisheries experts say heavy concentrations of pollutants are killing certain fish species.

“As more algal blooms, phosphates, nitrates, heavy metals and fecal matter all pile into the lake, it’s going to be harder and harder to clean the water,” Sawula said.

“It’s very obvious that in future the National Water and Sewerage Corporation won’t be able to treat water from Lake Victoria to a level safe enough for domestic consumption.”

The local daily New Vision reported Monday that the utility was considering extending intake pipes far out into the lake as pollution near the shore exceeds treatable levels.

Though the Kilembe copper and cobalt mines ceased operations in western Uganda, the River Nyamwamba – the main water source for people in the area – is under threat of contamination.

Last year, geologist Alex Kwatampora was part of a team which found that harmful metals had washed down into the river from the mines.

""When we took samples from the effluents and indeed there are high levels of copper, some unacceptable levels of cobalt, zinc, nickel and these have effects to human beings,"" said Kwatampora.

The National Agriculture Research Institute reported that there's more contamination downstream, where the River Nyamwamba joins Lake George.

""I believe its copper turning these stones to a brownish colour and I think that is why people around this area are developing stomach illnesses,"" said Kasese resident Wasaka Maleu.

The resulting food shortages are posing great threats to the citizens and over a million refugees in the country.

In eastern Uganda, a region severely affected by drought, many families now eat only one meal a day. Margaret Okurut’s family is one of them: “We struggle to find just a day’s meal for me and my four children,” she says wearily.

Weather experts warn that the drought situation is far from over. The most hit regions are along the so-called “cattle corridors” stretching from western Uganda through the central region to Teso and Karamoja in the north-east.

The droughts greatly affect the agricultural sector, which is Uganda’s economical backbone. Farmers are counting losses after the food crops they planted either dried up or yielded very poor harvest.

The droughts have not spared the animals either; herdsmen are moving from community to community in search for pastures and water. They face rejection in some places, with ensuing conflicts over access to water. Cattle traders say they are making losses because the animals are weak, smaller and weigh less than usually.

Ben Obwoyo, chairman of the national chamber of commerce for Nwoya district, blames the droughts on “general climate change coupled with massive deforestation in most parts of the country”, but he also criticises poor farming practices. Obwoyo urges farmers not to panic and not to plant crops too early. “Farmers’ tendencies of rushing to plant with the first rainfall has to change. They must wait for enough rain,” Obwoyo explains.

Moreover, Stella Lutalo, a climate-change expert in the capital Kampala, advises farmers to plant drought-resistant crops in order to avoid losses and famine.

Uganda has suffered from droughts on and off in the past three years. The government is now appealing to regions with food to share grains with their neighbours. Ugandans are known for their solidarity, and as a short-term solution, locals recently mobilised funding and purchased tons of grains which were distributed to the worst affected community of Teso in eastern Uganda.

Trying to encourage farmers to counter the droughts, Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni demonstrated low-tech drip irrigation techniques by using plastic bottles filled with water, saying that “such innovations can save plants”. Although some people criticised his approach, vegetable grower Kigozi Martin of Wakiso in Central Uganda has adopted the bottle technique and is now earning cash from his vegetable business.

However, such innovations may save small-scale farmers, but it is too expensive for large-scale farmers. And on top, most water points have dried up in the droughts.

KARAMOJA- More than 700 animals in Karamoja Sub-region have died since December as drought hits the area, forcing many pastoralists to move for long distances in search of water and pasture.

Mr Francis Kiyonga, the district chairperson of Amudat, said: “Our people have lost cows and every day cows and donkeys are dying of starvation due to lack of water and pasture in the district.”

“As leaders, we are now not really sure of how to save the livestock because the pastoralists of Amudat, Nakapiripirit and parts of Napak always cross to the wetland areas of Lokilotor and Bunambutye at the border between Kween and Bulambuli districts during the dry spell, but a Chinese investor has converted the area into a rice Scheme,” he said at the weekend.

Mr Mark Apaloris, a pastoralist in Nakapelimoru Sub-county in Kotido District, said he has lost 10 cows to draught since December last year.

He described the drought as unfortunate, adding that several animals have become malnourished. He said Kobebe dam, which is the major source of water in the area, is about to dry up.

Mr John Dengel, another pastoralist in Moroto, appealed to the government to construct proper valley dams that can keep high volumes of water during the dry season.

“We thank government for constructing some valley dams, but most of these valley dams are shallow, they dry up very fast because they don’t keep much water,” he said.

Mr Paul Chemusto in Amudat said the main river, where they used to draw water for the animals, dried up. He appealed to government for immediate intervention before the situation worsens.

Mr Joseph Lomonyang, the Napak District chairperson, said the drought was the worst the sub-region had ever experienced.

“Imagine by April, Karamoja usually gets some rain but there is no rain, not even a single drop of water,” he wondered.

Mr Ambrose Lotukei, the Kotido District chairperson, said government needs to construct multipurpose dams that can act as water reservoirs for animals.

Mr Christopher Kibanzanga, the State minister for Agriculture, issued the warning in an interview with Daily Monitor

By PAUL TAJUBA

KAMPALA. The government has warned of impending famine in most parts of the country, cautioning traders to limit food exports and families to start food rationing.

Mr Christopher Kibanzanga, the State minister for Agriculture, issued the warning in an interview with Daily Monitor yesterday.

He attributed the looming famine to the delayed rain and drought that has stretched beyond March into April resulting in crop failure. “We are certainly not going to have enough food. Our appeal to farmers is not to take everything to the market,” Mr Kibanzanga said.

“Traders should take [sell] food to areas like eastern Uganda, northern Uganda and Karamoja sub-region which do not have food,” he added.

Mr Kibanzanga said government will support mini and large scale irrigation schemes across the country to minimise over-reliance on rain-fed agriculture as it is done currently.

At the beginning of March, the Uganda National Meteorological Authority (UNMA), the government agency for weather forecast, predicted that most parts of the country would receive plenty of rainfall. They said farmers were free to start planting their crops.

The forecast followed some occasional showers that enticed farmers to start planting crops, but the skies soon dried up and crops wilted under the scorching sunshine.

Mr Festus Luboyera, the UNMA executive director, later issued a statement attributing the current dry spell conditions to the tropical cyclone which last month ravaged Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Madagascar and left an estimated 1,000 people dead.

“The cyclone led to the development of low pressure system around the Mozambique channel which resulted in the weakening of southeasterly trade winds. These winds became diverted towards the channel, depriving moisture laden winds to reach our country which is why we have experienced the dry spells,” Mr Luboyera said in a statement.

Ms Agnes Kirabo, the executive director of Food Rights Alliance, a civil society organisation, said government should be blamed for failing to store produce of the previous season. “There was a dramatic bumper harvest but most of the grain, which would have been used in this bad season was wasted,” she said.

720,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/disa.12303,From disaster to devastation: drought as war in northern Uganda,"This paper proposes a shift from the concept of disaster to one of devastation when dealing with the destructive consequences of climate change. It argues that today, a discourse of climate‐change disaster has become dominant, in which present disasters are seen as harbingers of a future of widespread climate disaster, products of a global nature in upheaval. The paper contends that one needs to go beyond the series of dichotomies that the climate‐change disaster discourse relies upon: future/past, global/local, natural/social. To frame climate disaster as a product of global climate change, and conflict the product of those climate disasters, is to occlude the forms of environmental violence and experience of climate change among disaster‐affected communities. Through an exploration of the drought in Uganda, the paper asserts that disaster should be understood as embedded within ongoing, longstanding, multiscalar processes of devastation produced by histories of human engagement with the environment, including that of war.

Introduction: climate change and disaster Early 2017 saw drought hit northern Uganda, followed by extremely heavy rains towards the middle of the year (Anyadike, 2017; United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, 2017). Drought affected much of Eastern Africa in 2016 and 2017, and the disruptions to rainfall patterns are thought to be attributable, at least in part, to the effects of global warming. In the words of one climate scientist, ‘I most definitively think both the increasing temperatures and the decreasing rainfall in the spring are highly related to climate change’ (Funk, 2017; see also Oxfam, 2017). Admittedly, defining a causal link between particular weather events and anthropogenic global climate change remains difficult, as the controversy over ‘attribution studies’ demonstrates (IPCC, 2013). Nevertheless, the close identification of natural disasters with anthropogenic global climate change has rapidly solidified. Only a decade ago, an Oxfam report on northern Uganda cautioned that ‘scientists are not currently able to attribute these and other climatic alterations to man‐made climate change; African climates have always shown considerable variability and the influences on climates in Africa are multiple, highly complex and relatively poorly understood’ (Oxfam, 2008, p. 5). Today, however, Oxfam (2018) explains: ‘Simply put, changes in the global climate exacerbate climate hazards and amplify the risk of extreme weather disasters. Increase of air and water temperatures leads to rising sea levels … more intense and prolonged droughts, heavier precipitation and flooding. The evidence is overwhelming’. Concerning drought in East Africa specifically, Oxfam (2018) adds: ‘On the back of 18 months [of] drought caused by El Niño and higher temperatures linked to climate change, the Horn of Africa region is now going through a further drought, caused by a mixture of influences from La Niña and the Indian Ocean weather pattern. Millions of people are facing acute food and water shortages’. Even if the definitive attribution of any particular climatic disruption—and the resulting disaster—to global climate change still remains technically problematic at the moment, the association between natural disasters and climate change has been largely cemented, at least in much of public discourse. Indeed, it is rare to find an account of a drought, flood, or hurricane in the media that does not raise the possibility that it is a consequence of global climate change: as of this writing, the website of The New York Times (2017) features a story with the headline ‘the relationship between hurricanes and climate change’, with reference to Hurricane Harvey in August 2017. Whatever the difficulties of determining the etiology of specific weather events, each climate‐related disaster is seen to bear with it the ominous message that such disasters are going to increase dramatically in the future. Phenomena such as the East African drought are mobilised as evidence of the reality of global warming and of the need to mitigate climate change and to promote adaptation and resilience in preparation for inevitable future disasters (Hulme, 2009). Contemporary disasters, in this climate‐change disaster discourse, are therefore largely about the future; they are portents of what is to come, manifestations of the new global reality of a planetary nature out of joint. This paper draws attention to the impacts stemming from this incorporation of disaster into the global climate‐change discourse, both with regard to how disasters are comprehended as well as the politics and ethics of disaster‐oriented practice informed by that understanding. Conceptually, it asserts that incorporating disaster into global climate change establishes a series of dichotomies through which such events are viewed: future versus past; global versus local; and natural versus social. The first term of each of these pairs is privileged when disaster is integrated into climate change, so that the climate‐change disaster discourse places its emphasis on future disasters, on the global etiology of those disasters, and on their ontological footing within the realm of nature, even if that nature has been shaped by human activity. Heightened conflict, in this model, is among the future ramifications of climate disaster. This paper contends, however, that it is these dichotomies, and the overall climate‐change disaster discourse, that prevent understanding of how climate change and disaster are actually experienced in the very parts of the world declared as the most vulnerable. Instead, analysis needs to start with the experience of climate change and disaster in different locations and begin to reconstruct an understanding from those locations. This paper seeks to go beyond these dichotomies and to rethink the very concept of climate disaster by starting not from the hazard/vulnerability framework common in disaster studies, but from the lived experiences and the histories of climate change and disaster in specific parts of the world. Drawing on postcolonial environmental studies, it maintains that understanding climate change and disaster as they are faced in different locations requires that they be situated within multiscalar, plural histories of environmental violence, encompassing local, national, and regional dynamics along with the broadest set of global dynamics. War can be an integral part of these histories, and so one needs to incorporate conflict into understanding of climate change in new ways. To go beyond the limitations imposed by the dichotomies of future/past, global/local, and natural/social on understanding of climate change and disaster, this study proposes the concept of devastation. Devastation can comprehend better the phenomena that typically are seen as comprising climate change and climate disaster. The objective is to reframe climate disasters as comprised of specific aspects of longstanding forms of violence that exist within a complex matrix spanning past and future, global and local, natural and social. A turn to devastation can open paths towards an understanding and practice that is epistemologically, politically, and ethically adequate with respect to divergent global experiences of phenomena associated with climate change and disaster. This concept of devastation is explored using the case study of drought in ‘post‐conflict’ northern Uganda. The recent drought is situated in the context of broader processes of environmental devastation and violence, revealing how political violence is bound up with destructive environmental change in ways that demonstrate the limitations of the dichotomies of future/past, global/local, and natural/social.

Climate disaster between hazard and vulnerability The incorporation of natural disaster into climate change can be widely found in current policy documents. Representative of these is Uganda's National Climate Change Policy, adopted in 2015. ‘Most natural disasters that occur in Uganda are related to extreme weather events’ (GoU, 2015, p. 10), it explains, and so ‘Disaster Risk Management’ is ‘a frontline defence for adapting to the impacts of climate change’ (GoU, 2015, p. 27). The report speaks of climate change as ‘one of the greatest challenges facing humanity in the century’, and declares that it ‘is likely to disrupt the Earth's ecological systems and have serious negative consequences on agricultural production and productivity, forests, water supply, health systems and overall human development’ (GoU, 2015, p. v). Indeed, Uganda is already seeing some of these effects, the document reports: ‘the average temperature in semi‐arid areas in Uganda is rising’, as is ‘the frequency of hot days’, while rainfall is becoming less predictable and extreme weather events are intensifying (GoU, 2015, p. vi). As the policy attests, ‘Uganda has committed to the adoption and implementation of policies and measures designed to mitigate climate change and adapt to its impacts’, which requires ‘preparedness … in all sectors to ensure that the country is resilient to the adverse impact of climate change’ (GoU, 2015, p. v). Disaster preparation and risk reduction, in this framework, are thus about mitigating and minimising hazards while also addressing vulnerability. This reflects the dominant understanding of what constitutes a disaster: a natural hazard occurring in the context of economic, political, and social vulnerability (Wisner, Gaillard, and Kelman, 2011). Different approaches to disasters within the academic and policy literature may emphasise one or the other of these aspects (O'Brien and Eriksen, 2007; Methmann and Oels, 2014): highly hazard‐focused approaches may usually stress technical fixes such as improved seed varieties or securing critical infrastructure, while socially and politically informed treatments concentrate on ameliorating vulnerability (Blaikie et al., 1994). Indeed, vulnerability studies provide an important corrective to purely hazard‐centred approaches to disasters, pointing out how the spotlight on natural hazards can ignore the way in which vulnerability to climate disaster is produced ‘on the ground’, using Jesse Ribot's (2010) phrase. That is, without a history of economic and political deprivation and marginalisation, the hazards caused by climate change would not present the dramatic risk that they do to certain communities. The implication is that policy interventions that concentrate on adapting to natural hazards risk leaving unaddressed the economic, political, and social conditions that make communities vulnerable in the first place (Ribot, 2011). Hazards and vulnerability are found now in most treatments of climate disasters, including in Uganda's National Climate Change Policy (GoU, 2015). The distinction between natural hazard and social vulnerability becomes more polarised, however, as disasters become entwined with ideas of global climate change. With climate‐change disasters, a focus on globally‐produced climate hazards, and on global climate change as a kind of ultimate, universal natural hazard, endows the natural hazards side of the equation with new primacy (Ribot, 2014, p. 671). A clear line is drawn between the global and the local in the climate‐change disaster discourse, with weight shifting to the global as the location from where inevitable, overwhelming hazards originate and disasters are driven. The global is constructed in opposition to the local, with the latter conceived as the site where particular, delimited forms of vulnerability are found. Accordingly, bringing disasters within a climate‐change framework produces and relies upon a distinction between the global and the local, bound up with the distinction between the natural and the social: global climate change is seen to produce natural disruptions in climatic and meteorological patterns that, when extreme enough, intervene in contexts of local social vulnerability to create disasters. This implies a globally differentiated epistemology following North‐South lines. The global is the realm of objective universal truth, an object knowable through technical forms of natural scientific knowledge being produced in Northern laboratories mostly via computer models, in which the role of the rest of the world is to provide data (Edwards, 2010). The producers of this knowledge are also constructed as those who are themselves largely exempt from the consequences of climate‐change disaster, those whose resilience is high, who are above the rising water line. The local is the realm of social particularity, comprising those parts of the world that are said to be at risk of suffering the most due to future climate disasters. These ‘local’ areas in the global South are deemed to be excluded from producing or accessing universal knowledge of global climate change and become locations defined by varying degrees of socially‐produced vulnerability to these global forces. The local is constructed as divergent from the developed North through its vulnerability, defined by its lack of the North's resilience. It is constructed as knowable through humanities and social sciences, but those methods are only useful to discern local specificity, only the particularity of local vulnerability; they have nothing to say about universal global climate change or about transformations in nature. The dichotomy between global, natural hazard and local, social vulnerability in the climate‐change disaster discourse entails another dichotomy, that between future and past. A distinction is drawn between, on the one hand, disasters linked to increasing global climate change, and, on the other, disasters and broader environmental crises that are not directly connected to global climate change. The focus on climate change thus infuses an ethos of urgency into those disasters seen to be caused by climate‐change‐related hazards, as they rise to primary importance in domestic and international policymaking. The consequence is that past or present crises within ‘agricultural production and productivity, forests, water supply, health systems and overall human development’, as enumerated by the Ugandan strategy (GoU, 2015, p. v)—that is, instances of locally significant environmental destruction whatever their origin—are rendered invisible or less important by concentration on global warming and intensive preparation for global‐warming‐induced climate disasters. Non‐climate‐change‐related environmental violence or disaster can be incorporated into the climate‐change disaster framework only in a secondary role as contributors to vulnerability to climate‐change‐related disasters. In short, even as the vulnerability approach makes clear the need to take the past, the local, and the social into account, the climate‐change disaster discourse inevitably privileges the future, the global, and the natural. More fundamentally, however, it is the dichotomies themselves that may represent the greatest obstacle to understanding climate disaster today. Attention to the place of conflict—or, more broadly, violence—in the climate‐change disaster discourse can illustrate the need to go beyond these dichotomies. With the incorporation of disaster into climate change, an urgency comes to characterise interventions and policies seeking to deal pre‐emptively with the heightened conflict that is expected to arise from global climate change, from ‘climate refugees’ to ‘resource wars’. This can be clearly seen in the Ugandan strategy in the connection it draws between disaster and conflict. The report invokes looming conflict as a result of climate disaster: ‘Disaster risk management is also a key aspect of addressing socio‐environmental conflicts and human security concerns, both locally and regionally, in respect to environmental refugees and management of transboundary resources’ (GoU, 2015, p. 27). Disaster preparation is about preventing future conflict and insecurity caused by climate change. Despite important academic work questioning the linkage, the dominant understanding of the relation between climate change and conflict remains one of cause and effect: climate change is proposed as the cause of conflict though various mechanisms (Busby et al., 2013),1 most predominantly that climate change or heightened climatic variability increases resource pressures or introduces shocks to already vulnerable communities, members of which respond by turning to violence. The assumed existence of a stress‐response model can reinforce the inability to ‘move beyond linear connections’ between conflict and disaster and to embrace a ‘multi‐dimensional, context specific and historically relevant understanding of climatic disaster[s] and their impact on local politics’ (Siddiqi, 2014, p. 886). The assumptions behind this model are familiar from much of the writing on violent conflict in Africa: rebels are supposed to be rational actors who turn to violence as a way of ensuring access to resources for survival or profit, while rural populations face resource scarcity and are ready to turn to ethnic violence when that scarcity becomes too great (Verhoeven, 2014). It follows that interventions to promote adaptation and resilience to climate change are assumed to be needed as a mechanism of conflict prevention. Uganda is thought to be at special risk as a highly vulnerable African country; within Uganda, the north is often presented as the area with the most significant chance of climate change leading to conflict (Oxfam, 2008, p. 2; MER, 2015, p. 3). Past or ongoing conflict is included only insofar as it produces and exacerbates people's vulnerability to looming climate hazards (Wisner, 2011). A vicious circle is thus established: conflict social vulnerability (+ natural climatic hazard) conflict … What the paper seeks to show with the case of northern Uganda, however, is that political violence is not something that can be relegated to a future consequence of climate disaster or to a contributor to vulnerability. Instead, political violence is something that is already bound up with transformations in the climate, locally, nationally, regionally, and globally. This paper argues that a consideration of drought in northern Uganda illuminates how it can be understood as embedded within the legacies of war, as a form of violence that has continued into the post‐conflict period. Political violence has caused climate change and continues to cause climate change; or, perhaps more precisely, climate change is political violence, which becomes clear when one is able to get away from the dichotomies structuring the dominant understanding of climate disaster. Consequently, a focus on the relation between political violence and climate disaster can reveal the need to rethink the dichotomies and perhaps to go beyond the very concept of disaster.

From disaster to devastation The irony of the dichotomies embedded in the climate‐change disaster framework is that now, in the age of the Anthropocene, global climate change itself is understood to have rendered no longer viable the distinction between the natural and the social within climatic or environmental processes (Chakrabarty, 2009; Latour, 2014; Ghosh, 2016). The anthropogenic character of climatological transformations, as well as of broader disruptions in the biosphere, hydrosphere, lithosphere, and so on, means that a ‘natural’ hazard can no longer be taken to be natural in any essential way that fundamentally sets it off from the social processes that give rise to vulnerabilities. Various ways of comprehending the global co‐constitution of the natural and the social have been developed, such as Jason Moore's (2015) idea of a ‘web of life’, which entails broad histories of human‐nature interaction (see also Parenti, 2011). That fundamental distinctions between the natural and the social need to be rethought is not a novel argument today, given the rapidly expanding literature sparked by the debates around the Anthropocene. Nevertheless, it may feel somewhat out of place in the more operationally‐oriented disasters literature, in which meditations on the unstable ontology of earthquakes might appear an indulgence when faced with unstable buildings. Productive paths towards new understandings of climate change and disaster have been charted by those working in the ‘postcolonial environmental humanities’ and specifically within what Anthony Carrigan (2015) calls ‘postcolonial disaster studies’. For him, research and practice should ‘[t]reat postcolonial studies as a form of disaster studies and vice versa’ (Carrigan, 2015, p. 117), for it is ‘impossible in many cases to disentangle catastrophic experiences from colonial and neocolonial power dynamics’ (Carrigan, 2014, p. 4). Michael Niblett (2014, p. 109), drawing, like Carrigan, on the work of the Barbadian poet and literary scholar Kamau Brathwaite, explains that a tsunami, for instance, should not be understood as ‘an external force that impacts upon capitalist civilization, but as something constitutively implicated in its unfolding’. Both slavery and Hurricane Katrina, therefore, are ‘constitutive moments of a single unfolding spiral of catastrophe’, according to Niblett (2014, p. 109). For these critics, any particular disaster can be dissolved back into much longer histories and broader contexts of colonialism and capitalism, in which catastrophe is the dominant narrative. This postcolonial perspective reveals that large‐scale environmental disasters are not something that are yet to come from nature in a future of global climate change. Rather, for most of the world, disasters and dislocations are the reality of the present and have comprised centuries of the past. Hence, research needs to take account of ‘how environmental change is entwined with the narratives, histories, and material practices of colonialism and globalization. Postcolonial approaches emphasise how experiences of environmental violence, rupture, and displacement are central ecological challenges across the global south’ (DeLoughrey et al., 2015, p. 2). I agree that the processes that tend to be distinguished as climate disasters can be productively reframed within these longer histories of environmental violence, rupture, and displacement. However, I would look less to (global) colonialism and capitalism as constituting a single dominant narrative of catastrophe, within which specific events or processes need to be framed. Instead, I would maintain that understanding the environmental violence confronted in different locations around the globe requires that violence be situated within histories stretching across many registers, that confound the dichotomy between global and local by encompassing local, national, and regional processes along with sets of global dynamics (Peluso and Watts, 2001; Peet, Robbins, and Watts, 2011). In this way, the insights of Anthropocene thinking and postcolonial eco‐criticism can allow a move away from the dichotomies of natural‐social as well as of global‐local and future‐past that are being entrenched within the predominant climate‐change disaster approach, and in particular away from the privileged value placed on the first term in each pair. Instead, one can start, as eco‐criticism suggests, from the experience of climate disaster where and as it occurs, using that as a window on to the dense local, national, regional, and global forces, both natural and social, that congeal at particular points to cause widespread destruction or suffering through the environment. For a subsistence farmer whose crops are not growing, who faces a drought or a flood, it would not seem to matter much whether or not scientists can attribute that particular hazard to global climate change. By taking the farmer's experience and understanding of the environment as the starting point, instead of rising global greenhouse gas levels or deviations from scientifically‐determined climatological norms, one is prompted to reconceive climate change and climate disaster. Droughts and floods, whatever their origin, as well as the disasters they give rise to, are climate change in the sense that they represent the most important alterations to people's lived environments that affect their opportunity to survive and flourish. Furthermore, the environmental devastation that proceeds from deforestation, displacement owing to infrastructure development, oil extraction, rapid urbanisation, rural proletarianisation, or war are all wrenching, immediate, devastating forms of climate change for those who experience them, however attenuated their relationship may be to global warming. The present and the past are thus not ignored in favour of the future; the local is given equal standing with the global; and the social is seen as co‐constituted with the natural all the way down. Starting with these narratives is fundamental because what the environment is and how people relate to the non‐human world will be subject to many different visions, so determining what exactly the ‘climate’ is that is changing is crucial (Taylor, 2015). This signals the need to dissolve yet another dichotomy, that between climate change and disaster itself. In short, climate disaster can be seen not necessarily as a result of global warming caused by rising greenhouse gas emissions, as global and future‐oriented. Rather, climate disaster is represented by local, concrete, and present forms of devastation, interlaced with national, regional, and global processes, which matter to people, and which are transforming their environments and climates today. These forms of devastation can render environments uninhabitable in ways that are imagined only by the most dramatic of future‐oriented global climate‐change scenarios. The worst projected disasters of the future are already present for many of the world's poor, and have been so for decades or even centuries (Davis, 2002). Clearly, global warming will play a part in these forms of climate change and climate disaster, but this role can be understood only once a different orientation for the etiology of climate disaster is employed—one that does not look to rising global greenhouse gas levels and their future impacts, but rather looks to the past, to specific histories of environmental and social devastation that produce droughts or floods now. An attention to how natural and social processes are co‐constituting becomes increasingly important (Ingold, 2011; Taylor, 2015), and disaster can be de‐exceptionalised (Hilhorst, 2013). In place of the concept of disaster, Carrigan (2015) and Niblett (2014) seem to suggest catastrophe to capture this long‐term process of the natural and social onslaught of capitalism and colonialism. Catastrophe, however, may entail too much of a sudden, exceptional character; I would propose instead the concept of devastation, which places the emphasis on long‐ranging and lasting ramifications and can bring together a wide set of forms of violence within it. With a temporal dimension more akin to Rob Nixon's (2011) idea of ‘slow violence', but able to include periods of overwhelming, direct, atrocious violence as well, devastation entails both violence against people and against the land, plants, and air; it is the outcome of broad violence against ecologies in which human and non‐human are entwined. By beginning from the ways in which climatological disruptions are experienced and understood within environmental, political, and social histories, the category of devastation can avoid becoming simply an undifferentiated sweep of violence. Analytically, narratives of climate change and disaster among those experiencing them can reveal the economic, political, and social processes that produce devastation (Quarantelli, 1998; Oliver‐Smith and Hoffman, 2002, p. 18). The researcher can work to integrate those narratives into other narratives of climate disaster, which would include regional or global meteorological transformations and regional or global histories of capitalism, colonialism, and racism (Hage, 2017). The narratives created by researchers can be of use both to those immediately affected by a disaster as well as those working in the disaster prevention and response industry and the professional scientific community.

Drought as war The East African drought, therefore, is not best understood as a globally‐induced natural hazard affecting local vulnerability. Instead, it should be seen as embedded within ongoing, longstanding, multiscalar processes of environmental devastation and generated by equally multiscalar histories of human engagement with the material processes of the planet, which can be framed within numerous, but often overlapping, narratives of devastation. In northern Uganda, war provides the dominant narrative of devastation within which climate disaster and drought can be comprehended. Civil war raged in the region from 1986–2006, pitting the rebel Lord's Resistance Army against the Government of Uganda (Branch, 2011). The insurgency was infamous for its atrocities against civilians, but the government's counterinsurgency also was devastating. From 1996 in some locations, and from the early 2000s in others, the Government of Uganda forcibly displaced and interned the entire rural population of the Acholi sub‐region, comprising more than one million people, in wretched camps (Dolan, 2009; Branch, 2011). The forced internment created a humanitarian disaster, and led to widespread cultural, economic, and social destruction. Movement out of the camps and back to rural villages and homesteads began haltingly in 2007, following the conclusion of the war; in some places, it is still an ongoing process. War is thus part of the past, but its legacies shape the present and certain forms of war‐time violence continue into the present. Hence, the violence of the war, past and present, constitutes the dominant narrative for understanding the devastation that people face today, including in relation to the environment. As argued below, even drought, which the climate‐change disaster framework would associate with the natural and global, with its relevance for conflict residing in the future, can be seen as part of this history of war as devastation. Indeed, drought is commonly viewed as tied up with the violence of the war. As explained below, the state and the structures of violence that it supports, in the context of the devastation wreaked by the counterinsurgency policy of long‐term mass forced internment, are seen as responsible for the drought through one key route: the mass extraction of trees. Climate change can be understood as the set of wrenching transformations that have resulted from the broad legacies of the war as well as the continued forms of environmental violence confronted by the community at present. Instead of the vicious circle of conflict social vulnerability + natural hazard conflict …, a different relation between disaster and conflict can be posed. War is the primary framework for comprehending a devastation that incorporates what is understood by the climate‐change disaster discourse as social vulnerability plus natural hazard. This opens the way for a more complex appreciation of the relation between conflict and disaster, in which they are intertwined within multiscalar ecological, economic, and political processes. Again, in Uganda, this war is not the only history, and not the only narrative that matters. Indeed, global meteorological processes, themselves socially embedded, are part of the devastation. However, this narrative of war should assume primary position in understanding drought and framing responses to it instead of abstracting certain elements from that history needed to comprise the categories of ‘natural hazard’ and ‘social vulnerability’. With this revised interpretation of climate disaster, no longer are climate shocks seen as producing resource scarcity and consequently leading to conflict and insecurity. Instead of climate disaster causing local conflict within a global climate change framework, conflict might be viewed as causing climate change, or perhaps both the violence of disaster and the violence of conflict are elements of broader, longer‐term histories of violence. This also helps to qualify some of the more nuanced, empirically‐grounded studies of conflict and disaster: Siddiqi (2014, pp. 888–889) shows that these studies frequently present a natural disaster as opening up a political space into which either the state can reassert itself through aid provision and reconstruction assistance, or else the political opposition can establish its legitimacy by filling that gap. Climate disaster, in this sense, can spawn a change, therefore, from the legitimacy of one political regime to another (Pelling and Dill, 2010). In northern Uganda, however, the dynamic is different: it is not the state's response, or lack thereof, to climate disaster that has political meaning; rather, the drought itself is seen as political, as a continuation of state violence. By being part of longer processes of social‐natural devastation, climate disaster may not comprise a disruption, but rather an intensification of, and continuity with, these existing political arrangements and structures. Northern Uganda demonstrates that the effect of disaster is not necessarily to reorient people politically, but to confirm their political subjugation by an essentially predatory and antagonistic state and its agents, a subjugation that increasingly threatens the very basis of their livelihoods. People's desperation and insecurity in the face of state‐violence‐driven climate disaster thus does not lead to conflicts among rural people, but to a confirmation of their oppression by the state. One should not view potential future violence as resource conflict in response to climate disaster; instead, it should be seen as a continuation of the violence of the war, perhaps even involving new armed opposition to the state. Coming to terms with the shortcomings of the dominant climate disaster/conflict paradigm is important not only as a conceptual exercise. As climate change is increasingly perceived as the primary threat to development and security in Africa, climate change adaptation and resilience are coming to dominate the international governance regime (USAID, 2013). In Uganda, as in many other African countries, this policy shift towards climate‐change adaptation and resilience is still in its initial stages. Nevertheless, the dominant climate‐change‐centred understanding of disaster and conflict looks likely to have an increasing impact on the economy, political structures, politics, and people's lives.

‘Climate change’ in Acholi Disruptions to and changes in the environment were the major subjects of interviews and discussions conducted among rural communities in northern Uganda's Acholi sub‐region in 2017.2 Ongoing drought and broader problems with rain were raised consistently: less rain, especially during the planting seasons, was noted, but so too was the fact that when rain did come, frequently it was very powerful. Along with reduced rainfall there were periods of brighter sun that ruined crops. In addition, increased winds destroyed crops or homesteads, as did unusual weather events such as hailstorms. As an older woman explained in a focus group discussion: ‘In the past, rain would always come gently and smooth and the food would grow well; but now, you hear it has rained but the rain has destroyed gardens, and when the wind comes it is very strong and ends up blowing and destroying everything. Now the ground is just drying up. For me, those are the changes I see, and indeed there are many changes’. These changes to the weather, though, are not seen as isolated developments or as fundamentally different from other environmental changes that may not be related to global climate change. Indeed, the environmental transformations that people often explained as being the most important—what ‘climate change’ means in the context—seem to have begun as people returned home from government‐run internment camps. In most discussions, the division marking the beginning of the difficult present time is the departure from the camps and people's embarkation on an effort to re‐establish lives and livelihoods in an ecological, political, and social environment that had been torn asunder by two decades of brutal civil war and up to a decade of forced confinement. Contemporary conditions were almost always contrasted to the time before the phase spent in the camps, with the latter blamed for many current problems. As people returned from the camps in the late 2000s and early 2010s and sought to establish livelihoods in a radically changed setting, the challenges they faced in doing so became clear. First, the landscape itself was unfamiliar to the returnees after years away. Fields were overgrown, homesteads ruined, water sources destroyed, and many large trees, essential for boundary demarcation or orientation, as well as having cultural and spiritual importance, had been felled. New ‘security roads’ had been opened up by the Uganda People's Defence Force (UPDF), while old footpaths had been swallowed by the undergrowth (HURIFO, 2007). Landmines and unexploded ordinance were scattered, posing dangers to those clearing their fields or to children playing in the bush; the many people killed during the war had left certain areas considered dangerous and possibly haunted by spirits. Perhaps most difficult of all, people were returning to their land without cattle, which had been the primary form of wealth but had been looted during the early years of the war by cattle rustlers and the Ugandan military. In this hostile environment, people often described their surroundings, including the weather, as a force in opposition to them. The word that is typically used in the Acholi language to denote weather conditions is piny, as in piny lyet—it is hot—or piny ngic—it is cold. Piny can also refer to conditions of darkness or daylight or to one's surroundings more broadly, touching on its environmental, social, and even spiritual dimensions, given the deep meanings with which the landscape is invested (Finnström, 2008). A consequence of the war was that, as one person put it, ‘now the environment has become unfriendly’. Another expanded on these interlinked factors: ‘In the past when trees were not cut down, we used to carry out farming peacefully because our crops would grow well and there was no army. But now we came back from the camps, we lack water, our crops don't grow well, and we don't have money to pay fees for our children’. The aspect of this bad environment of most concern was the perceived falling productivity of land and the inability to survive from farming alone. As one person noted: ‘during that time before we ran off to camp, everything was okay, you would dig and your food would grow nicely. You would dig one acre [and] you would even get four bags, but now … even though you dig, there is no food that comes out’. Very concrete legacies of the war were identified as causing the fall in productivity. During the conflict, granaries had been destroyed and seed stocks lost, as had farming implements and household supplies. Many young people, having grown up in the camps, lacked basic knowledge of building homesteads or planting crops. Others identified toxic legacies of the war: ‘In our area here, there were very many bombs, so the chemicals from the bombs, sometimes we think, is what has brought trouble in this place’. People also blamed the chemicals reportedly being used by the expanding agricultural plantations, as well as the dust created by new quarrying works. The cause most commonly cited for declining productivity, however, was the destructive changes in weather patterns attributed to the massive loss of trees. There was some debate over the exact way in which cutting trees was leading to decreased rainfall and to drought. Some claimed the chainsaws were keeping the rain away; others pointed to the inability to perform the rituals that had brought rain now that the trees, the site of these practices, were gone. Yet others blamed the foreigners doing the cutting, contending that they were performing their own rituals to keep the rain away. Almost everyone to whom the research team spoke, though, agreed that the most important factor was the forests’ role in attracting rain and retaining water. Without forests, rain will not come, and, when it does fall, it will fail to soak into the soil and will drain away. As one woman put it: ‘The way I see it, piny is not as it used to be in the past. Back then, if the rain decides to fall, it shows that real rainfall is coming, even the air changes. The wind moves like this and then the trees could shield excess wind. But these days, they have cut the trees, the wind moves anyhow and now even the rain periods come and pass without anything happening. From January all the way to March, then it would start raining and go all the way like to June. Then two months after that, people start planting food in their gardens again. But now, you can go up to August like bang! … The sun is shining so bright and hot and there is no rain’. A group of women in a village in Amuru District added: ‘Yes, [tree cutting] is there. They cut almost everything, they started way from up there to all the way down. Now there's nothing; the rain has also gone silent and now, for us, we are dying of hunger because the ground has dried up. We are going to die of hunger, there is nothing to eat—you see this, they come and cut everything’. In a nearby parish, a similar account was provided: tree‐cutting ‘is ruining the forest. There isn't any forest anymore. You know that the forest also brings rain and prevents the wind. Now the forest isn't here to stop the wind and bring the rain’. One interviewee drew attention to differences with the past: ‘People dig by themselves for two to three years with nothing to gain from it. It is not that we don't dig, we do, but then it is the little rainfall we receive that is a problem and that is because of the trees’. This fall in productivity and decrease in rain has dangerous implications for the future. One person underscored that it is the ‘children who will suffer': ‘They will not have any trees left. It is the war that caused all these problems—in the past, people respected each other but now people do not do that anymore because people just cut down any tree on any hill they come across’. These negative consequences were not limited to declining agricultural productivity. Deforestation has harmed people's broader livelihoods, as the commons that all depended on for building materials, firewood, grazing land, and medicinal plants were destroyed. A group of young people in a nearby sub‐county stated that the loss of trees was also destroying the foundation of communal solidarity by erasing the physical reference points for traditional authority within the community. A spiritual devastation followed, as the homes of spirits and trees with significant historical resonance were cut and shipped off. One person predicted that, in five years, ‘this place will turn into desert’. These narratives of tree cutting are not to be understood as a ‘cultural’ interpretation of an ‘objective’ phenomenon, a ‘local narrative’ of a ‘global’ process of climate change (Daniels and Endfield, 2009; Taylor, 2015). Rather, the tree cutting itself, together with the destructive ecological, social, and spiritual changes caused by it, including drought, are the disaster; they are climate change. Yet, these destructive transformations in people's surroundings were themselves not isolated; they were connected to longer histories of political violence. Together, they form parts of a narrative of devastation focused on the violence of the war, past and present. And so, to understand the drought and its consequences, as well as climate change, one needs to explore the history of these cultural, ecological, political, and social developments to grasp how drought is constituted as a social‐natural phenomenon, part of a history of devastation. Central to comprehending these histories today is charcoal.3

The war against trees While hardwood timber extraction, the spread of commercial farming, and the expansion of grazing lands were all cited as factors causing the loss of forests, one culprit was dominant: large‐scale charcoal production. The recent and still expanding industrial production of charcoal was widely blamed for the mass extraction of trees and the clear‐cutting of forested land. As one woman explained: ‘For me, I see that the time that charcoal burning was so much was in the year that just ended. There was a lot of charcoal burning, it was really too much; it was almost taking place every day’. Another emphasised that ‘because of charcoal burning, hunger has come in. Charcoal has thrown hunger our way’. These sentiments were repeated in discussions across the region. Grasping the origins of charcoal production requires exploring the demand for charcoal, the modes through which rural communities have been incorporated into it, and the larger trade networks that enable its generation and marketing. Charcoal production and trade are immediately related to the war and its legacies, whereas the demand for charcoal is determined largely by national and international political economies. The drought is, in this sense, spawned by forms of violence that emerged and were consolidated during the war and that are part of a longer history of devastation, while also being integrated into global political economies of energy. Increasing demand for charcoal is a product of Uganda's rapid urbanisation (United Nations Development Programme, 2013); more than 80 per cent of the population of Kampala, the capital, and other urban centres is reliant on charcoal for meeting energy needs (Ministry of Energy and Mineral Development, 2016; Mukwaya, 2016). For years, most charcoal came from the central region, but with the end of open fighting in the north in 2006–07, a vast new reserve of trees for charcoal production was made available (Ministry of Energy and Mineral Development 2016; Miteva et al., 2017). As people moved back home after the war, having lost their cattle and savings, they were in need of cash to rebuild their lives and to pay school fees and for other essential services. Hence, people turned to charcoal production. At first it was largely small‐scale and based on household labour. However, an industrialised mode of production began to take over within a few years. Charcoal dealers started to bring in their own work teams, which they place in camps to clear‐cut large swathes of forest using chainsaws. Large trucks ply the remote dirt roads and tracks, ferrying workers and supplies in and innumerable sacks of charcoal out. Hundreds of migrant workers can clear many kilometres of land, extracting even the roots of trees, and leaving behind cratered landscapes of burning pits and the few scrub trees and bushes too small to burn. One parish chief claimed that the damage caused by commercial charcoal producers was so great that when land had been cleared of trees and used as a burning site, planting could not occur again for 10 years. Now, almost 40 per cent of Uganda's supply of charcoal to urban areas is reported to come from the north, whereas a decade ago it was negligible (Ministry of Energy and Mineral Development, 2016, p. 57). Available statistics on the scale of production are dramatic: in 2014, it was reported that Amuru and Gulu Districts’ forest cover had been almost halved since 1990, and 4,000–5,000 bags of charcoal are estimated to be removed from just one district every week (Acholi Times, 2016a). Charcoal has come to comprise a ‘violent environment’ (Peluso and Watts, 2001), centred on a specific ‘resource complex’ (Watts and Peluso, 2014). The dominant picture of the charcoal trade painted in the literature tends to posit a highly decentralised, fragmented sector with little vertical integration (Zulu and Richardson, 2013). In northern Uganda, though, the production of and trade in charcoal appears to be directed from the top, driven and made possible by the involvement, sometimes direct, of the state and the UPDF. As one informant underlined: ‘The people who bring their workers … to produce charcoal here are military commanders’. People often cited the presence of armed men among the burning teams and transporters, as well as the involvement of military personnel without uniforms. Another person commented: ‘The government workers give the rich people permission to cut the trees so that even if you complain, nothing will be done for you…. Those people have security that we can't stop’. Local government officials spoke about arresting illegal charcoal dealers and impounding their charcoal, only to get a call from military headquarters demanding that the person be released. Human rights activists reported receiving threatening telephone calls when they were seen as interfering with charcoal dealers or traders. Similarly, after the Local Council 5 Chairman of Amuru District, Michael Lakony, imposed a total ban on production, he announced that he had been threatened. He warned that: ‘I have names and recorded voices of the big persons in government and the army which I will expose if they continue’ (Acholi Times, 2016b). In sum, there is a widespread perception that those with power can grab land or extract trees for charcoal with impunity. The involvement of the state and the UPDF means that the devastation caused by tree cutting, and the drought to which it is seen as leading, is widely understood as a continuation of the violence of the war and encampment. As one informant pointed out, the community was now experiencing the ‘war that has been waged against trees’. The end of the conflict did not mean the end of state violence in the north; instead, it simply took on different forms. Those controlling tree cutting frequently are identified as the very people who were at the forefront of the state's counterinsurgency in Acholiland. Uganda's military has long been accused of looting natural resources, especially in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo and southern Sudan, contributing significantly to the consolidation of Uganda's business/political/military elite (Sjögren, 2013). The military seems to have brought these practices back to northern Uganda. The officers who were operating in Acholiland returned with peace to start exploiting its natural resources. There had been a small amount of logging of hardwoods during the war, but this looting escalated dramatically in the post‐war period. In some cases, the post‐war extraction of trees for charcoal and timber followed exactly the same routes as had the counterinsurgency: many of the security roads that were cut by the UPDF during the war to allow its military vehicles to reach remote locales are now the very roads that are being used to extract charcoal and timber. The militarisation of the north has continued, therefore, into the post‐war period, as the same forces that had been involved in the devastation of the war—the government, the outsiders who were its agents, and collaborators within northern society—are now blamed for the deforestation that has produced drought. Moreover, tree cutting has brought with it other forms of state‐driven environmental violence, other forms of climate change as war. Most notably, land grabs for commercial farming are widely reported. Sugar cane plantations have attracted the most notoriety: one case has seen years of struggle between the community and the Madhvani Group, backed up by state security (Martiniello, 2015). But it is not just extreme cases where state violence is involved; as one person noted: ‘the local people just wake up and find investors here, ploughing land without even knowing where they came from and for how long they would be staying here because of the connections the landowners have’. Military force is apparently used to guard some commercial farms belonging to elites, and people assert that some who had opposed giving land to plantations had been threatened or arrested. Land that was formerly part of the commons has been enclosed, and environmental pollution is reported near plantations, including damage to water supplies, thought to be a result of the use of chemical fertilisers, herbicides, and pesticides. Another source of widespread environmental concern in the community is the arrival of large herds of cattle, brought by truck from the south and left to graze on land either leased or otherwise accessed by the cattle owners. These herds are blamed for intensive degradation of the land and for destroying crops and fragile communal areas. Like the charcoal dealers, the cattle keepers are largely considered to be untouchable because they are armed and because of their reported military and government connections. Even relations with wildlife have been incorporated into the matrix of political violence. Elephants have been leaving Murchison Falls National Park and destroying crops and threatening human life. People widely believe that the recent rise in oil exploration and traffic through the park is to blame for the frequent elephant incursions. Some who fight back against the elephants have recounted violent reprisals by park rangers for any suspected harm done to animals. Many communities said that they felt that their livelihoods and lives were being sacrificed by the government for the interests of the oil companies. Game parks, in particular Murchison Falls, are becoming increasingly militarised, and game wardens are seen as the agents of dispossession and state violence (Carmody and Taylor, 2016).

Vulnerability and adaptation to devastation Drought in northern Uganda cannot be viewed as an isolated phenomenon, as a climate disaster caused by global climate change producing natural hazards that intervene in contexts of local vulnerability. Instead, it has to be seen as part of much broader regimes of devastation in which the dominant history is one of war, regimes that span the social and the natural, the global and the local, and the past and the future. Rather than treating conflict as something that either results from a future of global climate change or that contributes to local vulnerability, it should be seen as spanning both, dissolving the line between global natural hazard and local social vulnerability. The particular hazard at work in this case—drought and changing rainfall patterns—was produced locally by social forces as much as it was produced globally by natural forces (which, in the Anthropocene, were themselves also shaped by social forces). Vulnerability cannot be thought of as something purely local, as there was nothing purely local about the war in Uganda nor about the significant support that the Ugandan government has received from international donors over the past two decades, making possible the conflict and contemporary militarisation. Also stretching far beyond the local are the economic and political interests advancing the extraction of trees. A case in point is the international political economy in which East Africa's urbanisation is being pushed forward relentlessly, but energy for it must come from the massive, destructive dispossession of forests, requiring state violence to be effected. Even global warming can be conceived of as a form of violence, whether the violence of decades of extractive, unequal capitalist development, or, even more directly, the emissions generated directly by the military‐industrial complex (Fressoz and Bonneuil, 2016). Climate change itself does not exist purely in the global sphere, but rather, it is occurring through myriad forces that must be defined, starting from the experience of those living amidst it. And so global climate change also must be reconceived—there are certainly transformations happening to planetary systems that can be discerned using scientific methods, but global climate change is also the aggregate of many forms of climate change taking place in locations across the globe. This means that the firm distinction between future environmental disaster and past vulnerability needs to be dissolved, too. Today's drought, once placed in its ecological, historical, and social context is embedded in the ongoing legacies of the war, but it is also one aspect of a much longer history of devastation, stretching from violence between slave traders and different armed clan groups, to the so‐called pacification effort of the British and its forced population displacement, to the violence of the Idi Amin era, neoliberal structural adjustment, and extractivist ‘development’ now. Drought, and the broader devastation faced by communities after the war, thus crosses the divides between natural and social, global and local, future and past, but not just along the lines of hazard and vulnerability. Both armed conflict and drought can be seen as parts of a long history of devastation that is punctuated by periods of armed violence and atrocity. To focus attention primarily on future disasters stemming from the natural hazards resulting from global climate change, and on the conflicts to which they might give rise, is to ignore, and do injustice, to this long legacy of violence and war. It is also to disregard the narratives of climate change, drought, and devastation among those who are affected by these disasters, and to pay no heed to what they present as needing to be solved to ensure that there is a future. Adaptation, resilience, and preparedness as part of the climate‐change disaster model thus have the potential to lock in precisely this reality of devastation. Interventions can place existing economic, political, and social conditions beyond question, outside of the realm of what can be addressed by climate‐change‐focused policies. In fact, these interventions can even entrench the existing economic, political, and social order by endeavouring to increase its resilience and to help it adapt (Barnett and O'Neill, 2010; Brown, 2011; Ribot, 2014). Violence is placed beyond question and prevented from being addressed justly; adaptation and resilience threaten to preserve the unjust order created and enforced through violence. To understand the relation between climate change and conflict as cause and effect may itself reproduce devastation as it informs policy interventions. The challenge is to ensure that the response to climate disasters prepares for the future by building on just engagement with the violence of the past and the present.

However, farmers' coping strategies and their determinants remain under–documented. In this study, we: 1) characterise relationships between perceptions of drought and food insecurity and corresponding household coping responses, 2) compare livelihood characteristics of farmers that perceived food insecurity as a problem and those who did not, and 3) investigate how household-level characteristics correspond to household coping strategies. Our study is exploratory in nature: we administered a questionnaire to 140 farmers in Isingiro district in South-west (SW) Uganda whose livelihood is predominantly dependent on crop production. We employ binomial and multinomial logistic regression models to identify the determinants of the respondents’ perceptions, how household characteristics correspond to household perceptions of food insecurity, and factors that affect coping responses. Our data show that 68.6% of the respondents perceived food insecurity as a problem in their household. Access to credit for crop cultivation increased the likelihood (p < 0.05) that farmers will be more aware and concerned about household food security status. Farmers were more likely to use the credit as a buffer against food insecurity. Whilst drought is widely perceived (by 95.6%: 133) as a problem contributing to food insecurity, the coping responses are wide-ranging. However a considerable 13% (of the total) reported to be “doing nothing” to respond to the drought effects. Notably, farmers that did not perceive food insecurity as a problem have higher (p = 0.01) off-farm incomes and larger (p = 0.00) farm sizes on average compared to those that did. Significant (p < 0.05) determinants of coping strategies include a combination of size of farmland, total income from crops, number of livestock and marital status. Broadly, our study indicates that households believe they are most at–risk of drought–induced food insecurity. Access to credit and alternative means of livelihood may offer resilience building options.","Food insecurity is a region–wide problem in Sub-Saharan Africa, exacerbated by severe drought, with devastating impacts at the household level.

This study has shown that drought is a major cause of food insecurity at household level in Karamoja subregion. This is exacerbated by the poor household socioeconomic conditions. These patterns could be attributed to the fact that most households in the subregion are impoverished and with low education levels [18, 22]. This makes them unable to purchase food, a situation closely associated with poverty [6] in several agriculture-based rural areas. Although Karamoja subregion has faced food insecurity since 1964, and depended on relief food, [7], one would have expected a considerable change as of today following several interventions in the region aimed at security food security. However, this study has shown that several of these interventions have not led to food security in the region as most of the households continue to whirl in food deficits. Previous studies in the region and elsewhere in the semiarid areas have linked food insecurity in these areas to drought Vlassenroot et al. [34] and Turyahabwe et al. [35] events.

This study has showed that the sociocultural practices by the agro-pastoralists have placed women as more vulnerable to food insecurity. This is more evident with an average household size of 10 members, higher than the national average size currently at 6 members [22]. During times of scarcity, it is the women and children who are more affected by food insecurity. This is because culturally in Karamoja subregion, it is the role of women to fend for their families that is to bring food to the table. The role of the man is basically to look after livestock and provide security to the family. It is the sole role of women in Karamoja to carry out land tillage or crop production. However, currently the livestock has reduced due to the conflicts/raiding situation has caused this men to wake up in the morning and lie idle under trees the whole day while the women are struggling with household chores including “manyatta” or hut construction.

Ownership of more land by participating households is accounted for by the initial criteria for selection of the participating households. NGOs generally tend to select those who can be able to implement their project activities. That means working with people with access to land. However, the more land tilled by the participating households’ mean they developed more interest in crop production due to training and exposure outside Karamoja. The situation in Karamoja is that most of the households predominantly have pastoral livelihoods. Crop production is still something that they are just adjusting to do.

As coping strategies for food insecurity, the households tend to use dregs from local beer as food, collect wild fruits and vegetables, and use money from sale of firewood, water, grass to purchase food. From the coping strategies, one may argue that they mainly depend on natural resources as coping strategies. The main source of livelihood for pastoralists is livestock that has been affected by the current practice of protected kraals by Uganda Peoples Defense Forces that involves keeping all the animals in one big kraal against the cattle rustlers. This view was alluded to by the study on pastoralists in the same region [16]. All this limits access of the livestock resource by the other household members at home. During times of plenty, which is usually after a good year of harvest, households tend to carry out most of the postponed rituals of feasting: naming of new born, initiation into adult hood for the boys, marriage ceremonies and appeasing of the small gods. These kinds of ceremonies tend to exhaust most of the food harvested, and within a few months, the communities are food insecure again. With such practices, one would argue that their cultural practices in addition to drought make them more prone to food insecurity.

Ownership of more land by participating households is based on the initial criteria for selection of the participating households. It is a practice by NGOs to select those who can be able to implement their project activities the “resource-poor.” However, the more land tilled by the participating households’ would mean they developed more interest in crop production due to training and exposure outside Karamoja through tours for example to Teso subregion. The situation in Karamoja is that most of the households are still stuck to their traditional livelihood of pastoralism where livestock is the main resource. Crop production is still something that they are just adjusting to do.

Effect of DEWS on household food security and household dietary diversity

DEWS participating households have a significantly different HDDS of 9.0 compared to 6.6 for non-participating households and a significantly higher household food insecurity access score of 8.2 for the non-participants of DEWS intervention compared to 7 for their counterpart who were DEWS participating beneficiaries. This means that DEWS participating households are better off than the non-participating households as far as food access, availability and utilization are concerned.

To enhance the ability of the drought early warning system calls for further trainings on drought management, information from the early warning system and support with improved seed [16, 18], watering cans for mini-irrigation and exposure through participations in workshops within and outside Karamoja enabled them to get insight of what others do to enhance food production.

The trainings and information they receive from DEWS enabled them to diversify production. Similar findings on farm diversification can positively improve household food security and nutrition outcomes by increasing household’s access to diversified diets and to nutrient-rich foods [36] from own production. This includes growing drought-tolerant varieties that guarantees harvest hence food security. Although diversification per se is not sufficient in ensuring household food security and nutrition as Kikafunda et al. [37] noted, there are areas where total amount of food seemed to be sufficient, but with households not achieving a diversified diet.

Others factors that significantly increased the HFIAS were distance to water source and number of acres owned. This is due to the time spent on looking for water instead of doing food generating activities since water is used for both domestic and mini-irrigations of vegetable gardens.

The scenario that an increase in number of acres owned by households increases the food insecurity situation for that household could be as a result of most households with big numbers of acres of land use it for grazing livestock in a communal way. Also in such an environment, crop production turns out to be very expensive, and households involved in crop production have to fence off their crops with reeds and thorns to prevent destruction by animals. Although a study by Faridi and Wadood [38] found total land owned by a household a significant positive impact on food security status, the finding of this study might be unique to the context of Karamoja subregion where cultural practices do not add to food access, since cattle is mainly kept for prestige and very few can afford to sell livestock to buy food as indicated in Table 3.

On the other hand, findings show that a unit increase in the number of acres put to use within the household for crop production reduces HFIAS by 24% and the distance to the trading center reduces HFIAS by 19%; one study [39] also reported that increasing the land area allocated to crops can improve the food security of rural farm families. Similarly, as the distance to the trading center increases, households become more food secure; the explanation for this is that the further the trading center, the better, as this means that the households do not spend a lot of their time in the trading centers drinking, but remain home tilling land and less food can be sold during the times of plenty.

Participation in DEWS, education level, distance to the trading center all positively significantly affected the HDDS of the households (Table 7). In Ethiopia, Gebre [40] found a positive relationship between education level of household head, asset possession and access to employment, credit services and household food security. In general, this study implies that DEWS project increase both dietary diversity and anxiety of food insecurity. This is due to more food crops of the improved varieties being grown by the DEWS households as compared to the participating household who majorly are involved in growing mainly traditional food crop of sorghum. This can be attributed to the fact that the DEWS households have more information on droughts that push them to store more food for any eventuality compared to the non-participating households who lack information on droughts. Basing on the Karamoja subregion context, the issue of diet is not very key, what is very important is being able to secure a meal. Although most of the households could have access to milk and blood from those who own Livestock, the practice of moving far with livestock in search of pastures and water keeps the households far from the resources.","Although Karamoja subregion has faced food insecurity since 1964, and depended on relief food, [7], one would have expected a considerable change as of today following several interventions in the region aimed at security food security.

RACHEAL NINSIIMA

For 10 days, I travelled across the parched, drought-hit Kaabong district. The scorching heat, withered vegetation and dust-filled gusts of wind hint on the district’s former green glory. With no shower of rain in the past two months, rivers have dried up and pastoralists now move longer distances than usual. One Kaunda, a resident of the district points towards a river that has been reduced to a sand deposit. As we make our way through the river, sights of animals struggling to suck up water trapped in small wells is unmistakable.

Kaunda, a shepherd, is one of the hundreds of Karamoja region residents struggling after a strong El-Nino led to reduced rainfall in the region.

“I have had to travel about five kilometers further than what I usually travel in search of water for my animals. Farmers are reaping losses after sorghum and maize fields are dying up rapidly,” he tells me.

The escalating change in Uganda’s climate as witnessed by prolonged droughts and irregular rainfall patterns is undoubtedly demanding attention.With current average temperatures expected to increase up to 1.5°C by 2020, the frequency and severity of these hazards will increase. Moreover, climate change has the potential to halt or reverse the country’s development trajectory which is 80 per cent dependent on agriculture. This is because it is likely to increase food insecurity because of shifts in the productivity of agricultural and natural resources. The situation is worsened by the poor adaptation mechanisms of the population to the effects of climate change.

MPs ORIENTED IN CLIMATE CHANGE

It’s upon this background that an orientation meeting for members of parliament (MPs) was organized. The one-day orientation session was organised by the Uganda Parliamentary Forums on Climate Change (PFCC-U), Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR), and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), in partnership with the Office of the Prime Minister, UNDP, and the Africa Climate Change Resilience Alliance (a consortium made of CARE, OXFAM, World Vision and Save the Children).

The session was organised with the objective of increasing MPs understanding of the linkages between disaster risk reduction, climate change and sustainable development, as well as the critical role legislators’ play in realizing risk-informed development.

“One in 19 people developing countries are adversely affected by climate change effects compared to one in 1500 and this is attributed to ill preparedness. It’s not only equipment that we need as a country to address this issue but also a legal framework,” said Paul Isabirye in his keynote address. He is an expert from the Uganda National Meteorological Authority (UNMA).

Gilbert Kamanga, the national director of World Vision Uganda, urged members to consider incentivising alternative energy sources, thereby reducing the demand for charcoal and less environmental impacts.

Also addressing the session, the UN Resident Coordinator in Uganda, Ms. Rosa Malango, called on MPs to prioritize putting in place legislation to re-enforce Uganda’s world-leading National Policy on Disaster Preparedness and Management.

MPs SAY

Hon. Jennifer Namuyangu, the Kibuku woman MP, called on members to take on the issues of climate change and disaster risk head on, so to build public awareness and support for risk reduction and management measures. Hon. Esther Davinia Anyakun, the MP for Nakapiripirit, highlighted the need for better planning to anticipate and respond to increasing levels of disaster risk.

BUDDING SOLUTIONS

Hon Musa Ecweru, the Minister of State for Relief and Disaster Preparedness told attendants that government had developed hazard maps for all districts to raise awareness and empower leaders to make risk-informed decisions across all areas of local development.

“The Office of Prime Minister wants to strengthen district disaster committees to interpret phenomenons and channel data to relevant authorities,” Ecweru said.","Ugandan farmers suffering as devastating floods, drought hitMPs oriented on climate changeRACHEAL NINSIIMAFor 10 days, I travelled across the parched, drought-hit Kaabong district.

Abstract: Waterborne diseases are the most prevalent infectious diseases in developing countries especially in the rural areas. This

study aimed to investigate the occurrence of waterborne diseases in relation to the microbial water quality in Nakaloke sub county

Mbale district eastern Uganda. Patient records were collected from Nakaloke health Centre III cover a period of five years (2010-2014).

The results showed general distribution of selected waterborne diseases in Nakaloke Sub County. 3045 waterborne cases were review ed

and 1926 cases were found in the selected villages. Diarrhoea is the most common waterborne illness among the population in all

villages accounting for 837 cases followed by skin infection with 453, gastroenteritis 258 and dysentery 213, typhoid 148 and chol era 17

respectively. Forty five water samples were collected from three protected springs well for the village of N akaloke, Kireka and Nandala.

The samples were monitored for microbial contamination. Children of age group 0-5 years were found more susceptible to all selected

waterborne diseases. Women are more prone to waterborne diseases compared to men, Nakaloke village accounted fo r the highest

incidence than other villages of the study.

Keywords: Waterborne diseases, diarrhoea, gastroenteritis, dysentery, and water quality

1. Introduction

Water is indispensable for human health and well-being, and

is crucial for achieving sustainable development. Although

water is e ssential for life, it can also cause devastating

effects as an effective carrier of pathogens, capable of

transmitting diseases to a large amount of the population. [1]

Waterborne diseases and death continue to be a worl dwid e

burden in both developed and developing countries. Much of

the world’s population lacks access to sufficient and sa fe

water supplies. [2] According to UNICEF and WHO [3]

Worldwide, 780 million people do not have access to safe

water, and an estimated 2.5 billion people in developing

world lived without access to adequate sanitation. T he WHO

estimates 6.3% of all deaths are caused by limited access to

safe drinking water, improved sanitation facilities and

hygiene practices as well as water management that reduce

transmission of waterborne illness. [4]

Waterborne diseases result from ingestion of water

contaminated with microbial pathogens fro m human or

animal waste. Swallowing of water in the river by swimmers

may also result in infection although this is not a major

pathway. [5] Pathogenic organisms of concern include

bacteria, viruses, protozoans and some helminthes. A

number of waterborne diseases such like diarrhoeal illnes s,

cholera, typhoid skin infections etc. are kno wn to cause

health effects, varying in severity from mild gastroenteritis

to dysentery, hepatitis and shigellosis [6] . A large number of

people in de veloping countries mostly live in extreme

conditions of poverty and poor sanitation services in public

places as well as inadequate water supply and poor hygiene

including hospitals, health centers and schools. [7]

In the context of Uganda, WBD have been reported to be

among the major public health problems. This is mos tly

associated with poor hygiene and environmental sanitation

as well as poor supply of safe water. [8] In Ugan da mo st of

the rural populations obtain their wa ter supplies from

unprotected water, underground water, strea ms, spring wells,

ponds and lakes. [9] Developing countries have a huge burden

of waterborne diseases, the heaviest being diarrhoeal

diseases. Uganda as a tropical and developing co untry is

frequently subjected to waterborne di sease out breaks in

many regions. [10]

Introduction. Waterborne diseases constitute a major public health burden in developing and underdeveloped countries. Consumption of contaminated water causes health risk to the public, and the situation is alarming in rural areas. The objective of this study was to assess the contamination potentials of different house water handling and storage practices in the Kirundo subcounty, Kisoro District, Uganda. Material and Methods. A cross-sectional and descriptive study in which 344 water samples were collected randomly and analysed for bacteriological contamination, total coliforms (TCs) and Escherichia coli per 100 ml, using the Most Probable Number (MPN) technique and reported in terms of CFU/100 ml. Results. The 43.2% samples from unprotected water sources had total coliforms and 34.1% had Escherichia coli. In analysed household drinking water, 25% had total coliforms and 8.7% had Escherichia coli. Most drinking water sources were found to have coliform counts above the recommended national and international guidelines. There was a statistically significant difference among water sources with respect to total coliforms and Escherichia coli ( ). Conclusion. The overall results indicated that there is a strong linkage between microbiological water quality and water source sanitation; hence, the protected water source was safer than unprotected water sources. For the unprotected water sources, protection strategies as well as monitoring are recommended for this community.

1. Introduction

Access to clean and safe water, good sanitation, and hygiene practices are necessary for a healthy population [1]. Whereas the right to safe drinking water is a human right, one-sixth of the world’s population cannot access safe drinking water, predisposing communities to the risk of waterborne diseases [2]. Globally, 700 million people lack access to safe drinking water and half of these are in sub-Saharan Africa, where WHO estimates that 1.8 billion people drink water contaminated with Escherichia coli, which is an indicator of faecal contamination [3]. In third world countries, 80% of all diseases are directly related to poor-quality drinking water largely attributed to contaminants originating from unsanitary conditions [4].

Availability of healthy drinking water sources is a main concern in many countries around the world [5]. Contamination of drinking water is one of the greatest public health problems worldwide particularly in developing countries [6] and may be severe at the household level [7, 8]. If public health measures for safe drinking water and adequate sanitation are not enforced, water-related diseases such as cholera, dysentery, salmonellosis, and typhoid can erupt, especially in developing countries where millions of lives are claimed every year [4, 9, 10]. Globally, unsafe water coupled with poor sanitation kills at least 1.6 million children under the age of five years, 84% of them living in rural areas [11, 12].

Drinking water quality in the distribution network is paramount [13], and several studies have reported on microbial safety of water sources [1, 3, 4]. Such studies stimulate programmes aimed at safe water supply to communities, thus improving public health and reducing waterborne disease burden. However, efforts by government and NGOs to provide reliable sources of drinking water get jeopardized by poor handling and storage that contaminate the drinking water after it has been drawn from the source [8]. Findings by Parker et al. [14] with similar studies by Amenu et al. and Schriewer et al. [15, 16] show that household water quality is compromised by storage methods after collection, thus increasing the proportion of people drinking unsafe water. In a study by Raju et al. [7], household water showed progressive contamination during storage, and in this study, 73% stored household water samples were contaminated with enteric bacteria.

While rural areas may not have the necessary facilities to process water to be fit for human consumption, abundance of natural pure spring water may be a way to make up for living in water treatment resources poor setting. Protected water may not necessarily be significantly contaminated to pose a public health risk, but the handling from the source to many homes and the pattern of storage before water is finally consumed pose the main challenge for stakeholders including water consumers, water resource managers, and water storage facilities at communities and household levels. While the total coliforms and Escherichia coli in water are known to indicate the hygienic condition and health risks associated with water contamination [1], the magnitude of water contamination associated with handling and storage pattern is not clear. As at the time of this study, we are not aware of any report with details of levels of contaminations associated with handling and storage practices in Kirundo, Kisoro District of Uganda. Some interventions on waterborne disease have provided pipeborne water to supplement the central gravity water source used by dwellers in the study area. However, the available report on water crisis and associated health problems show need for interventions to stakeholders.

Assessment of water quality to ensure microbiological safety is a vital public health function to prevent waterborne diseases. The TC and E. coli examination provide indication of the hygienic condition of drinking water and are major tools in the assessment of the health risks to waterborne pathogens [1]. Unfortunately, there is insufficient information on the TC and E. coli amounts in the common drinking water sources in Kirundo subcounty, Kisoro District, Uganda. It is based on this premise information gap about water contamination despite interventions that this study sought to assess the contamination potentials of household water handling and storage practices in Kirundo subcounty, Kisoro District, Uganda.

2. Materials and Methods

2.1. Study Design

A cross-sectional and descriptive study was carried out in Kirundo subcounty, Kisoro District, Uganda, from June to October 2017.

2.2. Area of the Study

The study was carried out in Kirundo subcounty which is located in northern Bufumbira, Kisoro District, Uganda. The subcounty borders the Bwindi Impenetrable National Park (BINP) in the north, Bukimbiri and Nyundo subcounties in the east, Nyabwishenya in the west, and Busanza subcounty in the south. Kirundo subcounty is composed of two parishes (Rubuguri and Rutaka) with 29 villages. The study area was selected based on the dense population and health records from the servicing health facility (Rubuguri Health Centre IV) which indicated higher cases of waterborne diseases.

2.3. Water Sources

A total of 344 water samples were collected from protected water source (Bikingi Gravity Water), unprotected water sources (i.e., springs, ponds, and rivers), and household drinking water for bacteriological analysis of total coliforms and Escherichia coli as an indicator of faecal contamination.

2.4. Water Sample Analysis for Total Coliforms and Escherichia coli

The water samples were analysed for the presence of total coliforms by using the Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater adapted from the American Public Health Association 1999 based on the Most Probable Number (MPN) technique [8].

2.5. Data Analysis and Management

Data were collected, coded, entered in EpiData version 3.0, and exported to the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 16.0. Quantitative data were analysed using STATA and presented in a tabular form using frequencies and percentages for easy interpretation. To establish relationships, bivariate robust Poisson regression analysis and multivariate robust Poisson regression analysis were done. The results were reported in terms of ratios at 95% confidence interval, and a value of 0.05 was considered significant.

2.6. Quality Control

To ensure quality, water samples were transported on ice in a cool box and analysed within 2–4 hours. Additionally, samples were analysed in triplicate using standard methods. Equipment was calibrated before use, and a blank sample and a spiked sample were included in the analysis, and a reference laboratory National Water and Sewerage Corporation (NWSC) was used for validation of the findings.

2.7. Ethical Considerations

Approval to conduct the study was obtained from Kampala International University-Western Campus, Institutional Research and Ethics Committee (KIU-WC, IREC), and request of permission from District Health Officer, authorities of Rubuguri water supply scheme, and Park Warden, Bwindi Impenetrable National Park.

3. Results

3.1. Sociodemographic Characteristics of Study Participants

Majority of the participants (33%) were aged between 41 and 51 years whereas 4% (13/300) were above 61 years. In this study, females were about 30% more than males, with the least number of participants having completed tertiary education. Close to 70% of the participants were peasants. Most of the participants inhabited Kashija and Nyabaremura (Table 1).

3.2. Factors Associated with Domestic Water Contamination

The main container used for storage of drinking water was an open jerrican. Over 90% of the participants treated their drinking water, and the most popular method for treating water was boiling. The results showed that 204 (or 68%) of the community members did not wash their hands after visiting the latrine. Details of these findings are shown in Table 2.

3.3. Total Coliforms Contamination in Drinking Water at Household Level

From the samples collected, 25% (74/300) of drinking water samples from households were contaminated with total coliform. Household drinking water stored in jars and closed bottles showed more contamination with total coliform than drinking water stored in a jerrican. This was significantly different from water stored in a closed jerrican, as shown in Table 3.

3.4. Escherichia coli Contamination in Drinking Water at Household Level

The results indicated that 8.7% (26/300) of samples collected from household drinking water were found positive for Escherichia coli. Household drinking water stored in jar and bottles were more contaminated with Escherichia coli. This was significantly different from water stored in a closed jerrican, as shown in Table 4.

4. Discussion

The findings of this study established that 25% of the household water samples intended for drinking was contaminated with total coliforms (TCs) and 8.7% contaminated with E. coli. The findings were lower probably as result of some community members using protected water source which was found safe, where majority people (88.7%) were reported treating their household drinking water. The findings were close to [9], where 17.1% of household water samples exceeded acceptable levels of total coliforms and 9.5% exceeded acceptable levels of E. coli and raw water consumption assumed to be the primary route of exposure to contaminated water.

At the bivariate analysis, findings indicated that the most significant factors or practices associated with total coliform contamination in household drinking water were education, occupation, water storage container, methods of water treatment, and days of water storage. Findings showed that storage practices of household drinking water that was stored in jar and bottles were highly contaminated with TCs, and , respectively. Participants who used SODIS (solar disinfection) bottles were approximately two times as more likely to have their household water contaminated with total coliform as those who used the boiling method (cPR = 2.17, ). At the multivariate level, SODIS was more than 1.2 times contaminated with total coliform as compared to the boiling method ( ). This is quite different from the study by Fard et al. [5], where all the bottled drinking water brands analysed were found free from coliforms. Presence of TC in drinking water contravenes the Uganda drinking water standard and World Health Organization drinking water guidelines of 0 CFUs/100 ml. From observation, people stored drinking water in open jars which were dirty and in poor housing and sanitation conditions. Studies from [1, 10] show that there is a progressive contamination of water from source to the point of consumption at the households mostly attributed to dirty collection or storage containers. The study findings also indicated that hand washing after toilet use was 63% less likely to be associated with household drinking water contamination by total coliform ( ). However, majority 68% of the people lacked the practice of hand washing. Lack of hygienic practices such as hand washing with soap after visiting latrines is a direct route to household water contamination. Contamination of hands, utensils, food, and clothing can also play a role, particularly when domestic sanitation and hygiene are poor, leading to outbreak of sanitation-related diseases such as cholera and typhoid [11]. It is generally difficult to guarantee good water quality beyond the water source, due to the poor hygiene practices, which result in significant deterioration of the quality of water from the time it is collected from the source to the time it is finally consumed [1, 10].

Approximately 43.2% of samples from water sources were contaminated with TC and 34.1% of samples contaminated with E. coli. The findings were lower than that in Manonyane community, Maseru District (Lesotho), where TC was detected in 97% and E. coli in 71% of the water samples in unprotected water sources [12]. The findings showed that tap water was not contaminated with TC ( ) but within Uganda and WHO guidelines of rural drinking water of 0 CFU/100 ml [3]. Probably, this could be related to the fact that the study was done in a rural setting where piped water was completely free from waste water from sewage which would be a source of contamination in most urban settings. The findings were similar to a study that was done by Raeisia et al. [13], where drinking water samples in the distribution network system had zero total coliform and zero faecal coliform. Findings indicated that all samples collected from ponds were 100% grossly contaminated with both TC and E. coli ( ), values exceeding the WHO guideline value of TC less than 10 CFUs/100 ml and zero E. coli per 100 ml water sample. In a study by Bain et al. [3] and Raeisia et al. [13], the quality of traditional water sources and ponds and rivers is always poor throughout the year but worst during the transition from dry to wet seasons.

All samples analysed from rivers had TC, and 66.7% had E. coli ( ), and the concentration levels of TC and E. coli were above the permissible limits, i.e., 0 CFUs/100 ml (conformity) and 1–10 CFUs/100 ml (low risk) according to World Health Organization drinking water quality guidelines. The rivers Kafuga and Kashasha had a high level of TC counts than the river Karenganyambi. The two rivers are located in valleys, and when it rains, the water runoff from the farms and households end up into these rivers. According to studies [4, 14], heavy rainfalls drain animal and human wastes and other wastes into the water bodies, explaining the high coliform counts observed during wet periods. Water quality is typically compromised following rainfall which brings the coliform alongside [3, 15]. It was noted during data collection that open defecation was still practiced. This implied that when it rained, all this was carried to water bodies leading to contamination. From observations by the researcher, the community shared water sources with animals (cattle). The community collects water for domestic use from the rivers Kafuga and Kashasha from which animals (cattle) take water as well as contaminating the rivers with faeces and urine. The sharing of water sources with animals could partly explain the gross contamination of rivers and ponds. In a study [6, 16, 17], Escherichia coli and other groups of coliforms may be present where there has been faecal contamination originating from warm-blooded animals, and the major source of E. coli is from animals, since it is a normal flora in animal (cattle) intestines. In a study by Olowe et al. [12], mentioned conditions and practices that seem to contribute to increased total coliform and Escherichia coli count as no protection of water sources from livestock faeces.

Springs represent a very significant proportion of improved water supplies provided to communities in developing countries. However, findings revealed 8.3% of the samples had TC ( ) with no E. coli ( ). These findings were lower than that in Manonyane community, Maseru District (Lesotho), where 38% of the samples from unprotected springs had E. coli compared to 11% samples in protected springs [12]. Also findings were far lower from suburban areas of Kampala city, where total counts in 90% of the spring samples exceeded the WHO guidelines for drinking water [14]. From these findings, the possible spring water contamination was from sewage. Higabiro spring was contaminated and located in the valley such that when it rained, it would be flooded with heavy mud allowing little water to flow. This forced children to use a stick through the pipe to allow more water to flow which could partly explain the presence of coliforms in the spring water. Studies by Thomas et al. [18] showed that quality of such sources is often very variable and frequently shows gross contamination particularly during the wet seasons. Kashija spring lacked adequate protection and yet inadequate spring protection may lead to contamination of springs with pathogenic bacteria [3, 13, 14]. Absence of a fence allows animals near the well, whose excreta could be a source of contamination.

5. Conclusions

The overall results indicated that there is a strong linkage between microbiological (TC and E. coli) water quality and water source sanitation; hence, the protected water source was safer than unprotected water sources. The household drinking water was contaminated with both TC and E. coli, hence an exposure route to waterborne diseases. Factors that were found to be associated with bacterial contamination in the household water were age, education level, occupation, water storage container, and method of household water treatment. It is possible that community education, adoption, and promotion of appropriate water safety plans can reduce the increasing incidences of waterborne disease in the area.

At least 16 bodies have been recovered after torrential rain caused landslides in western Uganda, the Red Cross has said.

“Our team continues to recover more bodies including some that are trapped by cocoa trees in Bundibugyo hills. It is a very devastating moment,” the humanitarian agency said in a tweet on Sunday.

An aid team has been deployed to search and recover bodies in Bundibugyo district, which was affected by the landslides after days of heavy rainfall.

“We have provided body bags and blankets to manage the dead in a dignified manner before handing them over to families and hospitals,” Irene Nakasita, Red Cross spokeswoman, said.

The East African nation is undergoing its second rainy season, which has reached its peak in most parts of the country. The Uganda National Meteorological Authority has predicted heavy rainfall will continue throughout December.

The heavy rains have caused destructive flooding in several low-lying parts of the country and landslides in the mountainous regions. Destructive wind and hailstorms have ravaged plantations and crops across Uganda.

More than 20 people have been killed as a result of floods and mudslides in the last week in Uganda. The eastern parts of the country have also been suffering floods and landslides around the Mount Elgon region.

In a statement on Friday, Musa Ecweru, Uganda’s minister of state for disaster preparedness, said: “Four people were killed in Bududa district and another four including two children in Sironko district.”

“Over 10,000 people have been displaced in eastern Uganda alone and we are currently reviewing villages’ household registers to establish the number and names of missing persons,” Ecweru said.

The government has now released more than $5.4m for emergency procurement.

These include inflatable boats, tarpaulins, blankets, relief food, drugs for water-borne diseases and culverts for fixing washed away bridges.

The extreme weather has been blamed on the Indian Ocean Dipole – a climate system defined by the difference in sea surface temperature between western and eastern areas of the ocean.

At the moment, the ocean around East Africa is far warmer than usual, resulting in higher evaporation and moist air flowing inwards over the continent as rain: the hallmarks of a “positive” dipole.

Scientists warn that as ocean temperatures rise because of climate change, Indian Ocean dipoles will become more frequent and severe.","Red Cross says at least 16 bodies recovered after torrential rain causes landslides in Bundibugyo district.

733,https://www.wvi.org/stories/uganda/how-piped-water-project-came-handy-fight-spread-covid-19,How a piped water project came in handy to fight the spread of COVID-19,"By Borrice Natukwatsa

“In the past years, Busia District —and more specifically Busia Municipal council— would never survive epidemics like cholera. I remember in 2014, Busia lost seven people and over 100 people were admitted with cholera at Busia Health Centre IV. The following year in 2015, about 241 were admitted and treated for the same. The majority of the cases were reported in Busia Municipal Council. This was attributed to poor sanitation, poor waste management and inadequate access to clean and safe drinking water,” says Chris Wanyama, a member of the Busia Village Health Teams (VHTs).

At the time, World Vision stepped in; engaging with community leaders and other stakeholders of Busia Municipality to come up with lasting solutions. Some of these solutions included identifying and training parish-level water user committees and community sanitation monitoring teams to ensure proper functionality of various water sources; as well as supporting extension of safe and clean piped water to villages that were water stressed, and those that did not have access to piped water.

Chris says during the accessibility assessment, Kisenyi B was mapped out as one of the villages that had limited access to piped water. The community was excited to hear the good news of the extension of piped water to their village.

Amos Wabwire, who lives in the community, says: “God has finally heard our outcry for safe and clean water.”

As a contribution, Amos offered part of his small plot of land to support the construction of a public water kiosk where households which could not afford their own tap water could still access safe and clean water. According to Chris, it was in September 2017 that World Vision completed the extension of piped water into Kisenyi B, constructed two public water kiosks and two stand taps. The constructed public stand taps and kiosks were handed over to the host landlords for management and maintenance.

Amos hired Patience Nayebale, a resident of the same village, to manage the kiosk. Patience, a mother of one, says she has been able to collect some money to take care of her family. On average, she collects UGX 30,000 (USD 8) for every 10 units of water sold. Out of this amount, she pays the municipal council national water office about UGX13,000 (USD 3.5) every four to five days and keeps the remaining UGX17,000 (USD 4.5) for herself.

With increased access to clean and safe piped water, the community now reports increased reduction in waterborne diseases among children (especially cholera). Patience says she now pays less on medical bills because her child rarely suffers from preventable diseases like dysentery and cholera.

Chris adds that having piped water in the village has also saved community members time that they previously used to look for water. The time is now used for more productive activities.

Fighting COVID-19

With access to clean and safe water, the community is able to fight the spread of COVID-19. Chris says with the current Ministry of Health guidelines calling for frequent hand-washing as part of the fight against the virus, the availability of clean and safe water at the public kiosks is very handy.

“We have enough water for hand-washing. The availability of clean and safe water has also made our work as VHTs much easier. We would expect questions like ‘how are we expected to frequently wash our hands when we can’t access the water?’ But now, whenever we go to sensitise the community about hand-washing, they are open to adhering to the message because they have the water,” he says.","Chris says during the accessibility assessment, Kisenyi B was mapped out as one of the villages that had limited access to piped water.

Domestic violence is on the rise. These are just some of the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic and its restrictions in an area where water is scarce, says Mr Kikora Masereka, of Kyahwire zone, Karangura Sub County in Kabarole District of Western Uganda.

“The challenges we have got during the lockdown due to Covid-19 is increased pregnancy due to young girls walking long distances to fetch water at far water sources,” Masereka said.

“Previously men and women have been fetching the water, but now due to schools’ closure, parents send their children to water sources and boys have taken advantage of that,” he adds.

“We are now starting a dry season (June to August); we are going to face a lot of challenges of domestic violence because of long queues at water sources. It will force women who fetch water more than men to delay at water sources. And usually men think that they were not at the water sources but had gone for other men,” he added.

Mr Chris Tumuranzye, the LCI chairperson for Kyahwire zone, says he is facing a lot of challenges leading a community that is water-stressed amid the dangers of Covid-19.","“The challenges we have got during the lockdown due to Covid-19 is increased pregnancy due to young girls walking long distances to fetch water at far water sources,” Masereka said.
